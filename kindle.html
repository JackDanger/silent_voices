  Chapter
  1
</h4>
<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  In the beginning God{After "God," the Hebrew has the two letters
          "Aleph Tav" (the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet)
          as a grammatical marker.} created the heavens and the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  Now the earth was formless and empty.  Darkness was on the surface
          of the deep.  God's Spirit was hovering over the surface
          of the waters.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  God saw the light, and saw that it was good.  God divided
          the light from the darkness.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
          There was evening and there was morning, one day.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters,
          and let it divide the waters from the waters."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under
          the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse;
          and it was so.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  God called the expanse sky.  There was evening and there
          was morning, a second day.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together
          to one place, and let the dry land appear;" and it was so.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together
          of the waters he called Seas.  God saw that it was good.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  God said, "Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed,
          and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed
          in it, on the earth;" and it was so.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind,
          and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind;
          and God saw that it was good.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to
          divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs,
          and for seasons, and for days and years;
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light
          on the earth;" and it was so.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  God made the two great lights:  the greater light to rule
          the day, and the lesser light to rule the night.
          He also made the stars.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide
          the light from the darkness.  God saw that it was good.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures,
          and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  God created the large sea creatures, and every living
          creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed,
          after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind.
          God saw that it was good.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
          the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures after
          their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth
          after their kind;" and it was so.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  God made the animals of the earth after their kind,
          and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps
          on the ground after its kind.  God saw that it was good.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>26</sup>
  God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
          and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
          and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock,
          and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that
          creeps on the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>27</sup>
  God created man in his own image.  In God's image he created him;
          male and female he created them.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>28</sup>
  God blessed them.  God said to them, "Be fruitful, multiply,
          fill the earth, and subdue it.  Have dominion over the fish
          of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living
          thing that moves on the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>29</sup>
  God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed,
          which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree,
          which bears fruit yielding seed.  It will be your food.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>30</sup>
  To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky,
          and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life,
          I have given every green herb for food;" and it was so.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>31</sup>
  God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.
          There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.

  Chapter
  2
</h4>
<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  The heavens and the earth were finished, and all their vast array.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  On the seventh day God finished his work which he had made;
          and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which
          he had made.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested
          in it from all his work which he had created and made.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of
          the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God
          made the earth and the heavens.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of
          the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it
          to rain on the earth.  There was not a man to till the ground,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole
          surface of the ground.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground,
          and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
          became a living soul.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put
          the man whom he had formed.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is
          pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life
          also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge
          of good and evil.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there
          it was parted, and became four heads.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  The name of the first is Pishon:  this is the one which flows
          through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  and the gold of that land is good.  There is aromatic resin
          and the onyx stone.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  The name of the second river is Gihon:  the same river that flows
          through the whole land of Cush.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  The name of the third river is Hiddekel:  this is the one which
          flows in front of Assyria.  The fourth river is the Euphrates.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden
          to dress it and to keep it.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden
          you may freely eat;
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall
          not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of it you
          will surely die."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Yahweh God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone;
          I will make him a helper suitable for him."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field,
          and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see
          what he would call them.  Whatever the man called every
          living creature, that was its name.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky,
          and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not
          found a helper suitable for him.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept;
          and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh
          in its place.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  He made the rib, which Yahweh God had taken from the man,
          into a woman, and brought her to the man.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  The man said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.
          She will be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother,
          and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  They were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

<h4>
  Chapter
  3
</h4>
<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field
          which Yahweh God had made.  He said to the woman, "Has God
          really said, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  The woman said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees
          of the garden we may eat,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden,
          God has said, 'You shall not eat of it, neither shall you
          touch it, lest you die.'"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  The serpent said to the woman, "You won't surely die,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened,
          and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
          was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired
          to make one wise, she took of the fruit of it, and ate;
          and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  The eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew
          that they were naked.  They sewed fig leaves together,
          and made themselves aprons.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  They heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in
          the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves
          from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  The man said, "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
          because I was naked; and I hid myself."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  God said, "Who told you that you were naked?  Have you eaten
          from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me,
          she gave me of the tree, and I ate."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Yahweh God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?"
          The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Yahweh God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this,
          cursed are you above all livestock, and above every animal
          of the field.  On your belly shall you go, and you shall eat
          dust all the days of your life.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your
          offspring and her offspring.  He will bruise your head,
          and you will bruise his heel."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain
          in childbirth.  In pain you will bring forth children.
          Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  To Adam he said, "Because you have listened to your wife's voice,
          and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying,
          'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground for your sake.
          In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Thorns also and thistles will it bring forth to you;
          and you will eat the herb of the field.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  By the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you
          return to the ground, for out of it you were taken.
          For you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  The man called his wife Eve, because she was the mother
          of all living.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  Yahweh God made coats of skins for Adam and for his wife,
          and clothed them.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  Yahweh God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us,
          knowing good and evil.  Now, lest he put forth his hand,
          and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever..."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  Therefore Yahweh God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
          to till the ground from which he was taken.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  So he drove out the man; and he placed Cherubs at the east
          of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword which turned
          every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.

  <sup>1</sup>
  The man knew Eve his wife.  She conceived, and gave birth to Cain,
          and said, "I have gotten a man with Yahweh's help."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  Again she gave birth, to Cain's brother Abel.  Abel was a keeper
          of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  As time passed, it happened that Cain brought an offering
          to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of
          the fat of it.  Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  but he didn't respect Cain and his offering.  Cain was very angry,
          and the expression on his face fell.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Yahweh said to Cain, "Why are you angry?  Why has the expression
          of your face fallen?
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  If you do well, will it not be lifted up?  If you don't do well,
          sin crouches at the door.  Its desire is for you, but you
          are to rule over it."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  Cain said to Abel, his brother, "Let's go into the field."
          It happened when they were in the field, that Cain rose up
          against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  Yahweh said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?"
          He said, "I don't know.  Am I my brother's keeper?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  Yahweh said, "What have you done?  The voice of your brother's
          blood cries to me from the ground.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened
          its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  From now on, when you till the ground, it won't yield its
          strength to you.  You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer
          in the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Behold, you have driven me out this day from the surface
          of the ground.  I will be hidden from your face,
          and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.
          It will happen that whoever finds me will kill me."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  Yahweh said to him, "Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will
          be taken on him sevenfold."  Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain,
          lest any finding him should strike him.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  Cain went out from Yahweh's presence, and lived in the land
          of Nod, east of Eden.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  Cain knew his wife.  She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch.
          He built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name
          of his son, Enoch.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  To Enoch was born Irad.  Irad became the father of Mehujael.
          Mehujael became the father of Methushael.  Methushael became
          the father of Lamech.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  Lamech took two wives:  the name of the one was Adah,
          and the name of the other Zillah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell
          in tents and have livestock.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  His brother's name was Jubal, who was the father of all who
          handle the harp and pipe.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting
          instrument of brass and iron.  Tubal Cain's sister was Naamah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.
          You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, for I have slain
          a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  If Cain will be avenged seven times, truly Lamech
          seventy-seven times."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  Adam knew his wife again.  She gave birth to a son, and named
          him Seth, "for God has appointed me another child instead
          of Abel, for Cain killed him."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>26</sup>
  There was also born a son to Seth, and he named him Enosh.
          Then men began to call on Yahweh's name.

<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  It happened, when men began to multiply on the surface
          of the ground, and daughters were born to them,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  that God's sons saw that men's daughters were beautiful,
          and they took for themselves wives of all that they chose.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  Yahweh said, "My Spirit will not strive with man forever,
          because he also is flesh; yet will his days be one
          hundred twenty years."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also
          after that, when God's sons came in to men's daughters.
          They bore children to them.  Those were the mighty men
          who were of old, men of renown.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
          and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was
          only evil continually.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it
          grieved him in his heart.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Yahweh said, "I will destroy man whom I have created
          from the surface of the ground; man, along with animals,
          creeping things, and birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I
          have made them."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  But Noah found favor in Yahweh's eyes.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  This is the history of the generations of Noah.  Noah was
          a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time.
          Noah walked with God.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  Noah became the father of three sons:  Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was
          filled with violence.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh
          had corrupted their way on the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before me,
          for the earth is filled with violence through them.
          Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Make a ship of gopher wood.  You shall make rooms in the ship,
          and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  This is how you shall make it.  The length of the ship will
          be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits,
          and the height of it thirty cubits.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  You shall make a roof in the ship, and to a cubit shall you finish
          it upward.  You shall set the door of the ship in its side.
          You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  I, even I, do bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy
          all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky.
          Everything that is in the earth will die.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  But I will establish my covenant with you.  You shall come
          into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons'
          wives with you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two
          of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you.
          They shall be male and female.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind,
          of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind,
          two of every sort shall come to you, to keep them alive.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  Take with you of all food that is eaten, and gather it to you;
          and it will be for food for you, and for them."

  Yahweh said to Noah, "Come with all of your household into
          the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me
          in this generation.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you,
          the male and his female.  Of the animals that are not clean,
          take two, the male and his female.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and female,
          to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty
          days and forty nights.  Every living thing that I have made,
          I will destroy from the surface of the ground."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him.

<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came
          on the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Noah went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons'
          wives, because of the waters of the flood.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  Clean animals, animals that are not clean, birds, and everything
          that creeps on the ground
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  went by pairs to Noah into the ship, male and female,
          as God commanded Noah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  It happened after the seven days, that the waters of the flood
          came on the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
          on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all
          the fountains of the great deep were burst open, and the sky's
          windows were opened.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  The rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah,
          and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them,
          entered into the ship;
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after
          their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth
          after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird
          of every sort.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  They went to Noah into the ship, by pairs of all flesh with
          the breath of life in them.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh,
          as God commanded him; and Yahweh shut him in.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  The flood was forty days on the earth.  The waters increased,
          and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  The waters prevailed, and increased greatly on the earth;
          and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  The waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth.  All the high
          mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the
          mountains were covered.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds,
          livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth,
          and every man.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life,
          of all that was on the dry land, died.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface
          of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things,
          and birds of the sky.  They were destroyed from the earth.
          Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  The waters prevailed on the earth one hundred fifty days.

<h4>

<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were
          with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth.
          The waters subsided.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  The deep's fountains and the sky's windows were also stopped,
          and the rain from the sky was restrained.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  The waters receded from the earth continually.  After the end
          of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day
          of the month, on Ararat's mountains.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  The waters receded continually until the tenth month.
          In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops
          of the mountains were seen.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  It happened at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window
          of the ship which he had made,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  and he sent forth a raven.  It went back and forth,
          until the waters were dried up from the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  He sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated
          from the surface of the ground,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned
          to him into the ship; for the waters were on the surface
          of the whole earth.  He put forth his hand, and took her,
          and brought her to him into the ship.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  He stayed yet another seven days; and again he sent forth
          the dove out of the ship.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  The dove came back to him at evening, and, behold, in her mouth
          was an olive leaf plucked off.  So Noah knew that the waters
          were abated from the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  He stayed yet another seven days, and sent forth the dove;
          and she didn't return to him any more.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  It happened in the six hundred first year, in the first month,
          the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth.
          Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked.
          He saw that the surface of the ground was dried.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month,
          the earth was dry.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  God spoke to Noah, saying,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  "Go out of the ship, you, and your wife, and your sons,
          and your sons' wives with you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you
          of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping
          thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly
          in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Noah went forth, with his sons, his wife, and his sons'
          wives with him.

<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves
          on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal,
          and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings
          on the altar.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  Yahweh smelled the sweet savor.  Yahweh said in his heart,
          "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake,
          because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth;
          neither will I ever again strike everything living,
          as I have done.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat,
          and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."

<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful,
          and multiply, and replenish the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every
          animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky.
          Everything that the ground teems with, and all the fish
          of the sea are delivered into your hand.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  Every moving thing that lives will be food for you.
          As the green herb, I have given everything to you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  But flesh with the life of it, the blood of it, you shall not eat.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  I will surely require your blood of your lives.
          At the hand of every animal I will require it.
          At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother,
          I will require the life of man.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Whoever sheds man's blood, his blood will be shed by man,
          for God made man in his own image.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Be fruitful and multiply.  Bring forth abundantly in the earth,
          and multiply in it."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  "As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you,
          and with your offspring after you,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  and with every living creature that is with you:  the birds,
          the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you,
          of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  I will establish my covenant with you:  all flesh will not be cut
          off any more by the waters of the flood, neither will there
          ever again be a flood to destroy the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  God said, "This is the token of the covenant which I make
          between me and you and every living creature that is with you,
          for perpetual generations:
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be for a sign
          of a covenant between me and the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  It will happen, when I bring a cloud over the earth,
          that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you
          and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will
          no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  The rainbow will be in the cloud.  I will look at it, that I
          may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every
          living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  God said to Noah, "This is the token of the covenant which I
          have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  The sons of Noah who went forth from the ship were Shem, Ham,
          and Japheth.  Ham is the father of Canaan.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  These three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the whole
          earth was populated.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  He drank of the wine and got drunk.  He was uncovered
          within his tent.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,
          and told his two brothers outside.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders,
          went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father.
          Their faces were backwards, and they didn't see
          their father's nakedness.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had
          done to him.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  He said, "Canaan is cursed.  He will be servant of servants
          to his brothers."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>26</sup>
  He said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem.  Let Canaan
          be his servant.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>27</sup>
  May God enlarge Japheth.  Let him dwell in the tents of Shem.
          Let Canaan be his servant."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>28</sup>
  Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>29</sup>
  All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, then he died.

  Chapter

</h4>
<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah
          and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  Sons were born to them
          after the flood.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  The sons of Japheth:  Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech,
          and Tiras.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  The sons of Gomer:  Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  The sons of Javan:  Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands,
          everyone after his language, after their families,
          in their nations.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  The sons of Ham:  Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  The sons of Cush:  Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca.
          The sons of Raamah:  Sheba and Dedan.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  Cush became the father of Nimrod.  He began to be a mighty
          one in the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh.  Therefore it is said,
          "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh,
          in the land of Shinar.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and built
          Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from),
          and Caphtorim.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  the Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite.
          Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you go
          toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah,
          and Zeboiim, to Lasha.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  These are the sons of Ham, after their families,
          after their languages, in their lands, in their nations.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  To Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder
          brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  The sons of Shem:  Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  The sons of Aram:  Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  Arpachshad became the father of Shelah.  Shelah became
          the father of Eber.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  To Eber were born two sons.  The name of the one was Peleg,
          for in his days the earth was divided.  His brother's
          name was Joktan.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>26</sup>
  Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>27</sup>
  Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>28</sup>
  Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>29</sup>
  Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab.  All these were the sons of Joktan.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>30</sup>
  Their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar,
          the mountain of the east.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>31</sup>
  These are the sons of Shem, after their families,
          after their languages, in their lands, after their nations.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>32</sup>
  These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations,
          in their nations.  Of these were the nations divided in the earth
          after the flood.

<h4>
  Chapter
  11
</h4>
<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  It happened, as they traveled east, that they found a plain
          in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  They said one to another, "Come, let's make bricks, and burn
          them thoroughly."  They had brick for stone, and they used
          tar for mortar.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  They said, "Come, let's build ourselves a city, and a tower
          whose top reaches to the sky, and let's make ourselves a name,
          lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children
          of men built.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Yahweh said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have
          all one language, and this is what they begin to do.
          Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Come, let's go down, and there confuse their language,
          that they may not understand one another's speech."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface
          of all the earth.  They stopped building the city.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  Therefore the name of it was called Babel, because there
          Yahweh confused the language of all the earth.  From there,
          Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  This is the history of the generations of Shem.  Shem was
          one hundred years old and became the father of Arpachshad
          two years after the flood.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father
          of Arpachshad, and became the father of sons and daughters.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father
          of Shelah, and became the father of sons and daughters.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber:
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  and Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became
          the father of Eber, and became the father of sons and daughters.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father
          of Peleg, and became the father of sons and daughters.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father
          of Reu, and became the father of sons and daughters.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father
          of Serug, and became the father of sons and daughters.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor,
          and became the father of sons and daughters.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father
          of Terah, and became the father of sons and daughters.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>26</sup>
  Terah lived seventy years, and became the father
          of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>27</sup>
  Now this is the history of the generations of Terah.
          Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
          Haran became the father of Lot.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>28</sup>
  Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth,
          in Ur of the Chaldees.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>29</sup>
  Abram and Nahor took wives.  The name of Abram's wife was Sarai,
          and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran
          who was also the father of Iscah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>30</sup>
  Sarai was barren.  She had no child.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>31</sup>
  Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son's son,
          and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife.  They went
          forth from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan.
          They came to Haran and lived there.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>32</sup>
  The days of Terah were two hundred five years.
          Terah died in Haran.
</p>
<a name='01_012'></a>
<h4>
  Chapter
  12
</h4>
<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  Now Yahweh said to Abram, "Get out of your country,
          and from your relatives, and from your father's house,
          to the land that I will show you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  I will make of you a great nation.  I will bless you and make
          your name great.  You will be a blessing.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him
          who curses you.  In you will all of the families of the
          earth be blessed."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  So Abram went, as Yahweh had spoken to him.  Lot went with him.
          Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother's son, all their substance
          that they had gathered, and the souls whom they had gotten
          in Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan.
          Into the land of Canaan they came.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem,
          to the oak of Moreh.  The Canaanite was then in the land.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, "I will give this land to
          your seed{or, offspring}." He built an altar there to Yahweh,
          who appeared to him.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  He left from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel,
          and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai
          on the east.  There he built an altar to Yahweh and called
          on the name of Yahweh.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  Abram traveled, going on still toward the South.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  There was a famine in the land.  Abram went down into Egypt
          to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe
          in the land.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  It happened, when he had come near to enter Egypt, that he said
          to Sarai his wife, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful
          woman to look at.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  It will happen, when the Egyptians will see you, that they
          will say, 'This is his wife.'  They will kill me, but they
          will save you alive.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me
          for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  It happened that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians
          saw that the woman was very beautiful.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh;
          and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  He dealt well with Abram for her sake.  He had sheep,
          oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants,
          female donkeys, and camels.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  Yahweh plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
          because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this that you have done
          to me?  Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife?
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her
          to be my wife?  Now therefore, see your wife, take her,
          and go your way."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him, and they brought him
          on the way with his wife and all that he had.
</p>
<a name='01_013'></a>
<h4>
  Chapter
  13
</h4>
<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  Abram went up out of Egypt:  he, his wife, all that he had,
          and Lot with him, into the South.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  He went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel,
          to the place where his tent had been at the beginning,
          between Bethel and Ai,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first.
          There Abram called on the name of Yahweh.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together:
          for their substance was great, so that they could not live together.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  There was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock
          and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock:  and the Canaanite
          and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  Abram said to Lot, "Please, let there be no strife between
          me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen;
          for we are relatives.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  Isn't the whole land before you?  Please separate yourself from me.
          If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right.
          Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan,
          that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed
          Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land
          of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself.
          Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one
          from the other.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities
          of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners
          against Yahweh.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, "Now,
          lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are,
          northward and southward and eastward and westward,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to
          your offspring forever.
</p>
<p>

  I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that

  Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre,
          which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.

  <sup>1</sup>
  It happened in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch,
          king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal,
          king of Goiim,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  that they made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha,
          king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber,
          king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (the same
          is the Salt Sea).
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth
          year, they rebelled.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who
          were with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim,
          and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is
          by the wilderness.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  They returned, and came to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh),
          and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites,
          that lived in Hazazon Tamar.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king
          of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela
          (the same is Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array
          against them in the valley of Siddim;
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
          and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;
          four kings against the five.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings
          of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and those
          who remained fled to the hills.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food,
          and went their way.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  They took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who lived in Sodom,
          and his goods, and departed.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew.
          Now he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol,
          and brother of Aner; and these were allies of Abram.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led forth
          his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen,
          and pursued as far as Dan.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants,
          and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left
          hand of Damascus.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  He brought back all the goods, and also brought back
          his relative, Lot, and his goods, and the women also,
          and the people.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  The king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from
          the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him,
          at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine:
          and he was priest of God Most High.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  He blessed him, and said, "Blessed be Abram of God Most High,
          possessor of heaven and earth:
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies
          into your hand."  Abram gave him a tenth of all.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people,
          and take the goods to yourself."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have lifted up my hand
          to Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything
          that is yours, lest you should say, 'I have made Abram rich.'
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men
          have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me:
          Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre.  Let them take their portion."

  <sup>1</sup>
  After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in
          a vision, saying, "Don't be afraid, Abram.  I am your shield,
          your exceedingly great reward."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  Abram said, "Lord Yahweh, what will you give me, seeing I
          go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is
          Eliezer of Damascus?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  Abram said, "Behold, to me you have given no seed:
          and, behold, one born in my house is my heir."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  Behold, the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, "This man will
          not be your heir, but he who will come forth out of your own
          body will be your heir."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Yahweh brought him outside, and said, "Look now toward the sky,
          and count the stars, if you are able to count them."
          He said to Abram, "So shall your seed be."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  He believed in Yahweh; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  He said to him, "I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur
          of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  He said, "Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  He said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female
          goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove,
          and a young pigeon."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  He brought him all of these, and divided them in the middle,
          and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn't
          divide the birds.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram
          drove them away.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram.
          Now terror and great darkness fell on him.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  He said to Abram, "Know for sure that your seed will live as
          foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them.
          They will afflict them four hundred years.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve.
          Afterward they will come out with great wealth,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  but you will go to your fathers in peace.  You will be buried
          in a good old age.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  In the fourth generation they will come here again,
          for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it
          was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch
          passed between these pieces.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your
          seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to
          the great river, the river Euphrates:
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."

  <sup>1</sup>
  Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children.  She had a handmaid,
          an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  Sarai said to Abram, "See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing.
          Please go in to my handmaid.  It may be that I will obtain
          children by her."  Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid,
          after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan,
          and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  He went in to Hagar, and she conceived.  When she saw that she
          had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Sarai said to Abram, "This wrong is your fault.
          I gave my handmaid into your bosom, and when she saw
          that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes.
          Yahweh judge between me and you."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  But Abram said to Sarai, "Behold, your maid is in your hand.
          Do to her whatever is good in your eyes."  Sarai dealt harshly
          with her, and she fled from her face.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  The angel of Yahweh found her by a fountain of water in
          the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  He said, "Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, where did you come from?
          Where are you going?"  She said, "I am fleeing from the face
          of my mistress Sarai."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  The angel of Yahweh said to her, "Return to your mistress,
          and submit yourself under her hands."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  The angel of Yahweh said to her, "I will greatly multiply
          your seed, that they will not be numbered for multitude."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  The angel of Yahweh said to her, "Behold, you are with child,
          and will bear a son.  You shall call his name Ishmael,
          because Yahweh has heard your affliction.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  He will be like a wild donkey among men.  His hand will
          be against every man, and every man's hand against him.
          He will live opposite all of his brothers."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  She called the name of Yahweh who spoke to her, "You are
          a God who sees," for she said, "Have I even stayed alive
          after seeing him?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi.{Beer Lahai Roi
          means "well of the one who lives and sees me."} Behold,
          it is between Kadesh and Bered.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  Hagar bore a son for Abram.  Abram called the name of his son,
          whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
</p>
<p>

  Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.

  When Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abram,
          and said to him, "I am God Almighty.  Walk before me,
          and be blameless.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  I will make my covenant between me and you, and will
          multiply you exceedingly."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  Abram fell on his face.  God talked with him, saying,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  "As for me, behold, my covenant is with you.  You will be
          the father of a multitude of nations.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Neither will your name any more be called Abram, but your
          name will be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a
          multitude of nations.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you.
          Kings will come out of you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed
          after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant,
          to be a God to you and to your seed after you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land
          where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an
          everlasting possession.  I will be their God."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  God said to Abraham, "As for you, you will keep my covenant,
          you and your seed after you throughout their generations.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me
          and you and your seed after you.  Every male among you
          shall be circumcised.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin.
          It will be a token of the covenant between me and you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  He who is eight days old will be circumcised among you,
          every male throughout your generations, he who is born
          in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is
          not of your seed.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money,
          must be circumcised.  My covenant will be in your flesh
          for an everlasting covenant.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh
          of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
          He has broken my covenant."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you shall not
          call her name Sarai, but her name will be Sarah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her.
          Yes, I will bless her, and she will be a mother of nations.
          Kings of peoples will come from her."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart,
          "Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old?
          Will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Abraham said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before you!"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  God said, "No, but Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son.
          You shall call his name Isaac.{Isaac means "he laughs."} I
          will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant
          for his seed after him.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  As for Ishmael, I have heard you.  Behold, I have blessed him,
          and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly.
          He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make
          him a great nation.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  But my covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear
          to you at this set time next year."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  When he finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house,
          and all who were bought with his money; every male among
          the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their
          foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised
          in the flesh of his foreskin.

  Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised
          in the flesh of his foreskin.

<p>
  <sup>26</sup>
  In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>27</sup>
  All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those
          bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.

  Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat
          in the tent door in the heat of the day.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men
          stood opposite him.  When he saw them, he ran to meet them
          from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  and said, "My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight,
          please don't go away from your servant.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest
          yourselves under the tree.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart.
          After that you may go your way, now that you have come to
          your servant."  They said, "Very well, do as you have said."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Quickly make
          ready three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf,
          and gave it to the servant.  He hurried to dress it.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed,
          and set it before them.  He stood by them under the tree,
          and they ate.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  They said to him, "Where is Sarah, your wife?
          He said, "See, in the tent."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  He said, "I will certainly return to you when the season
          comes round.  Behold, Sarah your wife will have a son."
          Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age.
          It had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  Sarah laughed within herself, saying, "After I have grown old
          will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Yahweh said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Will I
          really bear a child, yet I am old?'
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Is anything too hard for Yahweh?  At the set time I will return
          to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  Then Sarah denied, saying, "I didn't laugh," for she was afraid.
          He said, "No, but you did laugh."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom.
          Abraham went with them to see them on their way.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  Yahweh said, "Will I hide from Abraham what I do,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  seeing that Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation,
          and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  For I have known him, to the end that he may command his
          children and his household after him, that they may keep
          the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice;
          to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has
          spoken of him."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  Yahweh said, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,
          and because their sin is very grievous,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad
          as the reports which have come to me.  If not, I will know."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham
          stood yet before Yahweh.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  Abraham drew near, and said, "Will you consume the righteous
          with the wicked?
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  What if there are fifty righteous within the city?
          Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty
          righteous who are in it?
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous
          with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked.
          May that be far from you.  Shouldn't the Judge of all
          the earth do right?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>26</sup>
  Yahweh said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,
          then I will spare all the place for their sake."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>27</sup>
  Abraham answered, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak
          to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>28</sup>
  What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous?
          Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?"  He said,
          "I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>29</sup>
  He spoke to him yet again, and said, "What if there are forty
          found there?"  He said, "I will not do it for the forty's sake."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>30</sup>
  He said, "Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will speak.
          What if there are thirty found there?"  He said, "I will not
          do it, if I find thirty there."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>31</sup>
  He said, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord.
          What if there are twenty found there?"  He said, "I will not
          destroy it for the twenty's sake."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>32</sup>
  He said, "Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will
          speak just once more.  What if ten are found there?"
          He said, "I will not destroy it for the ten's sake."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>33</sup>
  Yahweh went his way, as soon as he had finished communing
          with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.

<h4>
  Chapter
  19
</h4>
<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  The two angels came to Sodom at evening.  Lot sat in the gate
          of Sodom.  Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them.
          He bowed himself with his face to the earth,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  and he said, "See now, my lords, please turn aside into
          your servant's house, stay all night, wash your feet,
          and you will rise up early, and go on your way."
          They said, "No, but we will stay in the street all night."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered
          into his house.  He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread,
          and they ate.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom,
          surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people
          from every quarter.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  They called to Lot, and said to him, "Where are the men
          who came in to you this night?  Bring them out to us,
          that we may have sex with them."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  He said, "Please, my brothers, don't act so wickedly.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  See now, I have two virgin daughters.  Please let me bring them
          out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you.
          Only don't do anything to these men, because they have come
          under the shadow of my roof."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  They said, "Stand back!"  They said, "This one fellow came
          in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge.
          Now will we deal worse with you, than with them!"
          They pressed hard on the man Lot, and drew near to break the door.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house
          to them, and shut the door.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  They struck the men who were at the door of the house
          with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied
          themselves to find the door.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  The men said to Lot, "Do you have anybody else here?
          Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you
          have in the city, bring them out of the place:
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against
          them has grown great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us
          to destroy it."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were
          pledged to marry his daughters, and said, "Get up!
          Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city."
          But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, "Get up!
          Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here,
          lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife's hand,
          and his two daughters' hands, Yahweh being merciful to him;
          and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said,
          "Escape for your life!  Don't look behind you, and don't
          stay anywhere in the plain.  Escape to the mountains,
          lest you be consumed!"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Lot said to them, "Oh, not so, my lord.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you
          have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown
          to me in saving my life.  I can't escape to the mountain,
          lest evil overtake me, and I die.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one.
          Oh let me escape there (isn't it a little one?), and my
          soul will live."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  He said to him, "Behold, I have granted your request concerning
          this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which
          you have spoken.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  Hurry, escape there, for I can't do anything until you get there."
          Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.{Zoar means "little."}
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire
          from Yahweh out of the sky.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants
          of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>26</sup>
  But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became
          a pillar of salt.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>27</sup>
  Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had
          stood before Yahweh.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>28</sup>
  He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land
          of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land
          went up as the smoke of a furnace.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>29</sup>
  It happened, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,
          that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle
          of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>30</sup>
  Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his
          two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar.
          He lived in a cave with his two daughters.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>31</sup>
  The firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old,
          and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us after
          the manner of all the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>32</sup>
  Come, let's make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him,
          that we may preserve our father's seed."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>33</sup>
  They made their father drink wine that night:
          and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father.
          He didn't know when she lay down, nor when she arose.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>34</sup>
  It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said
          to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father.
          Let us make him drink wine again, tonight.  You go in,
          and lie with him, that we may preserve our father's seed."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>35</sup>
  They made their father drink wine that night also.
          The younger went and lay with him.  He didn't know when she
          lay down, nor when she got up.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>36</sup>
  Thus both of Lot's daughters were with child by their father.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>37</sup>
  The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab.  He is the father
          of the Moabites to this day.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>38</sup>
  The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi.
          He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.
