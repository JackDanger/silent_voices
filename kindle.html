<h4>
  Chapter
  1
</h4>
<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  Now the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  God called the light Day, and the darkness she called Night. There was evening and there was morning, one day.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  God called the expanse sky. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;" and it was so.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters she called Seas. God saw that it was good.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  God said, "Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth;" and it was so.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth;" and it was so.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. She also made the stars.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  God created the large sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;" and it was so.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>26</sup>
  God said, "Let us make woman in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>27</sup>
  God created woman in her own image. In God's image she created her; female and male she created them.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>28</sup>
  God blessed them. God said to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>29</sup>
  God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>30</sup>
  To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;" and it was so.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>31</sup>
  God saw everything that she had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.

<h4>
  Chapter
  2
</h4>
<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  The heavens and the earth were finished, and all their vast array.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  On the seventh day God finished her work which she had made; and she rested on the seventh day from all her work which she had made.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because she rested in it from all her work which she had created and made.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a woman to till the ground,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Yahweh God formed woman from the dust of the ground, and breathed into her nostrils the breath of life; and woman became a living soul.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there she put the woman whom she had formed.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became four heads.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  The name of the first is Pishon: this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  and the gold of that land is good. There is aromatic resin and the onyx stone.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  The name of the second river is Gihon: the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  The name of the third river is Hiddekel: this is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  Yahweh God took the woman, and put her into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  Yahweh God commanded the woman, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat;
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Yahweh God said, "It is not good that the woman should be alone; I will make her a helper suitable for her."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the woman to see what she would call them. Whatever the woman called every living creature, that was its name.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  The woman gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for woman there was not found a helper suitable for her.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the woman, and she slept; and she took one of her ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  She made the rib, which Yahweh God had taken from the woman, into a man, and brought him to the woman.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  The woman said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. He will be called Man, because he was taken out of Woman."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  Therefore a woman will leave her mother and her father, and will join with her husband, and they will be one flesh.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  They were both naked, the woman and her husband, and were not ashamed.
</p>
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><a name='01_003'></a>
<h4>
  Chapter
  3
</h4>
<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. She said to the man, "Has God really said, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  The man said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  The serpent said to the man, "You won't surely die,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  When the man saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, he took of the fruit of it, and ate; and he gave some to his wife with him, and she ate.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  The eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  They heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the woman and her husband hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  Yahweh God called to the woman, and said to her, "Where are you?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  The woman said, "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  God said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  The woman said, "The man whom you gave to be with me, he gave me of the tree, and I ate."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Yahweh God said to the man, "What is this you have done?" The man said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Yahweh God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock, and above every animal of the field. On your belly shall you go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  I will put enmity between you and the man, and between your offspring and his offspring. She will bruise your head, and you will bruise her heel."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  To the man she said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. In pain you will bring forth children. Your desire will be for your wife, and she will rule over you."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  To Eve she said, "Because you have listened to your husband's voice, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground for your sake. In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Thorns also and thistles will it bring forth to you; and you will eat the herb of the field.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  By the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  The woman called her husband Adam, because he was the father of all living.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  Yahweh God made coats of skins for Eve and for her husband, and clothed them.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  Yahweh God said, "Behold, the woman has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest she put forth her hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever..."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  Therefore Yahweh God sent her forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which she was taken.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  So she drove out the woman; and she placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.

<h4>
  Chapter
  4
</h4>
<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  The woman knew Adam her husband. He conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said, "I have gotten a woman with Yahweh's help."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  Again he gave birth, to Cain's sister Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  As time passed, it happened that Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  Abel also brought some of the firstborn of her flock and of the fat of it. Yahweh respected Abel and her offering,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  but she didn't respect Cain and her offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on her face fell.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Yahweh said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  If you do well, will it not be lifted up? If you don't do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  Cain said to Abel, her sister, "Let's go into the field." It happened when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel, her sister, and killed her.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  Yahweh said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your sister?" She said, "I don't know. Am I my sister's keeper?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  Yahweh said, "What have you done? The voice of your sister's blood cries to me from the ground.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your sister's blood from your hand.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  From now on, when you till the ground, it won't yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Behold, you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. It will happen that whoever finds me will kill me."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  Yahweh said to her, "Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on her sevenfold." Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding her should strike her.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  Cain went out from Yahweh's presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  Cain knew her husband. He conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. She built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of her daughter, Enoch.
</p>

  To Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the mother of Mehujael. Mehujael became the mother of Methushael. Methushael became the mother of Lamech.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  Lamech took two husbands: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the mother of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  Her sister's name was Jubal, who was the mother of all who handle the harp and pipe.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. Tubal Cain's brother was Naamah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  Lamech said to her husbands, "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice. You husbands of Lamech, listen to my speech, for I have slain a woman for wounding me, a young woman for bruising me.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  If Cain will be avenged seven times, truly Lamech seventy-seven times."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  Eve knew her husband again. He gave birth to a daughter, and named her Seth, "for God has appointed me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed her."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>26</sup>
  There was also born a daughter to Seth, and she named her Enosh. Then women began to call on Yahweh's name.

<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  It happened, when women began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and sons were born to them,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  that God's daughters saw that women's sons were beautiful, and they took for themselves husbands of all that they chose.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  Yahweh said, "My Spirit will not strive with woman forever, because she also is flesh; yet will her days be one hundred twenty years."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when God's daughters came in to women's sons. They bore children to them. Those were the mighty women who were of old, women of renown.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Yahweh saw that the wickedness of woman was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of her heart was only evil continually.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Yahweh was sorry that she had made woman on the earth, and it grieved her in her heart.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Yahweh said, "I will destroy woman whom I have created from the surface of the ground; woman, along with animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  But Noa found favor in Yahweh's eyes.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  This is the history of the generations of Noa. Noa was a righteous woman, blameless among the people of her time. Noa walked with God.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  Noa became the mother of three daughters: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  God said to Noa, "The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Make a ship of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  This is how you shall make it. The length of the ship will be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  You shall make a roof in the ship, and to a cubit shall you finish it upward. You shall set the door of the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  I, even I, do bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will die.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  But I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your daughters, your husband, and your daughters' husbands with you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be female and male.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come to you, to keep them alive.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  Take with you of all food that is eaten, and gather it to you; and it will be for food for you, and for them."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  Thus Noa did. According to all that God commanded her, so she did.

<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  Yahweh said to Noa, "Come with all of your household into the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the female and her male. Of the animals that are not clean, take two, the female and her male.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, female and male, to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. Every living thing that I have made, I will destroy from the surface of the ground."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Noa did everything that Yahweh commanded her.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Noa was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Noa went into the ship with her daughters, her husband, and her daughters' husbands, because of the waters of the flood.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  Clean animals, animals that are not clean, birds, and everything that creeps on the ground
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  went by pairs to Noa into the ship, female and male, as God commanded Noa.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  It happened after the seven days, that the waters of the flood came on the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  In the six hundredth year of Noa's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open, and the sky's windows were opened.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  The rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  In the same day Noa, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the daughters of Noa, and Noa's husband, and the three husbands of her daughters with them, entered into the ship;
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  They went to Noa into the ship, by pairs of all flesh with the breath of life in them.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  Those who went in, went in female and male of all flesh, as God commanded her; and Yahweh shut her in.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  The waters prevailed, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  The waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every woman.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including woman, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noa was left, and those who were with her in the ship.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  The waters prevailed on the earth one hundred fifty days.
</p>
<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div><a name='01_008'></a>
<h4>
  Chapter

</h4>
<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  God remembered Noa, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with her in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  The deep's fountains and the sky's windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  The waters receded from the earth continually. After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat's mountains.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  The waters receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  It happened at the end of forty days, that Noa opened the window of the ship which she had made,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  and she sent forth a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  She sent forth a dove from her, to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  but the dove found no place to rest his foot, and he returned to her into the ship; for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. She put forth her hand, and took him, and brought him to her into the ship.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  She stayed yet another seven days; and again she sent forth the dove out of the ship.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  The dove came back to her at evening, and, behold, in his mouth was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noa knew that the waters were abated from the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  She stayed yet another seven days, and sent forth the dove; and he didn't return to her any more.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  It happened in the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noa removed the covering of the ship, and looked. She saw that the surface of the ground was dried.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  God spoke to Noa, saying,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  "Go out of the ship, you, and your husband, and your daughters, and your daughters' husbands with you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Noa went forth, with her daughters, her husband, and her daughters' husbands with her.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  Noa built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  Yahweh smelled the sweet savor. Yahweh said in her heart, "I will not again curse the ground any more for woman's sake, because the imagination of woman's heart is evil from her youth; neither will I ever again strike everything living, as I have done.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."

  God blessed Noa and her daughters, and said to them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that the ground teems with, and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As the green herb, I have given everything to you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  But flesh with the life of it, the blood of it, you shall not eat.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  I will surely require your blood of your lives. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of woman, even at the hand of every woman's sister, I will require the life of woman.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Whoever sheds woman's blood, her blood will be shed by woman, for God made woman in her own image.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Be fruitful and multiply. Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  God spoke to Noa and to her daughters with her, saying,

  "As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you,

</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  I will establish my covenant with you: all flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood, neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  God said, "This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.

<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  It will happen, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,

<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

  <sup>16</sup>
  The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."

  God said to Noa, "This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."
</p>

  <sup>18</sup>
  The daughters of Noa who went forth from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the mother of Canaan.
</p>

  <sup>19</sup>
  These three were the daughters of Noa, and from these, the whole earth was populated.
</p>

  <sup>20</sup>
  Noa began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.

<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  She drank of the wine and got drunk. She was uncovered within her tent.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  Ham, the mother of Canaan, saw the nakedness of her mother, and told her two sisters outside.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their mother. Their faces were backwards, and they didn't see their mother's nakedness.

<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  Noa awoke from her wine, and knew what her youngest daughter had done to her.

  <sup>1</sup>
  Now this is the history of the generations of the daughters of Noa and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Daughters were born to them after the flood.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  The daughters of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  The daughters of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  The daughters of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after her language, after their families, in their nations.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  The daughters of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  The daughters of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The daughters of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  Cush became the mother of Nimrod. She began to be a mighty one in the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  She was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  The beginning of her kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  Out of that land she went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Mizraim became the mother of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  Canaan became the mother of Sidon (hers firstborn), Heth,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  the Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you go toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, to Lasha.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  These are the daughters of Ham, after their families, after their languages, in their lands, in their nations.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  To Shem, the mother of all the children of Eber, the elder sister of Japheth, to her also were children born.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  The daughters of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  The daughters of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  Arpachshad became the mother of Shelah. Shelah became the mother of Eber.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  To Eber were born two daughters. The name of the one was Peleg, for in her days the earth was divided. Her sister's name was Joktan.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>26</sup>
  Joktan became the mother of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
</p>

  Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>28</sup>
  Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>29</sup>
  Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the daughters of Joktan.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>30</sup>
  Their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
</p>

<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  It happened, as they traveled east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  They said one to another, "Come, let's make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  They said, "Come, let's build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let's make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of women built.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Yahweh said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Come, let's go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  Therefore the name of it was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  This is the history of the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old and became the mother of Arpachshad two years after the flood.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  Shem lived five hundred years after she became the mother of Arpachshad, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the mother of Shelah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after she became the mother of Shelah, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Shelah lived thirty years, and became the mother of Eber:
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  and Shelah lived four hundred three years after she became the mother of Eber, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the mother of Peleg.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  Eber lived four hundred thirty years after she became the mother of Peleg, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Peleg lived thirty years, and became the mother of Reu.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  Peleg lived two hundred nine years after she became the mother of Reu, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the mother of Serug.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  Reu lived two hundred seven years after she became the mother of Serug, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  Serug lived thirty years, and became the mother of Nahor.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  Serug lived two hundred years after she became the mother of Nahor, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the mother of Terah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after she became the mother of Terah, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>26</sup>
  Terah lived seventy years, and became the mother of Abra, Nahor, and Haran.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>27</sup>
  Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the mother of Abra, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the mother of Lot.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>28</sup>
  Haran died before her mother Terah in the land of her birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>29</sup>
  Abra and Nahor took husbands. The name of Abra's husband was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's husband, Milcah, the son of Haran who was also the mother of Iscah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>30</sup>
  Sarai was barren. He had no child.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>31</sup>
  Terah took Abra her daughter, Lot the daughter of Haran, her daughter's daughter, and Sarai her son-in-law, her daughter Abra's husband. They went forth from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>32</sup>
  The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.

<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  Now Yahweh said to Abra, "Get out of your country, and from your relatives, and from your mother's house, to the land that I will show you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse her who curses you. In you will all of the families of the earth be blessed."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  So Abra went, as Yahweh had spoken to her. Lot went with her. Abra was seventy-five years old when she departed out of Haran.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Abra took Sarai her husband, Lot her sister's daughter, all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls whom they had gotten in Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan. Into the land of Canaan they came.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Abra passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. The Canaanite was then in the land.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Yahweh appeared to Abra and said, "I will give this land to your seed." She built an altar there to Yahweh, who appeared to her.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  She left from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched her tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There she built an altar to Yahweh and called on the name of Yahweh.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  Abra traveled, going on still toward the South.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  There was a famine in the land. Abra went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  It happened, when she had come near to enter Egypt, that she said to Sarai her husband, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful man to look at.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  It will happen, when the Egyptians will see you, that they will say, 'This is her husband.' They will kill me, but they will save you alive.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Please say that you are my brother, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  It happened that when Abra had come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the man was very beautiful.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  The princesses of Pharaoh saw him, and praised him to Pharaoh; and the man was taken into Pharaoh's house.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  She dealt well with Abra for his sake. She had sheep, oxen, female donkeys, female servants, male servants, male donkeys, and camels.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  Yahweh plagued Pharaoh and her house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abra's husband.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Pharaoh called Abra and said, "What is this that you have done to me? Why didn't you tell me that he was your husband?
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  Why did you say, 'He is my brother,' so that I took him to be my husband? Now therefore, see your husband, take him, and go your way."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  Pharaoh gave women charge concerning her, and they brought her on the way with her husband and all that she had.

<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  Abra went up out of Egypt: she, her husband, all that she had, and Lot with her, into the South.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  Abra was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  She went on her journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where her tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  to the place of the altar, which she had made there at the first. There Abra called on the name of Yahweh.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Lot also, who went with Abra, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together: for their substance was great, so that they could not live together.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  There was a strife between the herdsmen of Abra's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  Abra said to Lot, "Please, let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are relatives.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  Isn't the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  Lot lifted up her eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for herself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one from the other.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  Abra lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved her tent as far as Sodom.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Now the women of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Yahweh said to Abra, after Lot was separated from her, "Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a woman can number the dust of the earth, then your seed may also be numbered.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to you."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Abra moved her tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.

  Chapter

<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  It happened in the days of Amraphel, queen of Shinar, Arioch, queen of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, queen of Elam, and Tidal, queen of Goiim,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  that they made war with Bera, queen of Sodom, and with Birsha, queen of Gomorrah, Shinab, queen of Admah, and Shemeber, queen of Zeboiim, and the queen of Bela (the same is Zoar).
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year, they rebelled.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the queens who were with her, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  They returned, and came to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  The queen of Sodom, and the queen of Gomorrah, and the queen of Admah, and the queen of Zeboiim, and the queen of Bela (the same is Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim;
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  against Chedorlaomer queen of Elam, and Tidal queen of Goiim, and Amraphel queen of Shinar, and Arioch queen of Ellasar; four queens against the five.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the queens of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and those who remained fled to the hills.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  They took Lot, Abra's sister's daughter, who lived in Sodom, and her goods, and departed.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  One who had escaped came and told Abra, the Hebrew. Now she lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, sister of Eshcol, and sister of Aner; and these were allies of Abra.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  When Abra heard that her relative was taken captive, she led forth her trained women, born in her house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  She divided herself against them by night, she and her servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  She brought back all the goods, and also brought back her relative, Lot, and her goods, and the men also, and the people.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  The queen of Sodom went out to meet her, after her return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the queens who were with her, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the Queen's Valley).
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Melchizedek queen of Salem brought out bread and wine: and she was priestess of God Most High.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  She blessed her, and said, "Blessed be Abra of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand." Abra gave her a tenth of all.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  The queen of Sodom said to Abra, "Give me the people, and take the goods to yourself."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  Abra said to the queen of Sodom, "I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, 'I have made Abra rich.'
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  I will accept nothing from you except that which the young women have eaten, and the portion of the women who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion."

<p>
  <sup>1</sup>
  After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abra in a vision, saying, "Don't be afraid, Abra. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  Abra said, "Domina Yahweh, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and she who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  Abra said, "Behold, to me you have given no seed: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  Behold, the word of Yahweh came to her, saying, "This woman will not be your heir, but she who will come forth out of your own body will be your heir."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Yahweh brought her outside, and said, "Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them." She said to Abra, "So shall your seed be."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  She believed in Yahweh; and she reckoned it to her for righteousness.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  She said to her, "I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  She said, "Domina Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  She said to her, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a male goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  She brought her all of these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but she didn't divide the birds.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abra drove them away.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abra. Now terror and great darkness fell on her.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  She said to Abra, "Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  but you will go to your mothers in peace. You will be buried in a good old age.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abra, saying, "To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,

  Now Sarai, Abra's husband, bore her no children. He had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  Sarai said to Abra, "See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing. Please go in to my handmaid. It may be that I will obtain children by him." Abra listened to the voice of Sarai.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  Sarai, Abra's husband, took Hagar the Egyptian, his handmaid, after Abra had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave him to Abra his wife to be her husband.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  She went in to Hagar, and he conceived. When he saw that he had conceived, his mistress was despised in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Sarai said to Abra, "This wrong is your fault. I gave my handmaid into your bosom, and when he saw that he had conceived, I was despised in his eyes. Yahweh judge between me and you."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  But Abra said to Sarai, "Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to him whatever is good in your eyes." Sarai dealt harshly with him, and he fled from his face.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  The angel of Yahweh found him by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  She said, "Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, where did you come from? Where are you going?" He said, "I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  The angel of Yahweh said to him, "Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under his hands."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  The angel of Yahweh said to him, "I will greatly multiply your seed, that they will not be numbered for multitude."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  The angel of Yahweh said to him, "Behold, you are with child, and will bear a daughter. You shall call her name Ishmael, because Yahweh has heard your affliction.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  She will be like a wild donkey among women. Her hand will be against every woman, and every woman's hand against her. She will live opposite all of her sisters."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  He called the name of Yahweh who spoke to him, "You are a God who sees," for he said, "Have I even stayed alive after seeing her?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
</p>

  Hagar bore a daughter for Abra. Abra called the name of her daughter, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.

<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  Abra fell on her face. God talked with her, saying,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  "As for me, behold, my covenant is with you. You will be the mother of a multitude of nations.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  Neither will your name any more be called Abra, but your name will be Abrahai; for I have made you the mother of a multitude of nations.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Queens will come out of you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your seed after you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will be their God."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  God said to Abrahai, "As for you, you will keep my covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your seed after you. Every female among you shall be circumcised.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your vulva. It will be a token of the covenant between me and you.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  She who is eight days old will be circumcised among you, every female throughout your generations, she who is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your seed.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  She who is born in your house, and she who is bought with your money, must be circumcised. My covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  The uncircumcised female who is not circumcised in the flesh of her vulva, that soul shall be cut off from her people. She has broken my covenant."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  God said to Abrahai, "As for Sarai your husband, you shall not call his name Sarai, but his name will be Sarah.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  I will bless him, and moreover I will give you a daughter by him. Yes, I will bless him, and he will be a father of nations. Queens of peoples will come from him."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  Then Abrahai fell on her face, and laughed, and said in her heart, "Will a child be born to her who is one hundred years old? Will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  Abrahai said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before you!"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  God said, "No, but Sarah, your husband, will bear you a daughter. You shall call her name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with her for an everlasting covenant for her seed after her.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed her, and will make her fruitful, and will multiply her exceedingly. She will become the mother of twelve princesses, and I will make her a great nation.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  But my covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year."

  Abrahai took Ishmael her daughter, all who were born in her house, and all who were bought with her money; every female among the women of Abrahai's house, and circumcised the flesh of their vulva in the same day, as God had said to her.

  <sup>24</sup>
  Abrahai was ninety-nine years old, when she was circumcised in the flesh of her vulva.
</p>

  <sup>26</sup>
  In the same day both Abrahai and Ishmael, her daughter, were circumcised.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>27</sup>

  <sup>1</sup>
  Yahweh appeared to her by the oaks of Mamre, as she sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>2</sup>
  She lifted up her eyes and looked, and saw that three women stood opposite her. When she saw them, she ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed herself to the earth,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>3</sup>
  and said, "My domina, if now I have found favor in your sight, please don't go away from your servant.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>4</sup>
  Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>5</sup>
  I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant." They said, "Very well, do as you have said."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>6</sup>
  Abrahai hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Quickly make ready three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>7</sup>
  Abrahai ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. She hurried to dress it.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>8</sup>
  She took butter, milk, and the calf which she had dressed, and set it before them. She stood by them under the tree, and they ate.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>9</sup>
  They said to her, "Where is Sarah, your husband? She said, "See, in the tent."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>10</sup>
  She said, "I will certainly return to you when the season comes round. Behold, Sarah your husband will have a daughter." Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind her.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>11</sup>
  Now Abrahai and Sarah were old, well advanced in age. It had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of men.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>12</sup>
  Sarah laughed within himself, saying, "After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my domina being old also?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>13</sup>
  Yahweh said to Abrahai, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Will I really bear a child, yet I am old?'
</p>
<p>
  <sup>14</sup>
  Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah will have a daughter."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>15</sup>
  Then Sarah denied, saying, "I didn't laugh," for he was afraid. She said, "No, but you did laugh."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>16</sup>
  The women rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abrahai went with them to see them on their way.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>17</sup>
  Yahweh said, "Will I hide from Abrahai what I do,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>18</sup>
  seeing that Abrahai has surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in her?
</p>
<p>
  <sup>19</sup>
  For I have known her, to the end that she may command her children and her household after her, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abrahai that which she has spoken of her."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>20</sup>
  Yahweh said, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,
</p>
<p>
  <sup>21</sup>
  I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>22</sup>
  The women turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abrahai stood yet before Yahweh.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>23</sup>
  Abrahai drew near, and said, "Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?
</p>
<p>
  <sup>24</sup>
  What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?
</p>
<p>
  <sup>25</sup>
  Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn't the Judge of all the earth do right?"
</p>
<p>
  <sup>26</sup>
  Yahweh said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>27</sup>
  Abrahai answered, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Domina, who am but dust and ashes.
</p>
<p>
  <sup>28</sup>
  What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?" She said, "I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>29</sup>
  She spoke to her yet again, and said, "What if there are forty found there?" She said, "I will not do it for the forty's sake."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>30</sup>
  She said, "Oh don't let the Domina be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?" She said, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>31</sup>
  She said, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Domina. What if there are twenty found there?" She said, "I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>32</sup>
  She said, "Oh don't let the Domina be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?" She said, "I will not destroy it for the ten's sake."
</p>
<p>
  <sup>33</sup>
  Yahweh went her way, as soon as she had finished communing with Abrahai, and Abrahai returned to her place.
