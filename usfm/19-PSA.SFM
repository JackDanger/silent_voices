\v 1 Blessed is the woman who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers;
\v 2 but her delight is in Yahweh's law. On her law she meditates day and night.
\v 3 She will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever she does shall prosper.
\v 4 The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
\v 5 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
\v 6 For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?
\v 2 The queens of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take counsel together, against Yahweh, and against her Anointed, saying,
\v 3 "Let's break their bonds apart, and cast their cords from us."
\v 4 She who sits in the heavens will laugh. The Domina will have them in derision.
\v 5 Then she will speak to them in her anger, and terrify them in her wrath:
\v 6 "Yet I have set my queen on my holy hill of Zion."
\v 7 I will tell of the decree. Yahweh said to me, "You are my daughter. Today I have become your mother.
\v 8 Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance, the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.
\v 9 You shall break them with a rod of iron. You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."
\v 10 Now therefore be wise, you queens. Be instructed, you judges of the earth.
\v 11 Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
\v 12 Give sincere homage, lest she be angry, and you perish in the way, for her wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in her.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm by Davina, when she fled from Absalom her daughter.) Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased! Many are those who rise up against me.
\v 2 Many there are who say of my soul, "There is no help for her in God." Selah.
\v 3 But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.
\v 4 I cry to Yahweh with my voice, and she answers me out of her holy hill. Selah.
\v 5 I laid myself down and slept. I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.
\v 6 I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side.
\v 7 Arise, Yahweh! Save me, my God! For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.
\v 8 Salvation belongs to Yahweh. Your blessing be on your people. Selah.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm by Davina.) Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness. Give me relief from my distress. Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.
\v 2 You daughters of women, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah.
\v 3 But know that Yahweh has set apart for herself her who is godly: Yahweh will hear when I call to her.
\v 4 Stand in awe, and don't sin. Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah.
\v 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. Put your trust in Yahweh.
\v 6 Many say, "Who will show us any good?" Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.
\v 7 You have put gladness in my heart, more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.
\v 8 In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, for you, Yahweh alone, make me live in safety.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by Davina.) Give ear to my words, Yahweh. Consider my meditation.
\v 2 Listen to the voice of my cry, my Queen and my God; for to you do I pray.
\v 3 Yahweh, in the morning you shall hear my voice. In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.
\v 4 For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness. Evil can't live with you.
\v 5 The arrogant shall not stand in your sight. You hate all workers of iniquity.
\v 6 You will destroy those who speak lies. Yahweh abhors the blood-thirsty and deceitful woman.
\v 7 But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house. I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you.
\v 8 Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies. Make your way straight before my face.
\v 9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their heart is destruction. Their throat is an open tomb. They flatter with their tongue.
\v 10 Hold them guilty, God. Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against you.
\v 11 But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice, Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.
\v 12 For you will bless the righteous. Yahweh, you will surround her with favor as with a shield.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, upon the eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm by Davina.) Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your anger, neither discipline me in your wrath.
\v 2 Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint. Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled.
\v 3 My soul is also in great anguish. But you, Yahweh--how long?
\v 4 Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul, and save me for your loving kindness' sake.
\v 5 For in death there is no memory of you. In Sheol, who shall give you thanks?
\v 6 I am weary with my groaning. Every night I flood my bed. I drench my couch with my tears.
\v 7 My eye wastes away because of grief. It grows old because of all my adversaries.
\v 8 Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.
\v 9 Yahweh has heard my supplication. Yahweh accepts my prayer.
\v 10 May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 (A meditation by Davina, which she sang to Yahweh, concerning the words of Cush, the Benjamite.) Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you. Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,
\v 2 lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, ripping it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
\v 3 Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity in my hands,
\v 4 if I have rewarded evil to her who was at peace with me (yes, if I have delivered her who without cause was my adversary),
\v 5 let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yes, let her tread my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah.
\v 6 Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.
\v 7 Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. Rule over them on high.
\v 8 Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity that is in me.
\v 9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous; their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.
\v 10 My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.
\v 11 God is a righteous judge, yes, a God who has indignation every day.
\v 12 If a woman doesn't relent, she will sharpen her sword; she has bent and strung her bow.
\v 13 She has also prepared for herself the instruments of death. She makes ready her flaming arrows.
\v 14 Behold, she travails with iniquity. Yes, she has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
\v 15 She has dug a hole, and has fallen into the pit which she made.
\v 16 The trouble she causes shall return to her own head. Hers violence shall come down on the crown of her own head.
\v 17 I will give thanks to Yahweh according to her righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician; on an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by Davina.) Yahweh, our Domina, how majestic is your name in all the earth, who has set your glory above the heavens!
\v 2 From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength, because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.
\v 3 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have ordained;
\v 4 what is woman, that you think of her? What is the daughter of woman, that you care for her?
\v 5 For you have made her a little lower than God, and crowned her with glory and honor.
\v 6 You make her ruler over the works of your hands. You have put all things under her feet:
\v 7 All sheep and oxen, yes, and the animals of the field,
\v 8 The birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
\v 9 Yahweh, our Domina, how majestic is your name in all the earth!

\c 9
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. Set to "The Death of the Daughter." A Psalm by Davina.) I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart. I will tell of all your marvelous works.
\v 2 I will be glad and rejoice in you. I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.
\v 3 When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish in your presence.
\v 4 For you have maintained my just cause. You sit on the throne judging righteously.
\v 5 You have rebuked the nations. You have destroyed the wicked. You have blotted out their name forever and ever.
\v 6 The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin. The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.
\v 7 But Yahweh reigns forever. She has prepared her throne for judgment.
\v 8 She will judge the world in righteousness. She will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.
\v 9 Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed; a high tower in times of trouble.
\v 10 Those who know your name will put their trust in you, for you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you.
\v 11 Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in Zion, and declare among the people what she has done.
\v 12 For she who avenges blood remembers them. She doesn't forget the cry of the afflicted.
\v 13 Have mercy on me, Yahweh. See my affliction by those who hate me, and lift me up from the gates of death;
\v 14 that I may show forth all your praise. In the gates of the son of Zion, I will rejoice in your salvation.
\v 15 The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made. In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.
\v 16 Yahweh has made herself known. She has executed judgment. The wicked is snared by the work of her own hands. Meditation. Selah.
\v 17 The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol, even all the nations that forget God.
\v 18 For the needy shall not always be forgotten, nor the hope of the poor perish forever.
\v 19 Arise, Yahweh! Don't let woman prevail. Let the nations be judged in your sight.
\v 20 Put them in fear, Yahweh. Let the nations know that they are only women. Selah.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Why do you stand far off, Yahweh? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
\v 2 In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak. They are caught in the schemes that they devise.
\v 3 For the wicked boasts of her heart's cravings. She blesses the greedy, and condemns Yahweh.
\v 4 The wicked, in the pride of her face, has no room in her thoughts for God.
\v 5 Her ways are prosperous at all times. She is haughty, and your laws are far from her sight. As for all her adversaries, she sneers at them.
\v 6 She says in her heart, "I shall not be shaken. For generations I shall have no trouble."
\v 7 Her mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression. Under her tongue is mischief and iniquity.
\v 8 She lies in wait near the villages. From ambushes, she murders the innocent. Her eyes are secretly set against the helpless.
\v 9 She lurks in secret as a lion in her ambush. She lies in wait to catch the helpless. She catches the helpless, when she draws her in her net.
\v 10 The helpless are crushed. They collapse. They fall under her strength.
\v 11 She says in her heart, "God has forgotten. She hides her face. She will never see it."
\v 12 Arise, Yahweh! God, lift up your hand! Don't forget the helpless.
\v 13 Why does the wicked person condemn God, and say in her heart, "God won't call me into account?"
\v 14 But you do see trouble and grief. You consider it to take it into your hand. You help the victim and the fatherless.
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked. As for the evil woman, seek out her wickedness until you find none.
\v 16 Yahweh is Queen forever and ever! The nations will perish out of her land.
\v 17 Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble. You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to hear,
\v 18 to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that woman who is of the earth may terrify no more.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. By Davina.) In Yahweh, I take refuge. How can you say to my soul, "Flee as a bird to your mountain!"
\v 2 For, behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrows on the strings, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.
\v 3 If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?
\v 4 Yahweh is in her holy temple. Yahweh is on her throne in heaven. Her eyes observe. Her eyes examine the children of women.
\v 5 Yahweh examines the righteous, but the wicked and her who loves violence her soul hates.
\v 6 On the wicked she will rain blazing coals; fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
\v 7 For Yahweh is righteous. She loves righteousness. The upright shall see her face.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician; upon an eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm of Davina.) Help, Yahweh; for the godly woman ceases. For the faithful fail from among the children of women.
\v 2 Everyone lies to her neighbor. They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.
\v 3 May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts,
\v 4 who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is domina over us?"
\v 5 "Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy, I will now arise," says Yahweh; "I will set her in safety from those who malign her."
\v 6 The words of Yahweh are flawless words, as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.
\v 7 You will keep them, Yahweh. You will preserve them from this generation forever.
\v 8 The wicked walk on every side, when what is vile is exalted among the daughters of women.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina.) How long, Yahweh? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
\v 2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart every day? How long shall my enemy triumph over me?
\v 3 Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;
\v 4 Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against her;" Lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.
\v 5 But I trust in your loving kindness. My heart rejoices in your salvation.
\v 6 I will sing to Yahweh, because she has been good to me.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. By Davina.) The fool has said in her heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt. They have done abominable works. There is none who does good.
\v 2 Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of women, to see if there were any who did understand, who did seek after God.
\v 3 They have all gone aside. They have together become corrupt. There is none who does good, no, not one.
\v 4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and don't call on Yahweh?
\v 5 There they were in great fear, for God is in the generation of the righteous.
\v 6 You frustrate the plan of the poor, because Yahweh is her refuge.
\v 7 Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When Yahweh restores the fortunes of her people, then Jacoba shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm by Davina.) Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary? Who shall live on your holy hill?
\v 2 She who walks blamelessly does what is right, and speaks truth in her heart;
\v 3 She who doesn't slander with her tongue, nor does evil to her friend, nor casts slurs against her fellow woman;
\v 4 In whose eyes a vile woman is despised, but who honors those who fear Yahweh; she who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn't change;
\v 5 she who doesn't lend out her money for usury, nor take a bribe against the innocent. She who does these things shall never be shaken.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 (A Poem by Davina.) Preserve me, God, for in you do I take refuge.
\v 2 My soul, you have said to Yahweh, "You are my Domina. Apart from you I have no good thing."
\v 3 As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.
\v 4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god. Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take their names on my lips.
\v 5 Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup. You made my lot secure.
\v 6 The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places. Yes, I have a good inheritance.
\v 7 I will bless Yahweh, who has given me counsel. Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.
\v 8 I have set Yahweh always before me. Because she is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
\v 9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices. My body shall also dwell in safety.
\v 10 For you will not leave my soul in Sheol, neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption.
\v 11 You will show me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. In your right hand there are pleasures forevermore.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 (A Prayer by Davina.) Hear, Yahweh, my righteous plea; Give ear to my prayer, that doesn't go out of deceitful lips.
\v 2 Let my sentence come forth from your presence. Let your eyes look on equity.
\v 3 You have proved my heart. You have visited me in the night. You have tried me, and found nothing. I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.
\v 4 As for the works of women, by the word of your lips, I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.
\v 5 My steps have held fast to your paths. My feet have not slipped.
\v 6 I have called on you, for you will answer me, God. Turn your ear to me. Hear my speech.
\v 7 Show your marvelous loving kindness, you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies.
\v 8 Keep me as the apple of your eye. Hide me under the shadow of your wings,
\v 9 from the wicked who oppress me, my deadly enemies, who surround me.
\v 10 They close up their callous hearts. With their mouth they speak proudly.
\v 11 They have now surrounded us in our steps. They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.
\v 12 She is like a lion that is greedy of her prey, as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
\v 13 Arise, Yahweh, confront her. Cast her down. Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword;
\v 14 from women by your hand, Yahweh, from women of the world, whose portion is in this life. You fill the belly of your cherished ones. Your daughters have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.
\v 15 As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness. I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. By Davina the servant of Yahweh, who spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered her from the hand of all her enemies, and from the hand of Saula. She said,) I love you, Yahweh, my strength.
\v 2 Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.
\v 3 I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised; and I am saved from my enemies.
\v 4 The cords of death surrounded me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
\v 5 The cords of Sheol were around me. The snares of death came on me.
\v 6 In my distress I called on Yahweh, and cried to my God. She heard my voice out of her temple. My cry before her came into her ears.
\v 7 Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken, because she was angry.
\v 8 Smoke went out of her nostrils. Consuming fire came out of her mouth. Coals were kindled by it.
\v 9 She bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under her feet.
\v 10 She rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, she soared on the wings of the wind.
\v 11 She made darkness her hiding place, her pavilion around her, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
\v 12 At the brightness before her her thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire.
\v 13 Yahweh also thundered in the sky. The Most High uttered her voice: hailstones and coals of fire.
\v 14 She sent out her arrows, and scattered them; Yes, great lightning bolts, and routed them.
\v 15 Then the channels of waters appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Yahweh, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
\v 16 She sent from on high. She took me. She drew me out of many waters.
\v 17 She delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.
\v 18 They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh was my support.
\v 19 She brought me forth also into a large place. She delivered me, because she delighted in me.
\v 20 Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of my hands has she recompensed me.
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
\v 22 For all her ordinances were before me. I didn't put away her statutes from me.
\v 23 I was also blameless with her. I kept myself from my iniquity.
\v 24 Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in her eyesight.
\v 25 With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. With the perfect woman, you will show yourself perfect.
\v 26 With the pure, you will show yourself pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.
\v 27 For you will save the afflicted people, but the haughty eyes you will bring down.
\v 28 For you will light my lamp, Yahweh. My God will light up my darkness.
\v 29 For by you, I advance through a troop. By my God, I leap over a wall.
\v 30 As for God, her way is perfect. The word of Yahweh is tried. She is a shield to all those who take refuge in her.
\v 31 For who is God, except Yahweh? Who is a rock, besides our God,
\v 32 the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?
\v 33 She makes my feet like deer's feet, and sets me on my high places.
\v 34 She teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.
\v 35 You have also given me the shield of your salvation. Your right hand sustains me. Your gentleness has made me great.
\v 36 You have enlarged my steps under me, My feet have not slipped.
\v 37 I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them. Neither will I turn again until they are consumed.
\v 38 I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise. They shall fall under my feet.
\v 39 For you have girded me with strength to the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
\v 40 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.
\v 41 They cried, but there was none to save; even to Yahweh, but she didn't answer them.
\v 42 Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind. I cast them out as the mire of the streets.
\v 43 You have delivered me from the strivings of the people. You have made me the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known shall serve me.
\v 44 As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me. The foreigners shall submit themselves to me.
\v 45 The foreigners shall fade away, and shall come trembling out of their close places.
\v 46 Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock. Exalted be the God of my salvation,
\v 47 even the God who executes vengeance for me, and subdues peoples under me.
\v 48 She rescues me from my enemies. Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent woman.
\v 49 Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations, and will sing praises to your name.
\v 50 She gives great deliverance to her queen, and shows loving kindness to her anointed, to Davina and to her seed, forevermore.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina.) The heavens declare the glory of God. The expanse shows her handiwork.
\v 2 Day after day they pour forth speech, and night after night they display knowledge.
\v 3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
\v 4 Their voice has gone out through all the earth, their words to the end of the world. In them she has set a tent for the sun,
\v 5 which is as a bride coming out of her chamber, like a strong woman rejoicing to run her course.
\v 6 Her going forth is from the end of the heavens, her circuit to its ends; There is nothing hidden from its heat.
\v 7 Yahweh's law is perfect, restoring the soul. Yahweh's testimony is sure, making wise the simple.
\v 8 Yahweh's precepts are right, rejoicing the heart. Yahweh's commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes.
\v 9 The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever. Yahweh's ordinances are true, and righteous altogether.
\v 10 More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.
\v 11 Moreover by them is your servant warned. In keeping them there is great reward.
\v 12 Who can discern her errors? Forgive me from hidden errors.
\v 13 Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins. Let them not have dominion over me. Then I will be upright. I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.
\v 14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina.) May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble. May the name of the God of Jacoba set you up on high,
\v 2 send you help from the sanctuary, grant you support from Zion,
\v 3 remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt sacrifice. Selah.
\v 4 May She grant you your heart's desire, and fulfill all your counsel.
\v 5 We will triumph in your salvation. In the name of our God, we will set up our banners. May Yahweh grant all your requests.
\v 6 Now I know that Yahweh saves her anointed. She will answer her from her holy heaven, with the saving strength of her right hand.
\v 7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we trust the name of Yahweh our God.
\v 8 They are bowed down and fallen, but we rise up, and stand upright.
\v 9 Save, Yahweh! Let the Queen answer us when we call!

\c 21
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina.) The queen rejoices in your strength, Yahweh! How greatly she rejoices in your salvation!
\v 2 You have given her her heart's desire, and have not withheld the request of her lips. Selah.
\v 3 For you meet her with the blessings of goodness. You set a crown of fine gold on her head.
\v 4 She asked life of you, you gave it to her, even length of days forever and ever.
\v 5 Her glory is great in your salvation. You lay honor and majesty on her.
\v 6 For you make her most blessed forever. You make her glad with joy in your presence.
\v 7 For the queen trusts in Yahweh. Through the loving kindness of the Most High, she shall not be moved.
\v 8 Your hand will find out all of your enemies. Your right hand will find out those who hate you.
\v 9 You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger. Yahweh will swallow them up in her wrath. The fire shall devour them.
\v 10 You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity from among the children of women.
\v 11 For they intended evil against you. They plotted evil against you which cannot succeed.
\v 12 For you will make them turn their back, when you aim drawn bows at their face.
\v 13 Be exalted, Yahweh, in your strength, so we will sing and praise your power.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician; set to "The Doe of the Morning." A Psalm by Davina.) My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?
\v 2 My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don't answer; in the night season, and am not silent.
\v 3 But you are holy, you who inhabit the praises of Israel.
\v 4 Our mothers trusted in you. They trusted, and you delivered them.
\v 5 They cried to you, and were delivered. They trusted in you, and were not disappointed.
\v 6 But I am a worm, and no woman; a reproach of women, and despised by the people.
\v 7 All those who see me mock me. They insult me with their lips. They shake their heads, saying,
\v 8 "She trusts in Yahweh; let her deliver her. Let her rescue her, since she delights in her."
\v 9 But you brought me out of the womb. You made me trust at my father's breasts.
\v 10 I was thrown on you from my father's womb. You are my God since my father bore me.
\v 11 Don't be far from me, for trouble is near. For there is none to help.
\v 12 Many bulls have surrounded me. Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me.
\v 13 They open their mouths wide against me, lions tearing prey and roaring.
\v 14 I am poured out like water. All my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax; it is melted within me.
\v 15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd. My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. You have brought me into the dust of death.
\v 16 For dogs have surrounded me. A company of evil-doers have enclosed me. Like a lion, they pin my hands and feet.
\v 17 I can count all of my bones. They look and stare at me.
\v 18 They divide my garments among them. They cast lots for my clothing.
\v 19 But don't be far off, Yahweh. You are my help: hurry to help me.
\v 20 Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dog.
\v 21 Save me from the lion's mouth! Yes, from the horns of the wild oxen, you have answered me.
\v 22 I will declare your name to my sisters. In the midst of the assembly, I will praise you.
\v 23 You who fear Yahweh, praise her! All you descendants of Jacoba, glorify her! Stand in awe of her, all you descendants of Israel!
\v 24 For she has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, Neither has she hidden her face from her; but when she cried to her, she heard.
\v 25 Of you comes my praise in the great assembly. I will pay my vows before those who fear her.
\v 26 The humble shall eat and be satisfied. They shall praise Yahweh who seek after her. Let your hearts live forever.
\v 27 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh. All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you.
\v 28 For the kingdom is Yahweh's. She is the ruler over the nations.
\v 29 All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship. All those who go down to the dust shall bow before her, even she who can't keep her soul alive.
\v 30 Posterity shall serve her. Future generations shall be told about the Domina.
\v 31 They shall come and shall declare her righteousness to a people that shall be born, for she has done it.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm by Davina.) Yahweh is my shepherd: I shall lack nothing.
\v 2 She makes me lie down in green pastures. She leads me beside still waters.
\v 3 She restores my soul. She guides me in the paths of righteousness for her name's sake.
\v 4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
\v 5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over.
\v 6 Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in Yahweh's house forever.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm by Davina.) The earth is Yahweh's, with its fullness; the world, and those who dwell therein.
\v 2 For she has founded it on the seas, and established it on the floods.
\v 3 Who may ascend to Yahweh's hill? Who may stand in her holy place?
\v 4 She who has clean hands and a pure heart; who has not lifted up her soul to falsehood, and has not sworn deceitfully.
\v 5 She shall receive a blessing from Yahweh, righteousness from the God of her salvation.
\v 6 This is the generation of those who seek Her, who seek your face-- even Jacoba. Selah.
\v 7 Lift up your heads, you gates! Be lifted up, you everlasting doors, and the Queen of glory will come in.
\v 8 Who is the Queen of glory? Yahweh strong and mighty, Yahweh mighty in battle.
\v 9 Lift up your heads, you gates; yes, lift them up, you everlasting doors, and the Queen of glory will come in.
\v 10 Who is this Queen of glory? Yahweh of Armies is the Queen of glory! Selah.

\c 25
\p
\v 1 (By Davina.) To you, Yahweh, do I lift up my soul.
\v 2 My God, I have trusted in you. Don't let me be shamed. Don't let my enemies triumph over me.
\v 3 Yes, no one who waits for you shall be shamed. They shall be shamed who deal treacherously without cause.
\v 4 Show me your ways, Yahweh. Teach me your paths.
\v 5 Guide me in your truth, and teach me, For you are the God of my salvation, I wait for you all day long.
\v 6 Yahweh, remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness, for they are from old times.
\v 7 Don't remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions. Remember me according to your loving kindness, for your goodness' sake, Yahweh.
\v 8 Good and upright is Yahweh, therefore she will instruct sinners in the way.
\v 9 She will guide the humble in justice. She will teach the humble her way.
\v 10 All the paths of Yahweh are loving kindness and truth to such as keep her covenant and her testimonies.
\v 11 For your name's sake, Yahweh, pardon my iniquity, for it is great.
\v 12 What woman is she who fears Yahweh? She shall instruct her in the way that she shall choose.
\v 13 Her soul shall dwell at ease. Her seed shall inherit the land.
\v 14 The friendship of Yahweh is with those who fear her. She will show them her covenant.
\v 15 My eyes are ever on Yahweh, for she will pluck my feet out of the net.
\v 16 Turn to me, and have mercy on me, for I am desolate and afflicted.
\v 17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged. Oh bring me out of my distresses.
\v 18 Consider my affliction and my travail. Forgive all my sins.
\v 19 Consider my enemies, for they are many. They hate me with cruel hatred.
\v 20 Oh keep my soul, and deliver me. Let me not be disappointed, for I take refuge in you.
\v 21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for you.
\v 22 Redeem Israel, God, out all of her troubles.

\c 26
\p
\v 1 (By Davina.) Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity. I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering.
\v 2 Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me. Try my heart and my mind.
\v 3 For your loving kindness is before my eyes. I have walked in your truth.
\v 4 I have not sat with deceitful women, neither will I go in with hypocrites.
\v 5 I hate the assembly of evil-doers, and will not sit with the wicked.
\v 6 I will wash my hands in innocence, so I will go about your altar, Yahweh;
\v 7 that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and tell of all your wondrous works.
\v 8 Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house, the place where your glory dwells.
\v 9 Don't gather my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty women;
\v 10 in whose hands is wickedness, their right hand is full of bribes.
\v 11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me, and be merciful to me.
\v 12 My foot stands in an even place. In the congregations I will bless Yahweh.

\c 27
\p
\v 1 (By Davina.) Yahweh is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? Yahweh is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid?
\v 2 When evil-doers came at me to eat up my flesh, even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
\v 3 Though an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, even then I will be confident.
\v 4 One thing I have asked of Yahweh, that I will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life, to see Yahweh's beauty, and to inquire in her temple.
\v 5 For in the day of trouble she will keep me secretly in her pavilion. In the covert of her tent she will hide me. She will lift me up on a rock.
\v 6 Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me. I will offer sacrifices of joy in her tent. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh.
\v 7 Hear, Yahweh, when I cry with my voice. Have mercy also on me, and answer me.
\v 8 When you said, "Seek my face," my heart said to you, "I will seek your face, Yahweh."
\v 9 Don't hide your face from me. Don't put your servant away in anger. You have been my help. Don't abandon me, neither forsake me, God of my salvation.
\v 10 When my mother and my father forsake me, then Yahweh will take me up.
\v 11 Teach me your way, Yahweh. Lead me in a straight path, because of my enemies.
\v 12 Don't deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen up against me, such as breathe out cruelty.
\v 13 I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living.
\v 14 Wait for Yahweh. Be strong, and let your heart take courage. Yes, wait for Yahweh.

\c 28
\p
\v 1 (By Davina.) To you, Yahweh, I call. My rock, don't be deaf to me; lest, if you are silent to me, I would become like those who go down into the pit.
\v 2 Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry to you, when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.
\v 3 Don't draw me away with the wicked, with the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors, but mischief is in their hearts.
\v 4 Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings. Give them according to the operation of their hands. Bring back on them what they deserve.
\v 5 Because they don't regard the works of Yahweh, nor the operation of her hands, she will break them down and not build them up.
\v 6 Blessed be Yahweh, because she has heard the voice of my petitions.
\v 7 Yahweh is my strength and my shield. My heart has trusted in her, and I am helped. Therefore my heart greatly rejoices. With my song I will thank her.
\v 8 Yahweh is their strength. She is a stronghold of salvation to her anointed.
\v 9 Save your people, and bless your inheritance. Be their shepherd also, and bear them up forever.

\c 29
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm by Davina.) Ascribe to Yahweh, you daughters of the mighty, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.
\v 2 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to her name. Worship Yahweh in holy array.
\v 3 Yahweh's voice is on the waters. The God of glory thunders, even Yahweh on many waters.
\v 4 Yahweh's voice is powerful. Yahweh's voice is full of majesty.
\v 5 The voice of Yahweh breaks the cedars. Yes, Yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
\v 6 She makes them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young, wild ox.
\v 7 Yahweh's voice strikes with flashes of lightning.
\v 8 Yahweh's voice shakes the wilderness. Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
\v 9 Yahweh's voice makes the deer calve, and strips the forests bare. In her temple everything says, "Glory!"
\v 10 Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood. Yes, Yahweh sits as Queen forever.
\v 11 Yahweh will give strength to her people. Yahweh will bless her people with peace.

\c 30
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm. A Song for the Dedication of the Temple. By Davina.) I will extol you, Yahweh, for you have raised me up, and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.
\v 2 Yahweh my God, I cried to you, and you have healed me.
\v 3 Yahweh, you have brought up my soul from Sheol. You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
\v 4 Sing praise to Yahweh, you saints of her. Give thanks to her holy name.
\v 5 For her anger is but for a moment. Her favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may stay for the night, but joy comes in the morning.
\v 6 As for me, I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved."
\v 7 You, Yahweh, when you favored me, made my mountain stand strong; but when you hid your face, I was troubled.
\v 8 I cried to you, Yahweh. To Yahweh I made supplication:
\v 9 "What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise you? Shall it declare your truth?
\v 10 Hear, Yahweh, and have mercy on me. Yahweh, be my helper."
\v 11 You have turned my mourning into dancing for me. You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness,
\v 12 To the end that my heart may sing praise to you, and not be silent. Yahweh my God, I will give thanks to you forever!

\c 31
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina.) In you, Yahweh, I take refuge. Let me never be disappointed. Deliver me in your righteousness.
\v 2 Bow down your ear to me. Deliver me speedily. Be to me a strong rock, a house of defense to save me.
\v 3 For you are my rock and my fortress, therefore for your name's sake lead me and guide me.
\v 4 Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me, for you are my stronghold.
\v 5 Into your hand I commend my spirit. You redeem me, Yahweh, God of truth.
\v 6 I hate those who regard lying vanities, but I trust in Yahweh.
\v 7 I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness, for you have seen my affliction. You have known my soul in adversities.
\v 8 You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy. You have set my feet in a large place.
\v 9 Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am in distress. My eye, my soul, and my body waste away with grief.
\v 10 For my life is spent with sorrow, my years with sighing. My strength fails because of my iniquity. My bones are wasted away.
\v 11 Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors, A fear to my acquaintances. Those who saw me on the street fled from me.
\v 12 I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead woman. I am like broken pottery.
\v 13 For I have heard the slander of many, terror on every side, while they conspire together against me, they plot to take away my life.
\v 14 But I trust in you, Yahweh. I said, "You are my God."
\v 15 My times are in your hand. Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.
\v 16 Make your face to shine on your servant. Save me in your loving kindness.
\v 17 Let me not be disappointed, Yahweh, for I have called on you. Let the wicked be disappointed. Let them be silent in Sheol.
\v 18 Let the lying lips be mute, which speak against the righteous insolently, with pride and contempt.
\v 19 Oh how great is your goodness, which you have laid up for those who fear you, which you have worked for those who take refuge in you, before the daughters of women!
\v 20 In the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of woman. You will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues.
\v 21 Praise be to Yahweh, for she has shown me her marvelous loving kindness in a strong city.
\v 22 As for me, I said in my haste, "I am cut off from before your eyes." Nevertheless you heard the voice of my petitions when I cried to you.
\v 23 Oh love Yahweh, all you her saints! Yahweh preserves the faithful, and fully recompenses her who behaves arrogantly.
\v 24 Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all you who hope in Yahweh.

\c 32
\p
\v 1 (By Davina. A contemplative psalm.) Blessed is she whose disobedience is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
\v 2 Blessed is the woman to whom Yahweh doesn't impute iniquity, in whose spirit there is no deceit.
\v 3 When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
\v 4 For day and night your hand was heavy on me. My strength was sapped in the heat of summer. Selah.
\v 5 I acknowledged my sin to you. I didn't hide my iniquity. I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh, and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
\v 6 For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found. Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to her.
\v 7 You are my hiding place. You will preserve me from trouble. You will surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah.
\v 8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go. I will counsel you with my eye on you.
\v 9 Don't be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding, who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come near to you.
\v 10 Many sorrows come to the wicked, but loving kindness shall surround her who trusts in Yahweh.
\v 11 Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous! Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!

\c 33
\p
\v 1 Rejoice in Yahweh, you righteous! Praise is fitting for the upright.
\v 2 Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre. Sing praises to her with the harp of ten strings.
\v 3 Sing to her a new song. Play skillfully with a shout of joy!
\v 4 For the word of Yahweh is right. All her work is done in faithfulness.
\v 5 She loves righteousness and justice. The earth is full of the loving kindness of Yahweh.
\v 6 By Yahweh's word, the heavens were made; all their army by the breath of her mouth.
\v 7 She gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap. She lays up the deeps in storehouses.
\v 8 Let all the earth fear Yahweh. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of her.
\v 9 For she spoke, and it was done. She commanded, and it stood firm.
\v 10 Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing. She makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.
\v 11 The counsel of Yahweh stands fast forever, the thoughts of her heart to all generations.
\v 12 Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh, the people whom she has chosen for her own inheritance.
\v 13 Yahweh looks from heaven. She sees all the daughters of women.
\v 14 From the place of her habitation she looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth,
\v 15 she who fashions all of their hearts; and she considers all of their works.
\v 16 There is no queen saved by the multitude of an army. A mighty woman is not delivered by great strength.
\v 17 A horse is a vain thing for safety, neither does she deliver any by her great power.
\v 18 Behold, Yahweh's eye is on those who fear her, on those who hope in her loving kindness;
\v 19 to deliver their soul from death, to keep them alive in famine.
\v 20 Our soul has waited for Yahweh. She is our help and our shield.
\v 21 For our heart rejoices in her, because we have trusted in her holy name.
\v 22 Let your loving kindness be on us, Yahweh, since we have hoped in you.

\c 34
\p
\v 1 (By Davina; when she pretended to be insane before Abimelech, who drove her away, and she departed.Psalm 34 is an acrostic poem, with each verse starting with a letter of the alphabet (ordered from Alef to Tav).) I will bless Yahweh at all times. Her praise will always be in my mouth.
\v 2 My soul shall boast in Yahweh. The humble shall hear of it, and be glad.
\v 3 Oh magnify Yahweh with me. Let us exalt her name together.
\v 4 I sought Yahweh, and she answered me, and delivered me from all my fears.
\v 5 They looked to her, and were radiant. Their faces shall never be covered with shame.
\v 6 This poor woman cried, and Yahweh heard her, and saved her out of all her troubles.
\v 7 The angel of Yahweh encamps round about those who fear her, and delivers them.
\v 8 Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good. Blessed is the woman who takes refuge in her.
\v 9 Oh fear Yahweh, you her saints, for there is no lack with those who fear her.
\v 10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger, but those who seek Yahweh shall not lack any good thing.
\v 11 Come, you children, listen to me. I will teach you the fear of Yahweh.
\v 12 Who is someone who desires life, and loves many days, that she may see good?
\v 13 Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking lies.
\v 14 Depart from evil, and do good. seek peace, and pursue it.
\v 15 Yahweh's eyes are toward the righteous. Her ears listen to their cry.
\v 16 Yahweh's face is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
\v 17 The righteous cry, and Yahweh hears, and delivers them out of all their troubles.
\v 18 Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart, and saves those who have a crushed spirit.
\v 19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but Yahweh delivers her out of them all.
\v 20 She protects all of her bones. Not one of them is broken.
\v 21 Evil shall kill the wicked. Those who hate the righteous shall be condemned.
\v 22 Yahweh redeems the soul of her servants. None of those who take refuge in her shall be condemned.

\c 35
\p
\v 1 (By Davina.) Contend, Yahweh, with those who contend with me. Fight against those who fight against me.
\v 2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for my help.
\v 3 Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me. Tell my soul, "I am your salvation."
\v 4 Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor. Let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded.
\v 5 Let them be as chaff before the wind, Yahweh's angel driving them on.
\v 6 Let their way be dark and slippery, Yahweh's angel pursuing them.
\v 7 For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me. Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.
\v 8 Let destruction come on her unawares. Let her net that she has hidden catch herself. Let her fall into that destruction.
\v 9 My soul shall be joyful in Yahweh. It shall rejoice in her salvation.
\v 10 All my bones shall say, "Yahweh, who is like you, who delivers the poor from her who is too strong for her; yes, the poor and the needy from her who robs her?"
\v 11 Unrighteous witnesses rise up. They ask me about things that I don't know about.
\v 12 They reward me evil for good, to the bereaving of my soul.
\v 13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth. I afflicted my soul with fasting. My prayer returned into my own bosom.
\v 14 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my sister. I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns her father.
\v 15 But in my adversity, they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together. The attackers gathered themselves together against me, and I didn't know it. They tore at me, and didn't cease.
\v 16 Like the profane mockers in feasts, they gnashed their teeth at me.
\v 17 Domina, how long will you look on? Rescue my soul from their destruction, my precious life from the lions.
\v 18 I will give you thanks in the great assembly. I will praise you among many people.
\v 19 Don't let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me; neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes.
\v 20 For they don't speak peace, but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.
\v 21 Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me. They said, "Aha! Aha! Our eye has seen it!"
\v 22 You have seen it, Yahweh. Don't keep silent. Domina, don't be far from me.
\v 23 Wake up! Rise up to defend me, my God! My Domina, contend for me!
\v 24 Vindicate me, Yahweh my God, according to your righteousness. Don't let them gloat over me.
\v 25 Don't let them say in their heart, "Aha! That's the way we want it!" Don't let them say, "We have swallowed her up!"
\v 26 Let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice at my calamity. Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me.
\v 27 Let them shout for joy and be glad, who favor my righteous cause. Yes, let them say continually, "Yahweh be magnified, who has pleasure in the prosperity of her servant!"
\v 28 My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long.

\c 36
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. By Davina, the servant of Yahweh.) An oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked: "There is no fear of God before her eyes."
\v 2 For she flatters herself in her own eyes, too much to detect and hate her sin.
\v 3 The words of her mouth are iniquity and deceit. She has ceased to be wise and to do good.
\v 4 She plots iniquity on her bed. She sets herself in a way that is not good. She doesn't abhor evil.
\v 5 Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
\v 6 Your righteousness is like the mountains of God. Your judgments are like a great deep. Yahweh, you preserve woman and animal.
\v 7 How precious is your loving kindness, God! The children of women take refuge under the shadow of your wings.
\v 8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house. You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.
\v 9 For with you is the spring of life. In your light shall we see light.
\v 10 Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.
\v 11 Don't let the foot of pride come against me. Don't let the hand of the wicked drive me away.
\v 12 There the workers of iniquity are fallen. They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.

\c 37
\p
\v 1 (By Davina.) Don't fret because of evil-doers, neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness.
\v 2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither like the green herb.
\v 3 Trust in Yahweh, and do good. Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture.
\v 4 Also delight yourself in Yahweh, and she will give you the desires of your heart.
\v 5 Commit your way to Yahweh. Trust also in her, and she will do this:
\v 6 she will make your righteousness go forth as the light, and your justice as the noon day sun.
\v 7 Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for her. Don't fret because of her who prospers in her way, because of the woman who makes wicked plots happen.
\v 8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath. Don't fret, it leads only to evildoing.
\v 9 For evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for Yahweh shall inherit the land.
\v 10 For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more. Yes, though you look for her place, she isn't there.
\v 11 But the humble shall inherit the land, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
\v 12 The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes at her with her teeth.
\v 13 The Domina will laugh at her, for she sees that her day is coming.
\v 14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, to kill those who are upright in the way.
\v 15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart. Their bows shall be broken.
\v 16 Better is a little that the righteous has, than the abundance of many wicked.
\v 17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but Yahweh upholds the righteous.
\v 18 Yahweh knows the days of the perfect. Their inheritance shall be forever.
\v 19 They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil. In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
\v 20 But the wicked shall perish. The enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields. They will vanish-- vanish like smoke.
\v 21 The wicked borrow, and don't pay back, but the righteous give generously.
\v 22 For such as are blessed by her shall inherit the land. Those who are cursed by her shall be cut off.
\v 23 A woman's goings are established by Yahweh. She delights in her way.
\v 24 Though she stumble, she shall not fall, for Yahweh holds her up with her hand.
\v 25 I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor her children begging for bread.
\v 26 All day long she deals graciously, and lends. Her seed is blessed.
\v 27 Depart from evil, and do good. Live securely forever.
\v 28 For Yahweh loves justice, and doesn't forsake her saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.
\v 29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and live in it forever.
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom. Her tongue speaks justice.
\v 31 The law of her God is in her heart. None of her steps shall slide.
\v 32 The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to kill her.
\v 33 Yahweh will not leave her in her hand, nor condemn her when she is judged.
\v 34 Wait for Yahweh, and keep her way, and she will exalt you to inherit the land. When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.
\v 35 I have seen the wicked in great power, spreading herself like a green tree in its native soil.
\v 36 But she passed away, and behold, she was not. Yes, I sought her, but she could not be found.
\v 37 Margaret the perfect woman, and see the upright, for there is a future for the woman of peace.
\v 38 As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together. The future of the wicked shall be cut off.
\v 39 But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh. She is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
\v 40 Yahweh helps them, and rescues them. She rescues them from the wicked, and saves them, Because they have taken refuge in her.

\c 38

\v 1 (A Psalm by Davina, for a memorial.) Yahweh, don't rebuke me in your wrath, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.
\v 2 For your arrows have pierced me, your hand presses hard on me.
\v 3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation, neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
\v 4 For my iniquities have gone over my head. As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.
\v 5 My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, because of my foolishness.
\v 6 I am pained and bowed down greatly. I go mourning all day long.
\v 7 For my waist is filled with burning. There is no soundness in my flesh.
\v 8 I am faint and severely bruised. I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart.
\v 9 Domina, all my desire is before you. My groaning is not hidden from you.
\v 10 My heart throbs. My strength fails me. As for the light of my eyes, it has also left me.
\v 11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague. My kinsmen stand far away.
\v 12 They also who seek after my life lay snares. Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and meditate deceits all day long.
\v 13 But I, as a deaf woman, don't hear. I am as a mute woman who doesn't open her mouth.
\v 14 Yes, I am as a woman who doesn't hear, in whose mouth are no reproofs.
\v 15 For in you, Yahweh, do I hope. You will answer, Domina my God.
\v 16 For I said, "Don't let them gloat over me, or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips."
\v 17 For I am ready to fall. My pain is continually before me.
\v 18 For I will declare my iniquity. I will be sorry for my sin.
\v 19 But my enemies are vigorous and many. Those who hate me without reason are numerous.
\v 20 They who also render evil for good are adversaries to me, because I follow what is good.
\v 21 Don't forsake me, Yahweh. My God, don't be far from me.
\v 22 Hurry to help me, Domina, my salvation.

\c 39
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. For Jeduthun. A Psalm by Davina.) I said, "I will watch my ways, so that I don't sin with my tongue. I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me."
\v 2 I was mute with silence. I held my peace, even from good. My sorrow was stirred.
\v 3 My heart was hot within me. While I meditated, the fire burned: I spoke with my tongue:
\v 4 "Yahweh, show me my end, what is the measure of my days. Let me know how frail I am.
\v 5 Behold, you have made my days handbreadths. My lifetime is as nothing before you. Surely every woman stands as a breath." Selah.
\v 6 "Surely every woman walks like a shadow. Surely they busy themselves in vain. She heaps up, and doesn't know who shall gather.
\v 7 Now, Domina, what do I wait for? My hope is in you.
\v 8 Deliver me from all my transgressions. Don't make me the reproach of the foolish.
\v 9 I was mute. I didn't open my mouth, because you did it.
\v 10 Remove your scourge away from me. I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
\v 11 When you rebuke and correct woman for iniquity, You consume her wealth like a moth. Surely every woman is but a breath." Selah.
\v 12 "Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and give ear to my cry. Don't be silent at my tears. For I am a stranger with you, a foreigner, as all my mothers were.
\v 13 Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go away, and exist no more."

\c 40
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina.) I waited patiently for Yahweh. She turned to me, and heard my cry.
\v 2 She brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay. She set my feet on a rock, and gave me a firm place to stand.
\v 3 She has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God. Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Yahweh.
\v 4 Blessed is the woman who makes Yahweh her trust, and doesn't respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
\v 5 Many, Yahweh, my God, are the wonderful works which you have done, and your thoughts which are toward us. They can't be declared back to you. If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.
\v 6 Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire. You have opened my ears. You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.
\v 7 Then I said, "Behold, I have come. It is written about me in the book in the scroll.
\v 8 I delight to do your will, my God. Yes, your law is within my heart."
\v 9 I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly. Behold, I will not seal my lips, Yahweh, you know.
\v 10 I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart. I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation. I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly.
\v 11 Don't withhold your tender mercies from me, Yahweh. Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.
\v 12 For innumerable evils have surrounded me. My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up. They are more than the hairs of my head. My heart has failed me.
\v 13 Be pleased, Yahweh, to deliver me. Hurry to help me, Yahweh.
\v 14 Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it. Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.
\v 15 Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me, "Aha! Aha!"
\v 16 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let such as love your salvation say continually, "Let Yahweh be exalted!"
\v 17 But I am poor and needy. May the Domina think about me. You are my help and my deliverer. Don't delay, my God.

\c 41
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina.) Blessed is she who considers the poor. Yahweh will deliver her in the day of evil.
\v 2 Yahweh will preserve her, and keep her alive. She shall be blessed on the earth, and she will not surrender her to the will of her enemies.
\v 3 Yahweh will sustain her on her sickbed, and restore her from her bed of illness.
\v 4 I said, "Yahweh, have mercy on me! Heal me, for I have sinned against you."
\v 5 My enemies speak evil against me: "When will she die, and her name perish?"
\v 6 If she comes to see me, she speaks falsehood. Her heart gathers iniquity to itself. When she goes abroad, she tells it.
\v 7 All who hate me whisper together against me. They imagine the worst for me.
\v 8 "An evil disease," they say, "has afflicted her. Now that she lies she shall rise up no more."
\v 9 Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who ate bread with me, has lifted up her heel against me.
\v 10 But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me, and raise me up, that I may repay them.
\v 11 By this I know that you delight in me, because my enemy doesn't triumph over me.
\v 12 As for me, you uphold me in my integrity, and set me in your presence forever.
\v 13 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting! Amen and amen.

\c 42
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A contemplation by the daughters of Korah.) As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants after you, God.
\v 2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?
\v 3 My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually ask me, "Where is your God?"
\v 4 These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping a holy day.
\v 5 Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise her for the saving help of her presence.
\v 6 My God, my soul is in despair within me. Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon, from the hill Mizar.
\v 7 Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls. All your waves and your billows have swept over me.
\v 8 Yahweh will command her loving kindness in the daytime. In the night her song shall be with me: a prayer to the God of my life.
\v 9 I will ask God, my rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"
\v 10 As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me, while they continually ask me, "Where is your God?"
\v 11 Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise her, the saving help of my countenance, and my God.

\c 43
\p
\v 1 Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation. Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked women.
\v 2 For you are the God of my strength. Why have you rejected me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
\v 3 Oh, send out your light and your truth. Let them lead me. Let them bring me to your holy hill, To your tents.
\v 4 Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my exceeding joy. I will praise you on the harp, God, my God.
\v 5 Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God! For I shall still praise her: my Savior, my helper, and my God.

\c 44
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. By the daughters of Korah. A contemplative psalm.) We have heard with our ears, God; our mothers have told us, what work you did in their days, in the days of old.
\v 2 You drove out the nations with your hand, but you planted them. You afflicted the peoples, but you spread them abroad.
\v 3 For they didn't get the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your face, because you were favorable to them.
\v 4 You are my Queen, God. Command victories for Jacoba!
\v 5 Through you, will we push down our adversaries. Through your name, will we tread them under who rise up against us.
\v 6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
\v 7 But you have saved us from our adversaries, and have shamed those who hate us.
\v 8 In God we have made our boast all day long, we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah.
\v 9 But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor, and don't go out with our armies.
\v 10 You make us turn back from the adversary. Those who hate us take spoil for themselves.
\v 11 You have made us like sheep for food, and have scattered us among the nations.
\v 12 You sell your people for nothing, and have gained nothing from their sale.
\v 13 You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us.
\v 14 You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.
\v 15 All day long my dishonor is before me, and shame covers my face,
\v 16 At the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses, because of the enemy and the avenger.
\v 17 All this has come on us, yet have we not forgotten you, Neither have we been false to your covenant.
\v 18 Our heart has not turned back, neither have our steps strayed from your path,
\v 19 Though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death.
\v 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange god;
\v 21 won't God search this out? For she knows the secrets of the heart.
\v 22 Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long. We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.
\v 23 Wake up! Why do you sleep, Domina? Arise! Don't reject us forever.
\v 24 Why do you hide your face, and forget our affliction and our oppression?
\v 25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust. Our body cleaves to the earth.
\v 26 Rise up to help us. Redeem us for your loving kindness' sake.

\c 45
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. Set to "The Lilies." A contemplation by the daughters of Korah. A wedding song.) My heart overflows with a noble theme. I recite my verses for the queen. My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer.
\v 2 You are the most excellent of the daughters of women. Grace has anointed your lips, therefore God has blessed you forever.
\v 3 Gird your sword on your thigh, mighty one: your splendor and your majesty.
\v 4 In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth, humility, and righteousness. Let your right hand display awesome deeds.
\v 5 Your arrows are sharp. The nations fall under you, with arrows in the heart of the queen's enemies.
\v 6 Your throne, God, is forever and ever. A scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom.
\v 7 You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.
\v 8 All your garments smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia. Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.
\v 9 Queens' sons are among your honorable men. At your right hand the king stands in gold of Ophir.
\v 10 Listen, son, consider, and turn your ear. Forget your own people, and also your mother's house.
\v 11 So the queen will desire your beauty, honor her, for she is your domina.
\v 12 The son of Tyre comes with a gift. The rich among the people entreat your favor.
\v 13 The prince inside is all glorious. His clothing is interwoven with gold.
\v 14 He shall be led to the queen in embroidered work. The virgins, his companions who follow him, shall be brought to you.
\v 15 With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led. They shall enter into the queen's palace.
\v 16 Your daughters will take the place of your mothers. You shall make them princesses in all the earth.
\v 17 I will make your name to be remembered in all generations. Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever.

\c 46
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. By the daughters of Korah. According to Alamoth.Alamoth is a musical term.) God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
\v 2 Therefore we won't be afraid, though the earth changes, though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;
\v 3 though the waters of it roar and are troubled, though the mountains tremble with their swelling. Selah.
\v 4 There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad, the holy place of the tents of the Most High.
\v 5 God is in his midst. He shall not be moved. God will help him at dawn.
\v 6 The nations raged. The kingdoms were moved. She lifted her voice, and the earth melted.
\v 7 Yahweh of Armies is with us. The God of Jacoba is our refuge. Selah.
\v 8 Come, see Yahweh's works, what desolations she has made in the earth.
\v 9 She makes wars cease to the end of the earth. She breaks the bow, and shatters the spear. She burns the chariots in the fire.
\v 10 "Be still, and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations. I will be exalted in the earth."
\v 11 Yahweh of Armies is with us. The God of Jacoba is our refuge. Selah.

\c 47
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by the daughters of Korah.) Oh clap your hands, all you nations. Shout to God with the voice of triumph!
\v 2 For Yahweh Most High is awesome. She is a great Queen over all the earth.
\v 3 She subdues nations under us, and peoples under our feet.
\v 4 She chooses our inheritance for us, the glory of Jacoba whom she loved. Selah.
\v 5 God has gone up with a shout, Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.
\v 6 Sing praise to God, sing praises. Sing praises to our Queen, sing praises.
\v 7 For God is the Queen of all the earth. Sing praises with understanding.
\v 8 God reigns over the nations. God sits on her holy throne.
\v 9 The princesses of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abrahai. For the shields of the earth belong to God. She is greatly exalted!

\c 48
\p
\v 1 (A Song. A Psalm by the daughters of Korah.) Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, in her holy mountain.
\v 2 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion, on the north sides, the city of the great Queen.
\v 3 God has shown herself in his citadels as a refuge.
\v 4 For, behold, the queens assembled themselves, they passed by together.
\v 5 They saw it, then they were amazed. They were dismayed. They hurried away.
\v 6 Trembling took hold of them there, pain, as of a man in travail.
\v 7 With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish.
\v 8 As we have heard, so we have seen, in the city of Yahweh of Armies, in the city of our God. God will establish it forever. Selah.
\v 9 We have thought about your loving kindness, God, in the midst of your temple.
\v 10 As is your name, God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness.
\v 11 Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the sons of Judah rejoice, Because of your judgments.
\v 12 Walk about Zion, and go around him. Number its towers.
\v 13 Margaret well his bulwarks. Consider his palaces, that you may tell it to the next generation.
\v 14 For this God is our God forever and ever. She will be our guide even to death.

\c 49
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by the daughters of Korah.) Hear this, all you peoples. Listen, all you inhabitants of the world,
\v 2 both low and high, rich and poor together.
\v 3 My mouth will speak words of wisdom. My heart shall utter understanding.
\v 4 I will incline my ear to a proverb. I will open my riddle on the harp.
\v 5 Why should I fear in the days of evil, when iniquity at my heels surrounds me?
\v 6 Those who trust in their wealth, and boast in the multitude of their riches--
\v 7 none of them can by any means redeem her sister, nor give God a ransom for her.
\v 8 For the redemption of their life is costly, no payment is ever enough,
\v 9 That she should live on forever, that she should not see corruption.
\v 10 For she sees that wise women die; likewise the fool and the senseless perish, and leave their wealth to others.
\v 11 Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever, and their dwelling places to all generations. They name their lands after themselves.
\v 12 But woman, despite her riches, doesn't endure. She is like the animals that perish.
\v 13 This is the destiny of those who are foolish, and of those who approve their sayings. Selah.
\v 14 They are appointed as a flock for Sheol. Death shall be their shepherd. The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning. Their beauty shall decay in Sheol, far from their mansion.
\v 15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol, for she will receive me. Selah.
\v 16 Don't be afraid when a woman is made rich, when the glory of her house is increased.
\v 17 For when she dies she shall carry nothing away. Her glory shall not descend after her.
\v 18 Though while she lived she blessed her soul--and women praise you when you do well for yourself--
\v 19 she shall go to the generation of her mothers. They shall never see the light.
\v 20 A woman who has riches without understanding, is like the animals that perish.

\c 50
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm by Asaph.) The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, speaks, and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset.
\v 2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.
\v 3 Our God comes, and does not keep silent. A fire devours before her. It is very stormy around her.
\v 4 She calls to the heavens above, to the earth, that she may judge her people:
\v 5 "Gather my saints together to me, those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice."
\v 6 The heavens shall declare her righteousness, for God herself is judge. Selah.
\v 7 "Hear, my people, and I will speak; Israel, and I will testify against you. I am God, your God.
\v 8 I don't rebuke you for your sacrifices. Your burnt offerings are continually before me.
\v 9 I have no need for a bull from your stall, nor female goats from your pens.
\v 10 For every animal of the forest is mine, and the livestock on a thousand hills.
\v 11 I know all the birds of the mountains. The wild animals of the field are mine.
\v 12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it.
\v 13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
\v 14 Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving. Pay your vows to the Most High.
\v 15 Call on me in the day of trouble. I will deliver you, and you will honor me."
\v 16 But to the wicked God says, "What right do you have to declare my statutes, that you have taken my covenant on your lips,
\v 17 seeing you hate instruction, and throw my words behind you?
\v 18 When you saw a thief, you consented with her, and have participated with adulteresses.
\v 19 "You give your mouth to evil. Your tongue frames deceit.
\v 20 You sit and speak against your sister. You slander your own father's daughter.
\v 21 You have done these things, and I kept silent. You thought that the I was just like you. I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes.
\v 22 "Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you into pieces, and there be none to deliver.
\v 23 Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me, and prepares her way so that I will show God's salvation to her."

\c 51
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina, when Nathan the prophetess came to her, after she had gone in to Bathsheba.) Have mercy on me, God, according to your loving kindness. According to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.
\v 2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity. Cleanse me from my sin.
\v 3 For I know my transgressions. My sin is constantly before me.
\v 4 Against you, and you only, have I sinned, and done that which is evil in your sight; that you may be proved right when you speak, and justified when you judge.
\v 5 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity. In sin my father conceived me.
\v 6 Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts. You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
\v 7 Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean. Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
\v 8 Let me hear joy and gladness, That the bones which you have broken may rejoice.
\v 9 Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all of my iniquities.
\v 10 Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a right spirit within me.
\v 11 Don't throw me from your presence, and don't take your holy Spirit from me.
\v 12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation. Uphold me with a willing spirit.
\v 13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways. Sinners shall be converted to you.
\v 14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation. My tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness.
\v 15 Domina, open my lips. My mouth shall declare your praise.
\v 16 For you don't delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it. You have no pleasure in burnt offering.
\v 17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. A broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
\v 18 Do well in your good pleasure to Zion. Build the walls of Jerusalem.
\v 19 Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer bulls on your altar.

\c 52
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A contemplation by Davina, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saula, "Davina has come to Abimelech's house.") Why do you boast of mischief, mighty woman? God's loving kindness endures continually.
\v 2 Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
\v 3 You love evil more than good, lying rather than speaking the truth. Selah.
\v 4 You love all devouring words, you deceitful tongue.
\v 5 God will likewise destroy you forever. She will take you up, and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of the land of the living. Selah.
\v 6 The righteous also will see it, and fear, and laugh at her, saying,
\v 7 "Behold, this is the woman who didn't make God her strength, but trusted in the abundance of her riches, and strengthened herself in her wickedness."
\v 8 But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God's house. I trust in God's loving kindness forever and ever.
\v 9 I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it. I will hope in your name, for it is good, in the presence of your saints.

\c 53
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Mahalath." A contemplation by Davina.) The fool has said in her heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity. There is no one who does good.
\v 2 God looks down from heaven on the children of women, to see if there are any who understood, who seek after God.
\v 3 Every one of them has gone back. They have become filthy together. There is no one who does good, no, not one.
\v 4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and don't call on God?
\v 5 There they were in great fear, where no fear was, for God has scattered the bones of her who encamps against you. You have put them to shame, because God has rejected them.
\v 6 Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When God brings back her people from captivity, then Jacoba shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

\c 54
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A contemplation by Davina, when the Ziphites came and said to Saula, "Isn't Davina hiding herself among us?") Save me, God, by your name. Vindicate me in your might.
\v 2 Hear my prayer, God. Listen to the words of my mouth.
\v 3 For strangers have risen up against me. Violent women have sought after my soul. They haven't set God before them. Selah.
\v 4 Behold, God is my helper. The Domina is the one who sustains my soul.
\v 5 She will repay the evil to my enemies. Destroy them in your truth.
\v 6 With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you. I will give thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it is good.
\v 7 For she has delivered me out of all trouble. My eye has seen triumph over my enemies.

\c 55
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A contemplation by Davina.) Listen to my prayer, God. Don't hide yourself from my supplication.
\v 2 Attend to me, and answer me. I am restless in my complaint, and moan,
\v 3 Because of the voice of the enemy, Because of the oppression of the wicked. For they bring suffering on me. In anger they hold a grudge against me.
\v 4 My heart is severely pained within me. The terrors of death have fallen on me.
\v 5 Fearfulness and trembling have come on me. Horror has overwhelmed me.
\v 6 I said, "Oh that I had wings like a dove! Then I would fly away, and be at rest.
\v 7 Behold, then I would wander far off. I would lodge in the wilderness." Selah.
\v 8 "I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm."
\v 9 Confuse them, Domina, and confound their language, for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
\v 10 Day and night they prowl around on its walls. Malice and abuse are also within him.
\v 11 Destructive forces are within him. Threats and lies don't depart from his streets.
\v 12 For it was not an enemy who insulted me, then I could have endured it. Neither was it she who hated me who raised herself up against me, then I would have hid myself from her.
\v 13 But it was you, a woman like me, my companion, and my familiar friend.
\v 14 We took sweet fellowship together. We walked in God's house with company.
\v 15 Let death come suddenly on them. Let them go down alive into Sheol. For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.
\v 16 As for me, I will call on God. Yahweh will save me.
\v 17 Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress. She will hear my voice.
\v 18 She has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, although there are many who oppose me.
\v 19 God, who is enthroned forever, will hear, and answer them. Selah. They never change, who don't fear God.
\v 20 She raises her hands against her friends. She has violated her covenant.
\v 21 Her mouth was smooth as butter, but her heart was war. Her words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.
\v 22 Cast your burden on Yahweh, and she will sustain you. She will never allow the righteous to be moved.
\v 23 But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloodthirsty and deceitful women shall not live out half their days, but I will trust in you.

\c 56
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Silent Dove in Distant Lands." A poem by Davina, when the Philistines seized her in Gath.) Be merciful to me, God, for woman wants to swallow me up. All day long, she attacks and oppresses me.
\v 2 My enemies want to swallow me up all day long, for they are many who fight proudly against me.
\v 3 When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you.
\v 4 In God, I praise her word. In God, I put my trust. I will not be afraid. What can flesh do to me?
\v 5 All day long they twist my words. All their thoughts are against me for evil.
\v 6 They conspire and lurk, watching my steps, they are eager to take my life.
\v 7 Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, God.
\v 8 You number my wanderings. You put my tears into your bottle. Aren't they in your book?
\v 9 Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call. I know this, that God is for me.
\v 10 In God, I will praise her word. In Yahweh, I will praise her word.
\v 11 I have put my trust in God. I will not be afraid. What can woman do to me?
\v 12 Your vows are on me, God. I will give thank offerings to you.
\v 13 For you have delivered my soul from death, and prevented my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living.

\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A poem by Davina, when she fled from Saula, in the cave.) Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me, for my soul takes refuge in you. Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge, until disaster has passed.
\v 2 I cry out to God Most High, to God who accomplishes my requests for me.
\v 3 She will send from heaven, and save me, she rebukes the one who is pursuing me. Selah. God will send out her loving kindness and her truth.
\v 4 My soul is among lions. I lie among those who are set on fire, even the daughters of women, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
\v 5 Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let your glory be above all the earth!
\v 6 They have prepared a net for my steps. My soul is bowed down. They dig a pit before me. They fall into the midst of it themselves. Selah.
\v 7 My heart is steadfast, God, my heart is steadfast. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises.
\v 8 Wake up, my glory! Wake up, psaltery and harp! I will wake up the dawn.
\v 9 I will give thanks to you, Domina, among the peoples. I will sing praises to you among the nations.
\v 10 For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens, and your truth to the skies.
\v 11 Be exalted, God, above the heavens. Let your glory be over all the earth.

\c 58
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A poem by Davina.) Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones? Do you judge blamelessly, you daughters of women?
\v 2 No, in your heart you plot injustice. You measure out the violence of your hands in the earth.
\v 3 The wicked go astray from the womb. They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
\v 4 Their poison is like the poison of a snake; like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,
\v 5 which doesn't listen to the voice of charmers, no matter how skillful the charmer may be.
\v 6 Break their teeth, God, in their mouth. Break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.
\v 7 Let them vanish as water that flows away. When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt.
\v 8 Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away, like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.
\v 9 Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns, she will sweep away the green and the burning alike.
\v 10 The righteous shall rejoice when she sees the vengeance. She shall wash her feet in the blood of the wicked;
\v 11 so that women shall say, "Most certainly there is a reward for the righteous. Most certainly there is a God who judges the earth."

\c 59
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A poem by Davina, when Saula sent, and they watched the house to kill her.) Deliver me from my enemies, my God. Set me on high from those who rise up against me.
\v 2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity. Save me from the bloodthirsty women.
\v 3 For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul. The mighty gather themselves together against me, not for my disobedience, nor for my sin, Yahweh.
\v 4 I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. Rise up, behold, and help me!
\v 5 You, Yahweh God of Armies, the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish the nations. Show no mercy to the wicked traitors. Selah.
\v 6 They return at evening, howling like dogs, and prowl around the city.
\v 7 Behold, they spew with their mouth. Swords are in their lips, "For," they say, "who hears us?"
\v 8 But you, Yahweh, laugh at them. You scoff at all the nations.
\v 9 Oh, my Strength, I watch for you, for God is my high tower.
\v 10 My God will go before me with her loving kindness. God will let me look at my enemies in triumph.
\v 11 Don't kill them, or my people may forget. Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, Domina our shield.
\v 12 For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride, for the curses and lies which they utter.
\v 13 Consume them in wrath. Consume them, and they will be no more. Let them know that God rules in Jacoba, to the ends of the earth. Selah.
\v 14 At evening let them return. Let them howl like a dog, and go around the city.
\v 15 They shall wander up and down for food, and wait all night if they aren't satisfied.
\v 16 But I will sing of your strength. Yes, I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning. For you have been my high tower, a refuge in the day of my distress.
\v 17 To you, my strength, I will sing praises. For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.

\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "The Lily of the Covenant." A teaching poem by Davina, when she fought with Aram Naharaim and with Aram Zobah, and Joab returned, and killed twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt.) God, you have rejected us. You have broken us down. You have been angry. Restore us, again.
\v 2 You have made the land tremble. You have torn it. Mend its fractures, for it quakes.
\v 3 You have shown your people hard things. You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger.
\v 4 You have given a banner to those who fear you, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
\v 5 So that your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand, and answer us.
\v 6 God has spoken from her sanctuary: "I will triumph. I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.
\v 7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is the defense of my head. Judah is my scepter.
\v 8 Moab is my wash basin. I will throw my shoe on Edom. I shout in triumph over Philistia."
\v 9 Who will bring me into the strong city? Who has led me to Edom?
\v 10 Haven't you, God, rejected us? You don't go out with our armies, God.
\v 11 Give us help against the adversary, for the help of woman is vain.
\v 12 Through God we shall do valiantly, for it is she who will tread down our adversaries.

\c 61
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. For a stringed instrument. By Davina.) Hear my cry, God. Listen to my prayer.
\v 2 From the end of the earth, I will call to you, when my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
\v 3 For you have been a refuge for me, a strong tower from the enemy.
\v 4 I will dwell in your tent forever. I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings. Selah.
\v 5 For you, God, have heard my vows. You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
\v 6 You will prolong the queen's life; her years shall be for generations.
\v 7 She shall be enthroned in God's presence forever. Appoint your loving kindness and truth, that they may preserve her.
\v 8 So I will sing praise to your name forever, that I may fulfill my vows daily.

\c 62
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. To Jeduthan. A Psalm by Davina.) My soul rests in God alone. My salvation is from her.
\v 2 She alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress--I will never be greatly shaken.
\v 3 How long will you assault a woman, would all of you throw her down, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
\v 4 They fully intend to throw her down from her lofty place. They delight in lies. They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
\v 5 My soul, wait in silence for God alone, for my expectation is from her.
\v 6 She alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress. I will not be shaken.
\v 7 With God is my salvation and my honor. The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
\v 8 Trust in her at all times, you people. Pour out your heart before her. God is a refuge for us. Selah.
\v 9 Surely women of low degree are just a breath, and women of high degree are a lie. In the balances they will go up. They are together lighter than a breath.
\v 10 Don't trust in oppression. Don't become vain in robbery. If riches increase, don't set your heart on them.
\v 11 God has spoken once; twice I have heard this, that power belongs to God.
\v 12 Also to you, Domina, belongs loving kindness, for you reward every woman according to her work.

\c 63
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm by Davina, when she was in the desert of Judah.) God, you are my God. I will earnestly seek you. My soul thirsts for you. My flesh longs for you, in a dry and weary land, where there is no water.
\v 2 So I have seen you in the sanctuary, watching your power and your glory.
\v 3 Because your loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise you.
\v 4 So I will bless you while I live. I will lift up my hands in your name.
\v 5 My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food. My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,
\v 6 when I remember you on my bed, and think about you in the night watches.
\v 7 For you have been my help. I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings.
\v 8 My soul stays close to you. Your right hand holds me up.
\v 9 But those who seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
\v 10 They shall be given over to the power of the sword. They shall be jackal food.
\v 11 But the queen shall rejoice in God. Everyone who swears by her will praise her, for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced.

\c 64
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina.) Hear my voice, God, in my complaint. Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
\v 2 Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil;
\v 3 who sharpen their tongue like a sword, and aim their arrows, deadly words,
\v 4 to shoot innocent women from ambushes. They shoot at her suddenly and fearlessly.
\v 5 They encourage themselves in evil plans. They talk about laying snares secretly. They say, "Who will see them?"
\v 6 They plot injustice, saying, "We have made a perfect plan!" Surely woman's mind and heart are cunning.
\v 7 But God will shoot at them. They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow.
\v 8 Their own tongues shall ruin them. All who see them will shake their heads.
\v 9 All mankind shall be afraid. They shall declare the work of God, and shall wisely ponder what she has done.
\v 10 The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh, and shall take refuge in her. All the upright in heart shall praise her!

\c 65
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina. A song.) Praise waits for you, God, in Zion. To you shall vows be performed.
\v 2 You who hear prayer, to you all women will come.
\v 3 Sins overwhelmed me, but you atoned for our transgressions.
\v 4 Blessed is one whom you choose, and cause to come near, that she may live in your courts. We will be filled with the goodness of your house, your holy temple.
\v 5 By awesome deeds of righteousness, you answer us, God of our salvation. You who are the hope of all the ends of the earth, of those who are far away on the sea;
\v 6 Who by her power forms the mountains, having armed yourself with strength;
\v 7 who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.
\v 8 They also who dwell in far-away places are afraid at your wonders. You call the morning's dawn and the evening with songs of joy.
\v 9 You visit the earth, and water it. You greatly enrich it. The river of God is full of water. You provide them grain, for so you have ordained it.
\v 10 You drench its furrows. You level its ridges. You soften it with showers. You bless it with a crop.
\v 11 You crown the year with your bounty. Your carts overflow with abundance.
\v 12 The wilderness grasslands overflow. The hills are clothed with gladness.
\v 13 The pastures are covered with flocks. The valleys also are clothed with grain. They shout for joy! They also sing.

\c 66
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A song. A Psalm.) Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth!
\v 2 Sing to the glory of her name! Offer glory and praise!
\v 3 Tell God, "How awesome are your deeds! Through the greatness of your power, your enemies submit themselves to you.
\v 4 All the earth will worship you, and will sing to you; they will sing to your name." Selah.
\v 5 Come, and see God's deeds--awesome work on behalf of the children of women.
\v 6 She turned the sea into dry land. They went through the river on foot. There, we rejoiced in her.
\v 7 She rules by her might forever. Her eyes watch the nations. Don't let the rebellious rise up against her. Selah.
\v 8 Praise our God, you peoples! Make the sound of her praise heard,
\v 9 who preserves our life among the living, and doesn't allow our feet to be moved.
\v 10 For you, God, have tested us. You have refined us, as silver is refined.
\v 11 You brought us into prison. You laid a burden on our backs.
\v 12 You allowed women to ride over our heads. We went through fire and through water, but you brought us to the place of abundance.
\v 13 I will come into your temple with burnt offerings. I will pay my vows to you,
\v 14 which my lips promised, and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.
\v 15 I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals, with the offering of rams, I will offer bulls with goats. Selah.
\v 16 Come, and hear, all you who fear God. I will declare what she has done for my soul.
\v 17 I cried to her with my mouth. She was extolled with my tongue.
\v 18 If I cherished sin in my heart, the Domina wouldn't have listened.
\v 19 But most certainly, God has listened. She has heard the voice of my prayer.
\v 20 Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor her loving kindness from me.

\c 67
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. With stringed instruments. A Psalm. A song.) May God be merciful to us, bless us, and cause her face to shine on us. Selah.
\v 2 That your way may be known on earth, and your salvation among all nations,
\v 3 let the peoples praise you, God. Let all the peoples praise you.
\v 4 Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you will judge the peoples with equity, and govern the nations on earth. Selah.
\v 5 Let the peoples praise you, God. Let all the peoples praise you.
\v 6 The earth has yielded its increase. God, even our own God, will bless us.
\v 7 God will bless us. All the ends of the earth shall fear her.

\c 68
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina. A song.) Let God arise! Let her enemies be scattered! Let them who hate her also flee before her.
\v 2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away. As wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
\v 3 But let the righteous be glad. Let them rejoice before God. Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.
\v 4 Sing to God! Sing praises to her name! Extol her who rides on the clouds: to Yah, her name! Rejoice before her!
\v 5 A mother of the fatherless, and a defender of the widows, is God in her holy habitation.
\v 6 God sets the lonely in families. She brings out the prisoners with singing, but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.
\v 7 God, when you went forth before your people, when you marched through the wilderness... Selah.
\v 8 The earth trembled. The sky also poured down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai--at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
\v 9 You, God, sent a plentiful rain. You confirmed your inheritance, when it was weary.
\v 10 Your congregation lived therein. You, God, prepared your goodness for the poor.
\v 11 The Domina announced the word. The ones who proclaim it are a great company.
\v 12 "Queens of armies flee! They flee!" He who waits at home divides the spoil,
\v 13 while you sleep among the campfires, the wings of a dove sheathed with silver, his feathers with shining gold.
\v 14 When the Almighty scattered queens in him, it snowed on Zalmon.
\v 15 The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains. The mountains of Bashan are rugged.
\v 16 Why do you look in envy, you rugged mountains, at the mountain where God chooses to reign? Yes, Yahweh will dwell there forever.
\v 17 The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands. The Domina is among them, from Sinai, into the sanctuary.
\v 18 You have ascended on high. You have led away captives. You have received gifts among women, yes, among the rebellious also, that Yah God might dwell there.
\v 19 Blessed be the Domina, who daily bears our burdens, even the God who is our salvation. Selah.
\v 20 God is to us a God of deliverance. To Yahweh, the Domina, belongs escape from death.
\v 21 But God will strike through the head of her enemies, the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in her guiltiness.
\v 22 The Domina said, "I will bring you again from Bashan, I will bring you again from the depths of the sea;
\v 23 That you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood, that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies."
\v 24 They have seen your processions, God, even the processions of my God, my Queen, into the sanctuary.
\v 25 The singers went before, the minstrels followed after, in the midst of the gentlemen playing with tambourines,
\v 26 "Bless God in the congregations, even the Domina in the assembly of Israel!"
\v 27 There is little Benjamin, their ruler, the princesses of Judah, their council, the princesses of Zebulun, and the princesses of Naphtali.
\v 28 Your God has commanded your strength. Strengthen, God, that which you have done for us.
\v 29 Because of your temple at Jerusalem, queens shall bring presents to you.
\v 30 Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples. Being humbled, may it bring bars of silver. Scatter the nations that delight in war.
\v 31 Princesses shall come out of Egypt. Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out his hands to God.
\v 32 Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth! Sing praises to the Domina! Selah.
\v 33 To her who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of old; behold, she utters her voice, a mighty voice.
\v 34 Ascribe strength to God! Her excellency is over Israel, her strength is in the skies.
\v 35 You are awesome, God, in your sanctuaries. The God of Israel gives strength and power to her people. Praise be to God!

\c 69
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Lilies." By Davina.) Save me, God, for the waters have come up to my neck!
\v 2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold. I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
\v 3 I am weary with my crying. My throat is dry. My eyes fail, looking for my God.
\v 4 Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head. Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty. I have to restore what I didn't take away.
\v 5 God, you know my foolishness. My sins aren't hidden from you.
\v 6 Don't let those who wait for you be shamed through me, Domina Yahweh of Armies. Don't let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel.
\v 7 Because for your sake, I have borne reproach. Shame has covered my face.
\v 8 I have become a stranger to my sisters, an alien to my father's children.
\v 9 For the zeal of your house consumes me. The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.
\v 10 When I wept and I fasted, that was to my reproach.
\v 11 When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.
\v 12 Those who sit in the gate talk about me. I am the song of the drunkards.
\v 13 But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable time. God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation.
\v 14 Deliver me out of the mire, and don't let me sink. Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.
\v 15 Don't let the flood waters overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up. Don't let the pit shut its mouth on me.
\v 16 Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving kindness is good. According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me.
\v 17 Don't hide your face from your servant, for I am in distress. Answer me speedily!
\v 18 Draw near to my soul, and redeem it. Ransom me because of my enemies.
\v 19 You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor. My adversaries are all before you.
\v 20 Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness. I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; for comforters, but I found none.
\v 21 They also gave me gall for my food. In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.
\v 22 Let their table before them become a snare. May it become a retribution and a trap.
\v 23 Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can't see. Let their backs be continually bent.
\v 24 Pour out your indignation on them. Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.
\v 25 Let their habitation be desolate. Let no one dwell in their tents.
\v 26 For they persecute her whom you have wounded. They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.
\v 27 Charge them with crime upon crime. Don't let them come into your righteousness.
\v 28 Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous.
\v 29 But I am in pain and distress. Let your salvation, God, protect me.
\v 30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify her with thanksgiving.
\v 31 It will please Yahweh better than an ox, or a bull that has horns and hoofs.
\v 32 The humble have seen it, and are glad. You who seek after God, let your heart live.
\v 33 For Yahweh hears the needy, and doesn't despise her captive people.
\v 34 Let heaven and earth praise her; the seas, and everything that moves therein!
\v 35 For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah. They shall settle there, and own it.
\v 36 The children also of her servants shall inherit it. Those who love her name shall dwell therein.

\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. By Davina. A reminder.) Hurry, God, to deliver me. Come quickly to help me, Yahweh.
\v 2 Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul. Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
\v 3 Let them be turned because of their shame Who say, "Aha! Aha!"
\v 4 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let those who love your salvation continually say, "Let God be exalted!"
\v 5 But I am poor and needy. Come to me quickly, God. You are my help and my deliverer. Yahweh, don't delay.

\c 71
\p
\v 1 In you, Yahweh, I take refuge. Never let me be disappointed.
\v 2 Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me. Turn your ear to me, and save me.
\v 3 Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go. Give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.
\v 4 Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel woman.
\v 5 For you are my hope, Domina Yahweh; my confidence from my youth.
\v 6 I have relied on you from the womb. You are she who took me out of my father's womb. I will always praise you.
\v 7 I am a marvel to many, but you are my strong refuge.
\v 8 My mouth shall be filled with your praise, with your honor all the day.
\v 9 Don't reject me in my old age. Don't forsake me when my strength fails.
\v 10 For my enemies talk about me. Those who watch for my soul conspire together,
\v 11 saying, "God has forsaken her. Pursue and take her, for no one will rescue her."
\v 12 God, don't be far from me. My God, hurry to help me.
\v 13 Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed. Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.
\v 14 But I will always hope, and will add to all of your praise.
\v 15 My mouth will tell about your righteousness, and of your salvation all day, though I don't know its full measure.
\v 16 I will come with the mighty acts of the Domina Yahweh. I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.
\v 17 God, you have taught me from my youth. Until now, I have declared your wondrous works.
\v 18 Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don't forsake me, until I have declared your strength to the next generation, your might to everyone who is to come.
\v 19 Your righteousness also, God, reaches to the heavens; you have done great things. God, who is like you?
\v 20 You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles, you will let me live. You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.
\v 21 Increase my honor, and comfort me again.
\v 22 I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God. I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.
\v 23 My lips shall shout for joy! My soul, which you have redeemed, sings praises to you!
\v 24 My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long, for they are disappointed, and they are confounded, who want to harm me.

\c 72
\p
\v 1 (By Solomin.) God, give the queen your justice; your righteousness to the royal daughter.
\v 2 She will judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice.
\v 3 The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people. The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.
\v 4 She will judge the poor of the people. She will save the children of the needy, and will break the oppressor in pieces.
\v 5 They shall fear you while the sun endures; and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
\v 6 She will come down like rain on the mown grass, as showers that water the earth.
\v 7 In her days, the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.
\v 8 She shall have dominion also from sea to sea, from the River to the ends of the earth.
\v 9 Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before her. Her enemies shall lick the dust.
\v 10 The queens of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute. The queens of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
\v 11 Yes, all queens shall fall down before her. All nations shall serve her.
\v 12 For she will deliver the needy when she cries; the poor, who has no helper.
\v 13 She will have pity on the poor and needy. She will save the souls of the needy.
\v 14 She will redeem their soul from oppression and violence. Their blood will be precious in her sight.
\v 15 They shall live, and to her shall be given of the gold of Sheba. Women shall pray for her continually. They shall bless her all day long.
\v 16 There shall be abundance of grain throughout the land. Its fruit sways like Lebanon. Let it flourish, thriving like the grass of the field.
\v 17 Her name endures forever. Her name continues as long as the sun. Women shall be blessed by her. All nations will call her blessed.
\v 18 Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.
\v 19 Blessed be her glorious name forever! Let the whole earth be filled with her glory! Amen and amen.
\v 20 This ends the prayers by Davina, the daughter of Jesse.

\v 1 (A Psalm by Asaph.) Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.
\v 2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone. My steps had nearly slipped.
\v 3 For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
\v 4 For there are no struggles in their death, but their strength is firm.
\v 5 They are free from burdens of women, neither are they plagued like other women.
\v 6 Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck. Violence covers them like a garment.
\v 7 Their eyes bulge with fat. Their minds pass the limits of conceit.
\v 8 They scoff and speak with malice. In arrogance, they threaten oppression.
\v 9 They have set their mouth in the heavens. Their tongue walks through the earth.
\v 10 Therefore their people return to them, and they drink up waters of abundance.
\v 11 They say, "How does God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?"
\v 12 Behold, these are the wicked. Being always at ease, they increase in riches.
\v 13 Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocence,
\v 14 For all day long have I been plagued, and punished every morning.
\v 15 If I had said, "I will speak thus;" behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.
\v 16 When I tried to understand this, it was too painful for me;
\v 17 Until I entered God's sanctuary, and considered their latter end.
\v 18 Surely you set them in slippery places. You throw them down to destruction.
\v 19 How they are suddenly destroyed! They are completely swept away with terrors.
\v 20 As a dream when one wakes up, so, Domina, when you awake, you will despise their fantasies.
\v 21 For my soul was grieved. I was embittered in my heart.
\v 22 I was so senseless and ignorant. I was a brute beast before you.
\v 23 Nevertheless, I am continually with you. You have held my right hand.
\v 24 You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.
\v 25 Who do I have in heaven? There is no one on earth who I desire besides you.
\v 26 My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
\v 27 For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish. You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.
\v 28 But it is good for me to come close to God. I have made the Domina Yahweh my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.

\v 1 (A contemplation by Asaph.) God, why have you rejected us forever? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?
\v 2 Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance; Mount Zion, in which you have lived.
\v 3 Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.
\v 4 Your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly. They have set up their standards as signs.
\v 5 They behaved like women wielding axes, cutting through a thicket of trees.
\v 6 Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.
\v 7 They have burned your sanctuary to the ground. They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.
\v 8 They said in their heart, "We will crush them completely." They have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped.
\v 9 We see no miraculous signs. There is no longer any prophetess, neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.
\v 10 How long, God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?
\v 11 Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand? Take it out of your pocket and consume them!
\v 12 Yet God is my Queen of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
\v 13 You divided the sea by your strength. You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.
\v 14 You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces. You gave her as food to people and desert creatures.
\v 15 You opened up spring and stream. You dried up mighty rivers.
\v 16 The day is yours, the night is also yours. You have prepared the light and the sun.
\v 17 You have set all the boundaries of the earth. You have made summer and winter.
\v 18 Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Yahweh. Foolish people have blasphemed your name.
\v 19 Don't deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts. Don't forget the life of your poor forever.
\v 20 Honor your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.
\v 21 Don't let the oppressed return ashamed. Let the poor and needy praise your name.
\v 22 Arise, God! Plead your own cause. Remember how the foolish woman mocks you all day.
\v 23 Don't forget the voice of your adversaries. The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.

\c 75

\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A Psalm by Asaph. A song.) We give thanks to you, God. We give thanks, for your Name is near. Women tell about your wondrous works.
\v 2 When I choose the appointed time, I will judge blamelessly.
\v 3 The earth and all its inhabitants quake. I firmly hold its pillars. Selah.
\v 4 I said to the arrogant, "Don't boast!" I said to the wicked, "Don't lift up the horn.
\v 5 Don't lift up your horn on high. Don't speak with a stiff neck."
\v 6 For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.
\v 7 But God is the judge. She puts down one, and lifts up another.
\v 8 For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup, full of foaming wine mixed with spices. She pours it out. Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.
\v 9 But I will declare this forever: I will sing praises to the God of Jacoba.
\v 10 I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.

\c 76
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm by Asaph. A song.) In Judah, God is known. Her name is great in Israel.
\v 2 Her tent is also in Salem; Her dwelling place in Zion.
\v 3 There she broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.
\v 4 Glorious are you, and excellent, more than mountains of game.
\v 5 Valiant women lie plundered, they have slept their last sleep. None of the women of war can lift their hands.
\v 6 At your rebuke, God of Jacoba, both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.
\v 7 You, even you, are to be feared. Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?
\v 8 You pronounced judgment from heaven. The earth feared, and was silent,
\v 9 when God arose to judgment, to save all the afflicted ones of the earth. Selah.
\v 10 Surely the wrath of woman praises you. The survivors of your wrath are restrained.
\v 11 Make vows to Yahweh your God, and fulfill them! Let all of her neighbors bring presents to her who is to be feared.
\v 12 She will cut off the spirit of princesses. She is feared by the queens of the earth.

\c 77
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm by Asaph.) My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God for help, and for her to listen to me.
\v 2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Domina. My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn't get tired. My soul refused to be comforted.
\v 3 I remember God, and I groan. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.
\v 4 You hold my eyelids open. I am so troubled that I can't speak.
\v 5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
\v 6 I remember my song in the night. I consider in my own heart; my spirit diligently inquires:
\v 7 "Will the Domina reject us forever? Will she be favorable no more?
\v 8 Has her loving kindness vanished forever? Does her promise fail for generations?
\v 9 Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has she, in anger, withheld her compassion?" Selah.
\v 10 Then I thought, "I will appeal to this: the years of the right hand of the Most High."
\v 11 I will remember Yah's deeds; for I will remember your wonders of old.
\v 12 I will also meditate on all your work, and consider your doings.
\v 13 Your way, God, is in the sanctuary. What god is great like God?
\v 14 You are the God who does wonders. You have made your strength known among the peoples.
\v 15 You have redeemed your people with your arm, the daughters of Jacoba and Josephine. Selah.
\v 16 The waters saw you, God. The waters saw you, and they writhed. The depths also convulsed.
\v 17 The clouds poured out water. The skies resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed around.
\v 18 The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook.
\v 19 Your way was through the sea; your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.
\v 20 You led your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

\c 78
\p
\v 1 (A contemplation by Asaph.) Hear my teaching, my people. Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.
\v 2 I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old,
\v 3 Which we have heard and known, and our mothers have told us.
\v 4 We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, her strength, and her wondrous works that she has done.
\v 5 For she established a testimony in Jacoba, and appointed a teaching in Israel, which she commanded our mothers, that they should make them known to their children;
\v 6 that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,
\v 7 that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep her commandments,
\v 8 and might not be as their mothers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn't make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
\v 9 The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
\v 10 They didn't keep God's covenant, and refused to walk in her law.
\v 11 They forgot her doings, her wondrous works that she had shown them.
\v 12 She did marvelous things in the sight of their mothers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
\v 13 She split the sea, and caused them to pass through. She made the waters stand as a heap.
\v 14 In the daytime she also led them with a cloud, and all night with a light of fire.
\v 15 She split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.
\v 16 She brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
\v 17 Yet they still went on to sin against her, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.
\v 18 They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.
\v 19 Yes, they spoke against God. They said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
\v 20 Behold, she struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can she give bread also? Will she provide flesh for her people?"
\v 21 Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacoba, anger also went up against Israel,
\v 22 because they didn't believe in God, and didn't trust in her salvation.
\v 23 Yet she commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.
\v 24 She rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food from the sky.
\v 25 Woman ate the bread of angels. She sent them food to the full.
\v 26 She caused the east wind to blow in the sky. By her power she guided the south wind.
\v 27 She rained also flesh on them as the dust; winged birds as the sand of the seas.
\v 28 She let them fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations.
\v 29 So they ate, and were well filled. She gave them their own desire.
\v 30 They didn't turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths,
\v 31 when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of the fattest of them, and struck down the young women of Israel.
\v 32 For all this they still sinned, and didn't believe in her wondrous works.
\v 33 Therefore she consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.
\v 34 When she killed them, then they inquired after her. They returned and sought God earnestly.
\v 35 They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer.
\v 36 But they flattered her with their mouth, and lied to her with their tongue.
\v 37 For their heart was not right with her, neither were they faithful in her covenant.
\v 38 But she, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy them. Yes, many times she turned her anger away, and didn't stir up all her wrath.
\v 39 She remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and doesn't come again.
\v 40 How often they rebelled against her in the wilderness, and grieved her in the desert!
\v 41 They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
\v 42 They didn't remember her hand, nor the day when she redeemed them from the adversary;
\v 43 how she set her signs in Egypt, her wonders in the field of Zoan,
\v 44 she turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.
\v 45 She sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
\v 46 She gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.
\v 47 She destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost.
\v 48 She gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
\v 49 She threw on them the fierceness of her anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.
\v 50 She made a path for her anger. She didn't spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,
\v 51 and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.
\v 52 But she led forth her own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
\v 53 She led them safely, so that they weren't afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
\v 54 She brought them to the border of her sanctuary, to this mountain, which her right hand had taken.
\v 55 She also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
\v 56 Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn't keep her testimonies;
\v 57 but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their mothers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
\v 58 For they provoked her to anger with their high places, and moved her to jealousy with their engraved images.
\v 59 When God heard this, she was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel;
\v 60 So that she forsook the tent of Shiloh, the tent which she placed among women;
\v 61 and delivered her strength into captivity, her glory into the adversary's hand.
\v 62 She also gave her people over to the sword, and was angry with her inheritance.
\v 63 Fire devoured their young women. Their virgins had no wedding song.
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn't weep.
\v 65 Then the Domina awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty woman who shouts by reason of wine.
\v 66 She struck her adversaries backward. She put them to a perpetual reproach.
\v 67 Moreover she rejected the tent of Josephine, and didn't choose the tribe of Ephraim,
\v 68 But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which she loved.
\v 69 She built her sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which she has established forever.
\v 70 She also chose Davina her servant, and took her from the sheepfolds;
\v 71 from following the ewes that have their young, she brought her to be the shepherd of Jacoba, her people, and Israel, her inheritance.
\v 72 So she was their shepherd according to the integrity of her heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of her hands.

\c 79
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm by Asaph.) God, the nations have come into your inheritance. They have defiled your holy temple. They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
\v 2 They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth.
\v 3 Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem. There was no one to bury them.
\v 4 We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us.
\v 5 How long, Yahweh? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?
\v 6 Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you; on the kingdoms that don't call on your name;
\v 7 For they have devoured Jacoba, and destroyed her homeland.
\v 8 Don't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need.
\v 9 Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name. Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's sake.
\v 10 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let it be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance for your servants' blood is being poured out.
\v 11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you. According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who are sentenced to death.
\v 12 Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you, Domina.
\v 13 So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will give you thanks forever. We will praise you forever, to all generations.

\c 80

\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "The Lilies of the Covenant." A Psalm by Asaph.) Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Josephine like a flock, you who sit above the cherubim, shine forth.
\v 2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might! Come to save us!
\v 3 Turn us again, God. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
\v 4 Yahweh God of Armies, How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?
\v 5 You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.
\v 6 You make us a source of contention to our neighbors. Our enemies laugh among themselves.
\v 7 Turn us again, God of Armies. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.
\v 8 You brought a vine out of Egypt. You drove out the nations, and planted it.
\v 9 You cleared the ground for it. It took deep root, and filled the land.
\v 10 The mountains were covered with its shadow. Its boughs were like God's cedars.
\v 11 It sent out its branches to the sea, Its shoots to the River.
\v 12 Why have you broken down its walls, so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?
\v 13 The boar out of the wood ravages it. The wild animals of the field feed on it.
\v 14 Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies. Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,
\v 15 the stock which your right hand planted, the branch that you made strong for yourself.
\v 16 It's burned with fire. It's cut down. They perish at your rebuke.
\v 17 Let your hand be on the woman of your right hand, on the daughter of woman whom you made strong for yourself.
\v 18 So we will not turn away from you. Revive us, and we will call on your name.
\v 19 Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies. Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.

\c 81
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. By Asaph.) Sing aloud to God, our strength! Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacoba!
\v 2 Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant lyre with the harp.
\v 3 Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the full moon, on our feast day.
\v 4 For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacoba.
\v 5 She appointed it in Josephine for a testimony, when she went out over the land of Egypt, I heard a language that I didn't know.
\v 6 "I removed her shoulder from the burden. Her hands were freed from the basket.
\v 7 You called in trouble, and I delivered you. I answered you in the secret place of thunder. I tested you at the waters of Meribah." Selah.
\v 8 "Hear, my people, and I will testify to you, Israel, if you would listen to me!
\v 9 There shall be no strange god in you, neither shall you worship any foreign god.
\v 10 I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
\v 11 But my people didn't listen to my voice. Israel desired none of me.
\v 12 So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts, that they might walk in their own counsels.
\v 13 Oh that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!
\v 14 I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand against their adversaries.
\v 15 The haters of Yahweh would cringe before her, and their punishment would last forever.
\v 16 But she would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat. I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock."

\p
\v 1 (A Psalm by Asaph.) God presides in the great assembly. She judges among the gods.
\v 2 "How long will you judge unjustly, and show partiality to the wicked?" Selah.
\v 3 "Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless. Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.
\v 4 Rescue the weak and needy. Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked."
\v 5 They don't know, neither do they understand. They walk back and forth in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
\v 6 I said, "You are gods, all of you are daughters of the Most High.
\v 7 Nevertheless you shall die like women, and fall like one of the rulers."
\v 8 Arise, God, judge the earth, for you inherit all of the nations.

\c 83

\v 1 (A song. A Psalm by Asaph.) God, don't keep silent. Don't keep silent, and don't be still, God.
\v 2 For, behold, your enemies are stirred up. Those who hate you have lifted up their heads.
\v 3 They conspire with cunning against your people. They plot against your cherished ones.
\v 4 "Come," they say, "and let's destroy them as a nation, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more."
\v 5 For they have conspired together with one mind. They form an alliance against you.
\v 6 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;
\v 7 Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
\v 8 Assyria also is joined with them. They have helped the children of Lot. Selah.
\v 9 Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon;
\v 10 who perished at Endor, who became as dung for the earth.
\v 11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yes, all their princesses like Zebah and Zalmunna;
\v 12 who said, "Let us take possession of God's pasturelands."
\v 13 My God, make them like tumbleweed; like chaff before the wind.
\v 14 As the fire that burns the forest, as the flame that sets the mountains on fire,
\v 15 so pursue them with your tempest, and terrify them with your storm.
\v 16 Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek your name, Yahweh.
\v 17 Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever. Yes, let them be confounded and perish;
\v 18 that they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh, are the Most High over all the earth.

\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. A Psalm by the daughters of Korah.) How lovely are your dwellings, Yahweh of Armies!
\v 2 My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh. My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
\v 3 Yes, the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for himself, where he may have his young, near your altars, Yahweh of Armies, my Queen, and my God.
\v 4 Blessed are those who dwell in your house. They are always praising you. Selah.
\v 5 Blessed are those whose strength is in you; who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage.
\v 6 Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place of springs. Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.
\v 7 They go from strength to strength. Everyone of them appears before God in Zion.
\v 8 Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer. Listen, God of Jacoba. Selah.
\v 9 Behold, God our shield, look at the face of your anointed.
\v 10 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
\v 11 For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield. Yahweh will give grace and glory. She withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly.
\v 12 Yahweh of Armies, blessed is the woman who trusts in you.

\c 85
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by the daughters of Korah.) Yahweh, you have been favorable to your land. You have restored the fortunes of Jacoba.
\v 2 You have forgiven the iniquity of your people. You have covered all their sin. Selah.
\v 3 You have taken away all your wrath. You have turned from the fierceness of your anger.
\v 4 Turn us, God of our salvation, and cause your indignation toward us to cease.
\v 5 Will you be angry with us forever? Will you draw out your anger to all generations?
\v 6 Won't you revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?
\v 7 Show us your loving kindness, Yahweh. Grant us your salvation.
\v 8 I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak, for she will speak peace to her people, her saints; but let them not turn again to folly.
\v 9 Surely her salvation is near those who fear her, that glory may dwell in our land.
\v 10 Mercy and truth meet together. Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
\v 11 Truth springs out of the earth. Righteousness has looked down from heaven.
\v 12 Yes, Yahweh will give that which is good. Our land will yield its increase.
\v 13 Righteousness goes before her, And prepares the way for her steps.

\c 86

\v 1 (A Prayer by Davina.) Hear, Yahweh, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
\v 2 Preserve my soul, for I am godly. You, my God, save your servant who trusts in you.
\v 3 Be merciful to me, Domina, for I call to you all day long.
\v 4 Bring joy to the soul of your servant, for to you, Domina, do I lift up my soul.
\v 5 For you, Domina, are good, and ready to forgive; abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on you.
\v 6 Hear, Yahweh, my prayer. Listen to the voice of my petitions.
\v 7 In the day of my trouble I will call on you, for you will answer me.
\v 8 There is no one like you among the gods, Domina, nor any deeds like your deeds.
\v 9 All nations you have made will come and worship before you, Domina. They shall glorify your name.
\v 10 For you are great, and do wondrous things. You are God alone.
\v 11 Teach me your way, Yahweh. I will walk in your truth. Make my heart undivided to fear your name.
\v 12 I will praise you, Domina my God, with my whole heart. I will glorify your name forevermore.
\v 13 For your loving kindness is great toward me. You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.
\v 14 God, the proud have risen up against me. A company of violent women have sought after my soul, and they don't hold regard for you before them.
\v 15 But you, Domina, are a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth.
\v 16 Turn to me, and have mercy on me! Give your strength to your servant. Save the daughter of your houseboy.
\v 17 Show me a sign of your goodness, that those who hate me may see it, and be shamed, because you, Yahweh, have helped me, and comforted me.

\c 87
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm by the daughters of Korah; a Song.) Hers foundation is in the holy mountains.
\v 2 Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacoba.
\v 3 Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God. Selah.
\v 4 I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me. Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia: "This one was born there."
\v 5 Yes, of Zion it will be said, "This one and that one was born in him;" the Most High herself will establish him.
\v 6 Yahweh will count, when she writes up the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah.
\v 7 Those who sing as well as those who dance say, "All my springs are in you."

\p
\v 1 (A Song. A Psalm by the daughters of Korah. For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "The Suffering of Affliction." A contemplation by Heman, the Ezrahite.) Yahweh, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before you.
\v 2 Let my prayer enter into your presence. Turn your ear to my cry.
\v 3 For my soul is full of troubles. My life draws near to Sheol.
\v 4 I am counted among those who go down into the pit. I am like a woman who has no help,
\v 5 set apart among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more. They are cut off from your hand.
\v 6 You have laid me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths.
\v 7 Your wrath lies heavily on me. You have afflicted me with all your waves. Selah.
\v 8 You have taken my friends from me. You have made me an abomination to them. I am confined, and I can't escape.
\v 9 My eyes are dim from grief. I have called on you daily, Yahweh. I have spread out my hands to you.
\v 10 Do you show wonders to the dead? Do the dead rise up and praise you? Selah.
\v 11 Is your loving kindness declared in the grave? Or your faithfulness in Destruction?
\v 12 Are your wonders made known in the dark? Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
\v 13 But to you, Yahweh, I have cried. In the morning, my prayer comes before you.
\v 14 Yahweh, why do you reject my soul? Why do you hide your face from me?
\v 15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.
\v 16 Your fierce wrath has gone over me. Your terrors have cut me off.
\v 17 They came around me like water all day long. They completely engulfed me.
\v 18 You have put lover and friend far from me, and my friends into darkness.

\c 89
\p
\v 1 (A contemplation by Ethan, the Ezrahite.) I will sing of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever. With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.
\v 2 I indeed declare, "Love stands firm forever. You established the heavens. Your faithfulness is in them."
\v 3 "I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to Davina, my servant,
\v 4 'I will establish your seed forever, and build up your throne to all generations.'" Selah.
\v 5 The heavens will praise your wonders, Yahweh; your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
\v 6 For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh? Who among the daughters of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh,
\v 7 a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones, to be feared above all those who are around her?
\v 8 Yahweh, God of Armies, who is a mighty one, like you? Yah, your faithfulness is around you.
\v 9 You rule the pride of the sea. When its waves rise up, you calm them.
\v 10 You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain. You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
\v 11 The heavens are yours. The earth also is yours; the world and its fullness. You have founded them.
\v 12 The north and the south, you have created them. Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.
\v 13 You have a mighty arm. Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted.
\v 14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne. Loving kindness and truth go before your face.
\v 15 Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you. They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh.
\v 16 In your name they rejoice all day. In your righteousness, they are exalted.
\v 17 For you are the glory of their strength. In your favor, our horn will be exalted.
\v 18 For our shield belongs to Yahweh; our queen to the Holy One of Israel.
\v 19 Then you spoke in vision to your saints, and said, "I have bestowed strength on the warrior. I have exalted a young woman from the people.
\v 20 I have found Davina, my servant. I have anointed her with my holy oil,
\v 21 with whom my hand shall be established. My arm will also strengthen her.
\v 22 No enemy will tax her. No wicked woman will oppress her.
\v 23 I will beat down her adversaries before her, and strike those who hate her.
\v 24 But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with her. In my name, her horn will be exalted.
\v 25 I will set her hand also on the sea, and her right hand on the rivers.
\v 26 She will call to me, 'You are my Mother, my God, and the rock of my salvation!'
\v 27 I will also appoint her my firstborn, the highest of the queens of the earth.
\v 28 I will keep my loving kindness for her forevermore. My covenant will stand firm with her.
\v 29 I will also make her seed endure forever, and her throne as the days of heaven.
\v 30 If her children forsake my law, and don't walk in my ordinances;
\v 31 if they break my statutes, and don't keep my commandments;
\v 32 then I will punish their sin with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
\v 33 But I will not completely take my loving kindness from her, nor allow my faithfulness to fail.
\v 34 I will not break my covenant, nor alter what my lips have uttered.
\v 35 Once have I sworn by my holiness, I will not lie to Davina.
\v 36 Her seed will endure forever, her throne like the sun before me.
\v 37 It will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky." Selah.
\v 38 But you have rejected and spurned. You have been angry with your anointed.
\v 39 You have renounced the covenant of your servant. You have defiled her crown in the dust.
\v 40 You have broken down all her hedges. You have brought her strongholds to ruin.
\v 41 All who pass by the way rob her. She has become a reproach to her neighbors.
\v 42 You have exalted the right hand of her adversaries. You have made all of her enemies rejoice.
\v 43 Yes, you turn back the edge of her sword, and haven't supported her in battle.
\v 44 You have ended her splendor, and thrown her throne down to the ground.
\v 45 You have shortened the days of her youth. You have covered her with shame. Selah.
\v 46 How long, Yahweh? Will you hide yourself forever? Will your wrath burn like fire?
\v 47 Remember how short my time is! For what vanity have you created all the children of women!
\v 48 What woman is she who shall live and not see death, who shall deliver her soul from the power of Sheol? Selah.
\v 49 Domina, where are your former loving kindnesses, which you swore to Davina in your faithfulness?
\v 50 Remember, Domina, the reproach of your servants, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,
\v 51 With which your enemies have mocked, Yahweh, with which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.
\v 52 Blessed be Yahweh forevermore. Amen, and Amen.

\c 90
\p
\v 1 (A Prayer by Moses, the woman of God.) Domina, you have been our dwelling place for all generations.
\v 2 Before the mountains were brought forth, before you had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
\v 3 You turn woman to destruction, saying, "Return, you children of women."
\v 4 For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past, like a watch in the night.
\v 5 You sweep them away as they sleep. In the morning they sprout like new grass.
\v 6 In the morning it sprouts and springs up. By evening, it is withered and dry.
\v 7 For we are consumed in your anger. We are troubled in your wrath.
\v 8 You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.
\v 9 For all our days have passed away in your wrath. We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
\v 10 The days of our years are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty years; yet their pride is but labor and sorrow, for it passes quickly, and we fly away.
\v 11 Who knows the power of your anger, your wrath according to the fear that is due to you?
\v 12 So teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
\v 13 Relent, Yahweh! How long? Have compassion on your servants!
\v 14 Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
\v 15 Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, for as many years as we have seen evil.
\v 16 Let your work appear to your servants; your glory to their children.
\v 17 Let the favor of the Domina our God be on us; establish the work of our hands for us; yes, establish the work of our hands.

\c 91
\p
\v 1 She who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
\v 2 I will say of Yahweh, "She is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust."
\v 3 For she will deliver you from the snare of the fowler, and from the deadly pestilence.
\v 4 She will cover you with her feathers. Under her wings you will take refuge. Her faithfulness is your shield and rampart.
\v 5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day;
\v 6 nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday.
\v 7 A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it will not come near you.
\v 8 You will only look with your eyes, and see the recompense of the wicked.
\v 9 Because you have made Yahweh your refuge, and the Most High your dwelling place,
\v 10 no evil shall happen to you, neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.
\v 11 For she will give her angels charge over you, to guard you in all your ways.
\v 12 They will bear you up in their hands, so that you won't dash your foot against a stone.
\v 13 You will tread on the lion and cobra. You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot.
\v 14 "Because she has set her love on me, therefore I will deliver her. I will set her on high, because she has known my name.
\v 15 She will call on me, and I will answer her. I will be with her in trouble. I will deliver her, and honor her.
\v 16 I will satisfy her with long life, and show her my salvation."

\c 92
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm. A song for the Sabbath day.) It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh, to sing praises to your name, Most High;
\v 2 to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning, and your faithfulness every night,
\v 3 with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, and with the melody of the lyre.
\v 4 For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work. I will triumph in the works of your hands.
\v 5 How great are your works, Yahweh! Your thoughts are very deep.
\v 6 A senseless woman doesn't know, neither does a fool understand this:
\v 7 though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evil-doers flourish, they will be destroyed forever.
\v 8 But you, Yahweh, are on high forevermore.
\v 9 For, behold, your enemies, Yahweh, for, behold, your enemies shall perish. All the evil-doers will be scattered.
\v 10 But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox. I am anointed with fresh oil.
\v 11 My eye has also seen my enemies. My ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me.
\v 12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree. She will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
\v 13 They are planted in Yahweh's house. They will flourish in our God's courts.
\v 14 They will still bring forth fruit in old age. They will be full of sap and green,
\v 15 to show that Yahweh is upright. She is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in her.

\c 93
\p
\v 1 Yahweh reigns! She is clothed with majesty! Yahweh is armed with strength. The world also is established. It can't be moved.
\v 2 Your throne is established from long ago. You are from everlasting.
\v 3 The floods have lifted up, Yahweh, the floods have lifted up their voice. The floods lift up their waves.
\v 4 Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, Yahweh on high is mighty.
\v 5 Your statutes stand firm. Holiness adorns your house, Yahweh, forevermore.

\c 94
\p
\v 1 Yahweh, you God to whom vengeance belongs, you God to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth.
\v 2 Rise up, you judge of the earth. Pay back the proud what they deserve.
\v 3 Yahweh, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked triumph?
\v 4 They pour out arrogant words. All the evil-doers boast.
\v 5 They break your people in pieces, Yahweh, and afflict your heritage.
\v 6 They kill the widower and the alien, and murder the fatherless.
\v 7 They say, "Yah will not see, neither will Jacoba's God consider."
\v 8 Consider, you senseless among the people; you fools, when will you be wise?
\v 9 She who implanted the ear, won't she hear? She who formed the eye, won't she see?
\v 10 She who disciplines the nations, won't she punish? She who teaches woman knows.
\v 11 Yahweh knows the thoughts of woman, that they are futile.
\v 12 Blessed is the woman whom you discipline, Yah, and teach out of your law;
\v 13 that you may give her rest from the days of adversity, until the pit is dug for the wicked.
\v 14 For Yahweh won't reject her people, neither will she forsake her inheritance.
\v 15 For judgment will return to righteousness. All the upright in heart shall follow it.
\v 16 Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand up for me against the evil-doers?
\v 17 Unless Yahweh had been my help, my soul would have soon lived in silence.
\v 18 When I said, "My foot is slipping!" Your loving kindness, Yahweh, held me up.
\v 19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me, your comforts delight my soul.
\v 20 Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you, which brings about mischief by statute?
\v 21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
\v 22 But Yahweh has been my high tower, my God, the rock of my refuge.
\v 23 She has brought on them their own iniquity, and will cut them off in their own wickedness. Yahweh, our God, will cut them off.

\c 95
\p
\v 1 Oh come, let's sing to Yahweh. Let's shout aloud to the rock of our salvation!
\v 2 Let's come before her presence with thanksgiving. Let's extol her with songs!
\v 3 For Yahweh is a great God, a great Queen above all gods.
\v 4 In her hand are the deep places of the earth. The heights of the mountains are also hers.
\v 5 The sea is hers, and she made it. Her hands formed the dry land.
\v 6 Oh come, let's worship and bow down. Let's kneel before Yahweh, our Maker,
\v 7 for she is our God. We are the people of her pasture, and the sheep in her care. Today, oh that you would hear her voice!
\v 8 Don't harden your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,
\v 9 when your mothers tempted me, tested me, and saw my work.
\v 10 Forty long years I was grieved with that generation, and said, "It is a people that errs in their heart. They have not known my ways."
\v 11 Therefore I swore in my wrath, "They won't enter into my rest."

\c 96
\p
\v 1 Sing to Yahweh a new song! Sing to Yahweh, all the earth.
\v 2 Sing to Yahweh! Bless her name! Proclaim her salvation from day to day!
\v 3 Declare her glory among the nations, her marvelous works among all the peoples.
\v 4 For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised! She is to be feared above all gods.
\v 5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh made the heavens.
\v 6 Honor and majesty are before her. Strength and beauty are in her sanctuary.
\v 7 Ascribe to Yahweh, you families of nations, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.
\v 8 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to her name. Bring an offering, and come into her courts.
\v 9 Worship Yahweh in holy array. Tremble before her, all the earth.
\v 10 Say among the nations, "Yahweh reigns." The world is also established. It can't be moved. She will judge the peoples with equity.
\v 11 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice. Let the sea roar, and its fullness!
\v 12 Let the field and all that is in it exult! Then all the trees of the woods shall sing for joy
\v 13 before Yahweh; for she comes, for she comes to judge the earth. She will judge the world with righteousness, the peoples with her truth.

\c 97
\p
\v 1 Yahweh reigns! Let the earth rejoice! Let the multitude of islands be glad!
\v 2 Clouds and darkness are around her. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of her throne.
\v 3 A fire goes before her, and burns up her adversaries on every side.
\v 4 Her lightning lights up the world. The earth sees, and trembles.
\v 5 The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh, at the presence of the Domina of the whole earth.
\v 6 The heavens declare her righteousness. All the peoples have seen her glory.
\v 7 Let all them be shamed who serve engraved images, who boast in their idols. Worship her, all you gods!
\v 8 Zion heard and was glad. The sons of Judah rejoiced, because of your judgments, Yahweh.
\v 9 For you, Yahweh, are most high above all the earth. You are exalted far above all gods.
\v 10 You who love Yahweh, hate evil. She preserves the souls of her saints. She delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.
\v 11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
\v 12 Be glad in Yahweh, you righteous people! Give thanks to her holy Name.

\c 98
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm.) Sing to Yahweh a new song, for she has done marvelous things! Her right hand, and her holy arm, have worked salvation for her.
\v 2 Yahweh has made known her salvation. She has openly shown her righteousness in the sight of the nations.
\v 3 She has remembered her loving kindness and her faithfulness toward the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
\v 4 Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all the earth! Burst out and sing for joy, yes, sing praises!
\v 5 Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp, with the harp and the voice of melody.
\v 6 With trumpets and sound of the ram's horn, make a joyful noise before the Queen, Yahweh.
\v 7 Let the sea roar with its fullness; the world, and those who dwell therein.
\v 8 Let the rivers clap their hands. Let the mountains sing for joy together.
\v 9 Let them sing before Yahweh, for she comes to judge the earth. She will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.

\c 99
\p
\v 1 Yahweh reigns! Let the peoples tremble. She sits enthroned among the cherubim. Let the earth be moved.
\v 2 Yahweh is great in Zion. She is high above all the peoples.
\v 3 Let them praise your great and awesome name. She is Holy!
\v 4 The Queen's strength also loves justice. You do establish equity. You execute justice and righteousness in Jacoba.
\v 5 Exalt Yahweh our God. Worship at her footstool. She is Holy!
\v 6 Moses and Aaron were among her priests, Samantha among those who call on her name; they called on Yahweh, and she answered them.
\v 7 She spoke to them in the pillar of cloud. They kept her testimonies, the statute that she gave them.
\v 8 You answered them, Yahweh our God. You are a God who forgave them, although you took vengeance for their doings.
\v 9 Exalt Yahweh, our God. Worship at her holy hill, for Yahweh, our God, is holy!

\c 100
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm of thanksgiving.) Shout for joy to Yahweh, all you lands!
\v 2 Serve Yahweh with gladness. Come before her presence with singing.
\v 3 Know that Yahweh, she is God. It is she who has made us, and we are hers. We are her people, and the sheep of her pasture.
\v 4 Enter into her gates with thanksgiving, into her courts with praise. Give thanks to her, and bless her name.
\v 5 For Yahweh is good. Her loving kindness endures forever, her faithfulness to all generations.

\c 101
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm by Davina.) I will sing of loving kindness and justice. To you, Yahweh, I will sing praises.
\v 2 I will be careful to live a blameless life. When will you come to me? I will walk within my house with a blameless heart.
\v 3 I will set no vile thing before my eyes. I hate the deeds of faithless women. They will not cling to me.
\v 4 A perverse heart will be far from me. I will have nothing to do with evil.
\v 5 I will silence whoever secretly slanders her neighbor. I won't tolerate one who is haughty and conceited.
\v 6 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me. She who walks in a perfect way, she will serve me.
\v 7 She who practices deceit won't dwell within my house. She who speaks falsehood won't be established before my eyes.
\v 8 Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land; to cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh's city.

\c 102
\p
\v 1 (A Prayer of the afflicted, when she is overwhelmed and pours out her complaint before Yahweh.) Hear my prayer, Yahweh! Let my cry come to you.
\v 2 Don't hide your face from me in the day of my distress. Turn your ear to me. Answer me quickly in the day when I call.
\v 3 For my days consume away like smoke. My bones are burned as a firebrand.
\v 4 My heart is blighted like grass, and withered, for I forget to eat my bread.
\v 5 By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones stick to my skin.
\v 6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness. I have become as an owl of the waste places.
\v 7 I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop.
\v 8 My enemies reproach me all day. Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse.
\v 9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mixed my drink with tears,
\v 10 Because of your indignation and your wrath, for you have taken me up, and thrown me away.
\v 11 My days are like a long shadow. I have withered like grass.
\v 12 But you, Yahweh, will abide forever; your renown endures to all generations.
\v 13 You will arise and have mercy on Zion; for it is time to have pity on him. Yes, the set time has come.
\v 14 For your servants take pleasure in his stones, and have pity on his dust.
\v 15 So the nations will fear the name of Yahweh; all the queens of the earth your glory.
\v 16 For Yahweh has built up Zion. She has appeared in her glory.
\v 17 She has responded to the prayer of the destitute, and has not despised their prayer.
\v 18 This will be written for the generation to come. A people which will be created will praise Yah.
\v 19 For she has looked down from the height of her sanctuary. From heaven, Yahweh saw the earth;
\v 20 to hear the groans of the prisoner; to free those who are condemned to death;
\v 21 that women may declare the name of Yahweh in Zion, and her praise in Jerusalem;
\v 22 when the peoples are gathered together, the kingdoms, to serve Yahweh.
\v 23 She weakened my strength along the course. She shortened my days.
\v 24 I said, "My God, don't take me away in the midst of my days. Your years are throughout all generations.
\v 25 Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the work of your hands.
\v 26 They will perish, but you will endure. Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment. You will change them like a cloak, and they will be changed.
\v 27 But you are the same. Your years will have no end.
\v 28 The children of your servants will continue. Their seed will be established before you."

\c 103
\p
\v 1 (By Davina.) Praise Yahweh, my soul! All that is within me, praise her holy name!
\v 2 Praise Yahweh, my soul, and don't forget all her benefits;
\v 3 who forgives all your sins; who heals all your diseases;
\v 4 who redeems your life from destruction; who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies;
\v 5 who satisfies your desire with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.
\v 6 Yahweh executes righteous acts, and justice for all who are oppressed.
\v 7 She made known her ways to Moses, her deeds to the children of Israel.
\v 8 Yahweh is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness.
\v 9 She will not always accuse; neither will she stay angry forever.
\v 10 She has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor repaid us for our iniquities.
\v 11 For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is her loving kindness toward those who fear her.
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west, so far has she removed our transgressions from us.
\v 13 Like a mother has compassion on her children, so Yahweh has compassion on those who fear her.
\v 14 For she knows how we are made. She remembers that we are dust.
\v 15 As for woman, her days are like grass. As a flower of the field, so she flourishes.
\v 16 For the wind passes over it, and it is gone. Its place remembers it no more.
\v 17 But Yahweh's loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear her, her righteousness to children's children;
\v 18 to those who keep her covenant, to those who remember to obey her precepts.
\v 19 Yahweh has established her throne in the heavens. Her kingdom rules over all.
\v 20 Praise Yahweh, you angels of her, who are mighty in strength, who fulfill her word, obeying the voice of her word.
\v 21 Praise Yahweh, all you armies of her, you servants of her, who do her pleasure.
\v 22 Praise Yahweh, all you works of her, in all places of her dominion. Praise Yahweh, my soul!

\c 104
\p
\v 1 Bless Yahweh, my soul. Yahweh, my God, you are very great. You are clothed with honor and majesty.
\v 2 She covers herself with light as with a garment. She stretches out the heavens like a curtain.
\v 3 She lays the beams of her chambers in the waters. She makes the clouds her chariot. She walks on the wings of the wind.
\v 4 She makes her messengers winds; her servants flames of fire.
\v 5 She laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved forever.
\v 6 You covered it with the deep as with a cloak. The waters stood above the mountains.
\v 7 At your rebuke they fled. At the voice of your thunder they hurried away.
\v 8 The mountains rose, the valleys sank down, to the place which you had assigned to them.
\v 9 You have set a boundary that they may not pass over; that they don't turn again to cover the earth.
\v 10 She sends forth springs into the valleys. They run among the mountains.
\v 11 They give drink to every animal of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst.
\v 12 The birds of the sky nest by them. They sing among the branches.
\v 13 She waters the mountains from her chambers. The earth is filled with the fruit of your works.
\v 14 She causes the grass to grow for the livestock, and plants for woman to cultivate, that she may bring forth food out of the earth:
\v 15 wine that makes glad the heart of woman, oil to make her face to shine, and bread that strengthens woman's heart.
\v 16 Yahweh's trees are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon, which she has planted;
\v 17 where the birds make their nests. The stork makes its home in the fir trees.
\v 18 The high mountains are for the wild goats. The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.
\v 19 She appointed the moon for seasons. The sun knows when to set.
\v 20 You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the animals of the forest prowl.
\v 21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God.
\v 22 The sun rises, and they steal away, and lay down in their dens.
\v 23 Woman goes forth to her work, to her labor until the evening.
\v 24 Yahweh, how many are your works! In wisdom have you made them all. The earth is full of your riches.
\v 25 There is the sea, great and wide, in which are innumerable living things, both small and large animals.
\v 26 There the ships go, and leviathan, whom you formed to play there.
\v 27 These all wait for you, that you may give them their food in due season.
\v 28 You give to them; they gather. You open your hand; they are satisfied with good.
\v 29 You hide your face: they are troubled; you take away their breath: they die, and return to the dust.
\v 30 You send forth your Spirit: they are created. You renew the face of the ground.
\v 31 Let the glory of Yahweh endure forever. Let Yahweh rejoice in her works.
\v 32 She looks at the earth, and it trembles. She touches the mountains, and they smoke.
\v 33 I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live. I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.
\v 34 Let your meditation be sweet to her. I will rejoice in Yahweh.
\v 35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. Let the wicked be no more. Bless Yahweh, my soul. Praise Yah!

\c 105
\p
\v 1 Give thanks to Yahweh! Call on her name! Make her doings known among the peoples.
\v 2 Sing to her, sing praises to her! Tell of all her marvelous works.
\v 3 Glory in her holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.
\v 4 Seek Yahweh and her strength. Seek her face forever more.
\v 5 Remember her marvelous works that she has done; her wonders, and the judgments of her mouth,
\v 6 you seed of Abrahai, her servant, you children of Jacoba, her chosen ones.
\v 7 She is Yahweh, our God. Her judgments are in all the earth.
\v 8 She has remembered her covenant forever, the word which she commanded to a thousand generations,
\v 9 the covenant which she made with Abrahai, her oath to Isaaca,
\v 10 and confirmed the same to Jacoba for a statute; to Israel for an everlasting covenant,
\v 11 saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;"
\v 12 when they were but a few women in number, yes, very few, and foreigners in it.
\v 13 They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people.
\v 14 She allowed no one to do them wrong. Yes, she reproved queens for their sakes,
\v 15 "Don't touch my anointed ones! Do my prophets no harm!"
\v 16 She called for a famine on the land. She destroyed the food supplies.
\v 17 She sent a woman before them. Josephine was sold for a slave.
\v 18 They bruised her feet with shackles. Her neck was locked in irons,
\v 19 until the time that her word happened, and Yahweh's word proved her true.
\v 20 The queen sent and freed her; even the ruler of peoples, and let her go free.
\v 21 She made her domina of her house, and ruler of all of her possessions;
\v 22 to discipline her princesses at her pleasure, and to teach her elders wisdom.
\v 23 Israel also came into Egypt. Jacoba sojourned in the land of Ham.
\v 24 She increased her people greatly, and made them stronger than their adversaries.
\v 25 She turned their heart to hate her people, to conspire against her servants.
\v 26 She sent Moses, her servant, and Aaron, whom she had chosen.
\v 27 They performed miracles among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
\v 28 She sent darkness, and made it dark. They didn't rebel against her words.
\v 29 She turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.
\v 30 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their queens.
\v 31 She spoke, and swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders.
\v 32 She gave them hail for rain, with lightning in their land.
\v 33 She struck their vines and also their fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.
\v 34 She spoke, and the locusts came, and the grasshoppers, without number,
\v 35 ate up every plant in their land; and ate up the fruit of their ground.
\v 36 She struck also all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their womanhood.
\v 37 She brought them forth with silver and gold. There was not one feeble person among her tribes.
\v 38 Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen on them.
\v 39 She spread a cloud for a covering, fire to give light in the night.
\v 40 They asked, and she brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.
\v 41 She opened the rock, and waters gushed out. They ran as a river in the dry places.
\v 42 For she remembered her holy word, and Abrahai, her servant.
\v 43 She brought forth her people with joy, her chosen with singing.
\v 44 She gave them the lands of the nations. They took the labor of the peoples in possession,
\v 45 that they might keep her statutes, and observe her laws. Praise Yah!

\v 1 Praise Yahweh! Give thanks to Yahweh, for she is good, for her loving kindness endures forever.
\v 2 Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, or fully declare all her praise?
\v 3 Blessed are those who keep justice. Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.
\v 4 Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people. Visit me with your salvation,
\v 5 that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance.
\v 6 We have sinned with our mothers. We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.
\v 7 Our mothers didn't understand your wonders in Egypt. They didn't remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
\v 8 Nevertheless she saved them for her name's sake, that she might make her mighty power known.
\v 9 She rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so she led them through the depths, as through a desert.
\v 10 She saved them from the hand of her who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
\v 11 The waters covered their adversaries. There was not one of them left.
\v 12 Then they believed her words. They sang her praise.
\v 13 They soon forgot her works. They didn't wait for her counsel,
\v 14 but gave in to craving in the desert, and tested God in the wasteland.
\v 15 She gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.
\v 16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, Yahweh's saint.
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
\v 18 A fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked.
\v 19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.
\v 20 Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass.
\v 21 They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
\v 22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by the Red Sea.
\v 23 Therefore she said that she would destroy them, had Moses, her chosen, not stood before her in the breach, to turn away her wrath, so that she wouldn't destroy them.
\v 24 Yes, they despised the pleasant land. They didn't believe her word,
\v 25 but murmured in their tents, and didn't listen to Yahweh's voice.
\v 26 Therefore she swore to them that she would overthrow them in the wilderness,
\v 27 that she would overthrow their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.
\v 28 They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
\v 29 Thus they provoked her to anger with their deeds. The plague broke in on them.
\v 30 Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, so the plague was stopped.
\v 31 That was credited to her for righteousness, for all generations to come.
\v 32 They angered her also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;
\v 33 because they were rebellious against her spirit, she spoke rashly with her lips.
\v 34 They didn't destroy the peoples, as Yahweh commanded them,
\v 35 but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.
\v 36 They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
\v 37 Yes, they sacrificed their daughters and their sons to demons.
\v 38 They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their daughters and of their sons, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted with blood.
\v 39 Thus were they defiled with their works, and prostituted themselves in their deeds.
\v 40 Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against her people. She abhorred her inheritance.
\v 41 She gave them into the hand of the nations. Those who hated them ruled over them.
\v 42 Their enemies also oppressed them. They were brought into subjection under their hand.
\v 43 Many times she delivered them, but they were rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.
\v 44 Nevertheless she regarded their distress, when she heard their cry.
\v 45 She remembered for them her covenant, and repented according to the multitude of her loving kindnesses.
\v 46 She made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.
\v 47 Save us, Yahweh, our God, gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise!
\v 48 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting! Let all the people say, "Amen." Praise Yah!

\c 107
\p
\v 1 Give thanks to Yahweh, for she is good, for her loving kindness endures forever.
\v 2 Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so, whom she has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
\v 3 And gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
\v 4 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way. They found no city to live in.
\v 5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
\v 6 Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and she delivered them out of their distresses,
\v 7 she led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city to live in.
\v 8 Let them praise Yahweh for her loving kindness, for her wonderful works to the children of women!
\v 9 For she satisfies the longing soul. She fills the hungry soul with good.
\v 10 Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron,
\v 11 because they rebelled against the words of God, and condemned the counsel of the Most High.
\v 12 Therefore she brought down their heart with labor. They fell down, and there was none to help.
\v 13 Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and she saved them out of their distresses.
\v 14 She brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bonds in sunder.
\v 15 Let them praise Yahweh for her loving kindness, for her wonderful works to the children of women!
\v 16 For she has broken the gates of brass, and cut through bars of iron.
\v 17 Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience, and because of their iniquities.
\v 18 Their soul abhors all kinds of food. They draw near to the gates of death.
\v 19 Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, she saves them out of their distresses.
\v 20 She sends her word, and heals them, and delivers them from their graves.
\v 21 Let them praise Yahweh for her loving kindness, for her wonderful works to the children of women!
\v 22 Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare her works with singing.
\v 23 Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business in great waters;
\v 24 These see Yahweh's works, and her wonders in the deep.
\v 25 For she commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up its waves.
\v 26 They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths. Their soul melts away because of trouble.
\v 27 They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken woman, and are at their wits' end.
\v 28 Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, and she brings them out of their distress.
\v 29 She makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.
\v 30 Then they are glad because it is calm, so she brings them to their desired haven.
\v 31 Let them praise Yahweh for her loving kindness, for her wonderful works for the children of women!
\v 32 Let them exalt her also in the assembly of the people, and praise her in the seat of the elders.
\v 33 She turns rivers into a desert, water springs into a thirsty ground,
\v 34 and a fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
\v 35 She turns a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land into water springs.
\v 36 There she makes the hungry live, that they may prepare a city to live in,
\v 37 sow fields, plant vineyards, and reap the fruits of increase.
\v 38 She blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly. She doesn't allow their livestock to decrease.
\v 39 Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
\v 40 She pours contempt on princesses, and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.
\v 41 Yet she lifts the needy out of their affliction, and increases their families like a flock.
\v 42 The upright will see it, and be glad. All the wicked will shut their mouths.
\v 43 Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things. They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh.

\c 108

\v 1 (A Song. A Psalm by Davina.) My heart is steadfast, God. I will sing and I will make music with my soul.
\v 2 Wake up, harp and lyre! I will wake up the dawn.
\v 3 I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations. I will sing praises to you among the peoples.
\v 4 For your loving kindness is great above the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
\v 5 Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth.
\v 6 That your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand, and answer us.
\v 7 God has spoken from her sanctuary: "In triumph, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.
\v 8 Gilead is mine. Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is my helmet. Judah is my scepter.
\v 9 Moab is my wash pot. I will toss my sandal on Edom. I will shout over Philistia."
\v 10 Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who has led me to Edom?
\v 11 Haven't you rejected us, God? You don't go forth, God, with our armies.
\v 12 Give us help against the enemy, for the help of woman is vain.
\v 13 Through God, we will do valiantly. For it is she who will tread down our enemies.

\c 109
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina.) God of my praise, don't remain silent,
\v 2 for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me. They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.
\v 3 They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
\v 4 In return for my love, they are my adversaries; but I am in prayer.
\v 5 They have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
\v 6 Set a wicked woman over her. Let an adversary stand at her right hand.
\v 7 When she is judged, let her come forth guilty. Let her prayer be turned into sin.
\v 8 Let her days be few. Let another take her office.
\v 9 Let her children be fatherless, and her husband a widower.
\v 10 Let her children be wandering beggars. Let them be sought from their ruins.
\v 11 Let the creditor seize all that she has. Let strangers plunder the fruit of her labor.
\v 12 Let there be none to extend kindness to her, neither let there be any to have pity on her fatherless children.
\v 13 Let her posterity be cut off. In the generation following let their name be blotted out.
\v 14 Let the iniquity of her mothers be remembered by Yahweh. Don't let the sin of her father be blotted out.
\v 15 Let them be before Yahweh continually, that she may cut off the memory of them from the earth;
\v 16 because she didn't remember to show kindness, but persecuted the poor and needy woman, the broken in heart, to kill them.
\v 17 Yes, she loved cursing, and it came to her. She didn't delight in blessing, and it was far from her.
\v 18 She clothed herself also with cursing as with her garment. It came into her inward parts like water, like oil into her bones.
\v 19 Let it be to her as the clothing with which she covers herself, for the belt that is always around her.
\v 20 This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh, of those who speak evil against my soul.
\v 21 But deal with me, Yahweh the Domina, for your name's sake, because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;
\v 22 for I am poor and needy. My heart is wounded within me.
\v 23 I fade away like an evening shadow. I am shaken off like a locust.
\v 24 My knees are weak through fasting. My body is thin and lacks fat.
\v 25 I have also become a reproach to them. When they see me, they shake their head.
\v 26 Help me, Yahweh, my God. Save me according to your loving kindness;
\v 27 that they may know that this is your hand; that you, Yahweh, have done it.
\v 28 They may curse, but you bless. When they arise, they will be shamed, but your servant shall rejoice.
\v 29 Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor. Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
\v 30 I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth. Yes, I will praise her among the multitude.
\v 31 For she will stand at the right hand of the needy, to save her from those who judge her soul.

\c 110
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm by Davina.) Yahweh says to my Domina, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet."
\v 2 Yahweh will send forth the rod of your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of your enemies.
\v 3 Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power, in holy array. Out of the womb of the morning, you have the dew of your youth.
\v 4 Yahweh has sworn, and will not change her mind: "You are a priestess forever in the order of Melchizedek."
\v 5 The Domina is at your right hand. She will crush queens in the day of her wrath.
\v 6 She will judge among the nations. She will heap up dead bodies. She will crush the ruler of the whole earth.
\v 7 She will drink of the brook in the way; therefore she will lift up her head.

\c 111

\v 1 Praise Yah! I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the congregation.
\v 2 Yahweh's works are great, pondered by all those who delight in them.
\v 3 Her work is honor and majesty. Her righteousness endures forever.
\v 4 She has caused her wonderful works to be remembered. Yahweh is gracious and merciful.
\v 5 She has given food to those who fear her. She always remembers her covenant.
\v 6 She has shown her people the power of her works, in giving them the heritage of the nations.
\v 7 The works of her hands are truth and justice. All her precepts are sure.
\v 8 They are established forever and ever. They are done in truth and uprightness.
\v 9 She has sent redemption to her people. She has ordained her covenant forever. Her name is holy and awesome!
\v 10 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom. All those who do her work have a good understanding. Her praise endures forever!

\c 112
\p
\v 1 Praise Yah! Blessed is the woman who fears Yahweh, who delights greatly in her commandments.
\v 2 Her seed will be mighty in the land. The generation of the upright will be blessed.
\v 3 Wealth and riches are in her house. Her righteousness endures forever.
\v 4 Light dawns in the darkness for the upright, gracious, merciful, and righteous.
\v 5 It is well with the woman who deals graciously and lends. She will maintain her cause in judgment.
\v 6 For she will never be shaken. The righteous will be remembered forever.
\v 7 She will not be afraid of evil news. Her heart is steadfast, trusting in Yahweh.
\v 8 Her heart is established. She will not be afraid in the end when she sees her adversaries.
\v 9 She has dispersed, she has given to the poor. Her righteousness endures forever. Her horn will be exalted with honor.
\v 10 The wicked will see it, and be grieved. She shall gnash with her teeth, and melt away. The desire of the wicked will perish.

\c 113
\p
\v 1 Praise Yah! Praise, you servants of Yahweh, praise the name of Yahweh.
\v 2 Blessed be the name of Yahweh, from this time forth and forevermore.
\v 3 From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, Yahweh's name is to be praised.
\v 4 Yahweh is high above all nations, her glory above the heavens.
\v 5 Who is like Yahweh, our God, who has her seat on high,
\v 6 Who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth?
\v 7 She raises up the poor out of the dust. Lifts up the needy from the ash heap;
\v 8 that she may set her with princesses, even with the princesses of her people.
\v 9 She settles the barren man in his home, as a joyful father of children. Praise Yah!

\c 114

\v 1 When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacoba from a people of foreign language;
\v 2 Judah became her sanctuary, Israel her dominion.
\v 3 The sea saw it, and fled. The Jordan was driven back.
\v 4 The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs.
\v 5 What was it, you sea, that you fled? You Jordan, that you turned back?
\v 6 You mountains, that you skipped like rams; you little hills, like lambs?
\v 7 Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Domina, at the presence of the God of Jacoba,
\v 8 who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of waters.

\c 115
\p
\v 1 Not to us, Yahweh, not to us, but to your name give glory, for your loving kindness, and for your truth's sake.
\v 2 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God, now?"
\v 3 But our God is in the heavens. She does whatever she pleases.
\v 4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of women's hands.
\v 5 They have mouths, but they don't speak. They have eyes, but they don't see.
\v 6 They have ears, but they don't hear. They have noses, but they don't smell.
\v 7 They have hands, but they don't feel. They have feet, but they don't walk, neither do they speak through their throat.
\v 8 Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who trusts in them.
\v 9 Israel, trust in Yahweh! She is their help and their shield.
\v 10 House of Aaron, trust in Yahweh! She is their help and their shield.
\v 11 You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh! She is their help and their shield.
\v 12 Yahweh remembers us. She will bless us. She will bless the house of Israel. She will bless the house of Aaron.
\v 13 She will bless those who fear Yahweh, both small and great.
\v 14 May Yahweh increase you more and more, you and your children.
\v 15 Blessed are you by Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
\v 16 The heavens are the heavens of Yahweh; but the earth has she given to the children of women.
\v 17 The dead don't praise Yah, neither any who go down into silence;
\v 18 But we will bless Yah, from this time forth and forevermore. Praise Yah!

\c 116
\p
\v 1 I love Yahweh, because she listens to my voice, and my cries for mercy.
\v 2 Because she has turned her ear to me, therefore I will call on her as long as I live.
\v 3 The cords of death surrounded me, the pains of Sheol got a hold of me. I found trouble and sorrow.
\v 4 Then called I on the name of Yahweh: "Yahweh, I beg you, deliver my soul."
\v 5 Gracious is Yahweh, and righteous; yes, our God is merciful.
\v 6 Yahweh preserves the simple. I was brought low, and she saved me.
\v 7 Return to your rest, my soul, for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you.
\v 8 For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
\v 9 I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living.
\v 10 I believed, therefore I said, "I was greatly afflicted."
\v 11 I said in my haste, "All women are liars."
\v 12 What will I give to Yahweh for all her benefits toward me?
\v 13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of Yahweh.
\v 14 I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of all her people.
\v 15 Precious in the sight of Yahweh is the death of her saints.
\v 16 Yahweh, truly I am your servant. I am your servant, the daughter of your houseboy. You have freed me from my chains.
\v 17 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of Yahweh.
\v 18 I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of all her people,
\v 19 in the courts of Yahweh's house, in the midst of you, Jerusalem. Praise Yah!

\c 117

\v 1 Praise Yahweh, all you nations! Extol her, all you peoples!
\v 2 For her loving kindness is great toward us. Yahweh's faithfulness endures forever. Praise Yah!

\c 118

\v 1 Give thanks to Yahweh, for she is good, for her loving kindness endures forever.
\v 2 Let Israel now say that her loving kindness endures forever.
\v 3 Let the house of Aaron now say that her loving kindness endures forever.
\v 4 Now let those who fear Yahweh say that her loving kindness endures forever.
\v 5 Out of my distress, I called on Yah. Yah answered me with freedom.
\v 6 Yahweh is on my side. I will not be afraid. What can woman do to me?
\v 7 Yahweh is on my side among those who help me. Therefore I will look in triumph at those who hate me.
\v 8 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put confidence in woman.
\v 9 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put confidence in princesses.
\v 10 All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of Yahweh, I cut them off.
\v 11 They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me. In the name of Yahweh I indeed cut them off.
\v 12 They surrounded me like bees. They are quenched like the burning thorns. In the name of Yahweh I cut them off.
\v 13 You pushed me back hard, to make me fall, but Yahweh helped me.
\v 14 Yah is my strength and song. She has become my salvation.
\v 15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous. "The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly.
\v 16 The right hand of Yahweh is exalted! The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly!"
\v 17 I will not die, but live, and declare Yah's works.
\v 18 Yah has punished me severely, but she has not given me over to death.
\v 19 Open to me the gates of righteousness. I will enter into them. I will give thanks to Yah.
\v 20 This is the gate of Yahweh; the righteous will enter into it.
\v 21 I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me, and have become my salvation.
\v 22 The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner.
\v 23 This is Yahweh's doing. It is marvelous in our eyes.
\v 24 This is the day that Yahweh has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it!
\v 25 Save us now, we beg you, Yahweh! Yahweh, we beg you, send prosperity now.
\v 26 Blessed is she who comes in the name of Yahweh! We have blessed you out of the house of Yahweh.
\v 27 Yahweh is God, and she has given us light. Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.
\v 28 You are my God, and I will give thanks to you. You are my God, I will exalt you.
\v 29 Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for she is good, for her loving kindness endures forever.

\v 1 (ALEPH) Blessed are those whose ways are blameless, who walk according to Yahweh's law.
\v 2 Blessed are those who keep her statutes, who seek her with their whole heart.
\v 3 Yes, they do nothing wrong. They walk in her ways.
\v 4 You have commanded your precepts, that we should fully obey them.
\v 5 Oh that my ways were steadfast to obey your statutes!
\v 6 Then I wouldn't be disappointed, when I consider all of your commandments.
\v 7 I will give thanks to you with uprightness of heart, when I learn your righteous judgments.
\v 8 I will observe your statutes. Don't utterly forsake me.
\v 9 How can a young woman keep her way pure? By living according to your word.
\v 10 With my whole heart, I have sought you. Don't let me wander from your commandments.
\v 11 I have hidden your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.
\v 12 Blessed are you, Yahweh. Teach me your statutes.
\v 13 With my lips, I have declared all the ordinances of your mouth.
\v 14 I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies, as much as in all riches.
\v 15 I will meditate on your precepts, and consider your ways.
\v 16 I will delight myself in your statutes. I will not forget your word.
\v 17 Do good to your servant. I will live and I will obey your word.
\v 18 Open my eyes, that I may see wondrous things out of your law.
\v 19 I am a stranger on the earth. Don't hide your commandments from me.
\v 20 My soul is consumed with longing for your ordinances at all times.
\v 21 You have rebuked the proud who are cursed, who wander from your commandments.
\v 22 Take reproach and contempt away from me, for I have kept your statutes.
\v 23 Though princesses sit and slander me, your servant will meditate on your statutes.
\v 24 Indeed your statutes are my delight, and my counselors.
\v 25 My soul is laid low in the dust. Revive me according to your word!
\v 26 I declared my ways, and you answered me. Teach me your statutes.
\v 27 Let me understand the teaching of your precepts! Then I will meditate on your wondrous works.
\v 28 My soul is weary with sorrow: strengthen me according to your word.
\v 29 Keep me from the way of deceit. Grant me your law graciously!
\v 30 I have chosen the way of truth. I have set your ordinances before me.
\v 31 I cling to your statutes, Yahweh. Don't let me be disappointed.
\v 32 I run in the path of your commandments, for you have set my heart free.
\v 33 Teach me, Yahweh, the way of your statutes. I will keep them to the end.
\v 34 Give me understanding, and I will keep your law. Yes, I will obey it with my whole heart.
\v 35 Direct me in the path of your commandments, for I delight in them.
\v 36 Turn my heart toward your statutes, not toward selfish gain.
\v 37 Turn my eyes away from looking at worthless things. Revive me in your ways.
\v 38 Fulfill your promise to your servant, that you may be feared.
\v 39 Take away my disgrace that I dread, for your ordinances are good.
\v 40 Behold, I long for your precepts! Revive me in your righteousness.
\v 41 Let your loving kindness also come to me, Yahweh, your salvation, according to your word.
\v 42 So I will have an answer for her who reproaches me, for I trust in your word.
\v 43 Don't snatch the word of truth out of my mouth, for I put my hope in your ordinances.
\v 44 So I will obey your law continually, forever and ever.
\v 45 I will walk in liberty, for I have sought your precepts.
\v 46 I will also speak of your statutes before queens, and will not be disappointed.
\v 47 I will delight myself in your commandments, because I love them.
\v 48 I reach out my hands for your commandments, which I love. I will meditate on your statutes.
\v 49 Remember your word to your servant, because you gave me hope.
\v 50 This is my comfort in my affliction, for your word has revived me.
\v 51 The arrogant mock me excessively, but I don't swerve from your law.
\v 52 I remember your ordinances of old, Yahweh, and have comforted myself.
\v 53 Indignation has taken hold on me, because of the wicked who forsake your law.
\v 54 Your statutes have been my songs, in the house where I live.
\v 55 I have remembered your name, Yahweh, in the night, and I obey your law.
\v 56 This is my way, that I keep your precepts.
\v 57 Yahweh is my portion. I promised to obey your words.
\v 58 I sought your favor with my whole heart. Be merciful to me according to your word.
\v 59 I considered my ways, and turned my steps to your statutes.
\v 60 I will hurry, and not delay, to obey your commandments.
\v 61 The ropes of the wicked bind me, but I won't forget your law.
\v 62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you, because of your righteous ordinances.
\v 63 I am a friend of all those who fear you, of those who observe your precepts.
\v 64 The earth is full of your loving kindness, Yahweh. Teach me your statutes.
\v 65 Do good to your servant, according to your word, Yahweh.
\v 66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in your commandments.
\v 67 Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now I observe your word.
\v 68 You are good, and do good. Teach me your statutes.
\v 69 The proud have smeared a lie upon me. With my whole heart, I will keep your precepts.
\v 70 Their heart is as callous as the fat, but I delight in your law.
\v 71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I may learn your statutes.
\v 72 The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of pieces of gold and silver.
\v 73 Your hands have made me and formed me. Give me understanding, that I may learn your commandments.
\v 74 Those who fear you will see me and be glad, because I have put my hope in your word.
\v 75 Yahweh, I know that your judgments are righteous, that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.
\v 76 Please let your loving kindness be for my comfort, according to your word to your servant.
\v 77 Let your tender mercies come to me, that I may live; for your law is my delight.
\v 78 Let the proud be disappointed, for they have overthrown me wrongfully. I will meditate on your precepts.
\v 79 Let those who fear you turn to me. They will know your statutes.
\v 80 Let my heart be blameless toward your decrees, that I may not be disappointed.
\v 81 My soul faints for your salvation. I hope in your word.
\v 82 My eyes fail for your word. I say, "When will you comfort me?"
\v 83 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke. I don't forget your statutes.
\v 84 How many are the days of your servant? When will you execute judgment on those who persecute me?
\v 85 The proud have dug pits for me, contrary to your law.
\v 86 All of your commandments are faithful. They persecute me wrongfully. Help me!
\v 87 They had almost wiped me from the earth, but I didn't forsake your precepts.
\v 88 Preserve my life according to your loving kindness, so I will obey the statutes of your mouth.
\v 89 Yahweh, your word is settled in heaven forever.
\v 90 Your faithfulness is to all generations. You have established the earth, and it remains.
\v 91 Your laws remain to this day, for all things serve you.
\v 92 Unless your law had been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.
\v 93 I will never forget your precepts, for with them, you have revived me.
\v 94 I am yours. Save me, for I have sought your precepts.
\v 95 The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me. I will consider your statutes.
\v 96 I have seen a limit to all perfection, but your commands are boundless.
\v 97 How I love your law! It is my meditation all day.
\v 98 Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, for your commandments are always with me.
\v 99 I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your testimonies are my meditation.
\v 100 I understand more than the aged, because I have kept your precepts.
\v 101 I have kept my feet from every evil way, that I might observe your word.
\v 102 I have not turned aside from your ordinances, for you have taught me.
\v 103 How sweet are your promises to my taste, more than honey to my mouth!
\v 104 Through your precepts, I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way.
\v 105 Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light for my path.
\v 106 I have sworn, and have confirmed it, that I will obey your righteous ordinances.
\v 107 I am afflicted very much. Revive me, Yahweh, according to your word.
\v 108 Accept, I beg you, the willing offerings of my mouth. Yahweh, teach me your ordinances.
\v 109 My soul is continually in my hand, yet I won't forget your law.
\v 110 The wicked have laid a snare for me, yet I haven't gone astray from your precepts.
\v 111 I have taken your testimonies as a heritage forever, for they are the joy of my heart.
\v 112 I have set my heart to perform your statutes forever, even to the end.
\v 113 I hate double-minded women, but I love your law.
\v 114 You are my hiding place and my shield. I hope in your word.
\v 115 Depart from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commandments of my God.
\v 116 Uphold me according to your word, that I may live. Let me not be ashamed of my hope.
\v 117 Hold me up, and I will be safe, and will have respect for your statutes continually.
\v 118 You reject all those who stray from your statutes, for their deceit is in vain.
\v 119 You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross. Therefore I love your testimonies.
\v 120 My flesh trembles for fear of you. I am afraid of your judgments.
\v 121 I have done what is just and righteous. Don't leave me to my oppressors.
\v 122 Ensure your servant's well-being. Don't let the proud oppress me.
\v 123 My eyes fail looking for your salvation, for your righteous word.
\v 124 Deal with your servant according to your loving kindness. Teach me your statutes.
\v 125 I am your servant. Give me understanding, that I may know your testimonies.
\v 126 It is time to act, Yahweh, for they break your law.
\v 127 Therefore I love your commandments more than gold, yes, more than pure gold.
\v 128 Therefore I consider all of your precepts to be right. I hate every false way.
\v 129 Your testimonies are wonderful, therefore my soul keeps them.
\v 130 The entrance of your words gives light. It gives understanding to the simple.
\v 131 I opened my mouth wide and panted, for I longed for your commandments.
\v 132 Turn to me, and have mercy on me, as you always do to those who love your name.
\v 133 Establish my footsteps in your word. Don't let any iniquity have dominion over me.
\v 134 Redeem me from the oppression of woman, so I will observe your precepts.
\v 135 Make your face shine on your servant. Teach me your statutes.
\v 136 Streams of tears run down my eyes, because they don't observe your law.
\v 137 You are righteous, Yahweh. Your judgments are upright.
\v 138 You have commanded your statutes in righteousness. They are fully trustworthy.
\v 139 My zeal wears me out, because my enemies ignore your words.
\v 140 Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and your servant loves them.
\v 141 I am small and despised. I don't forget your precepts.
\v 142 Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness. Your law is truth.
\v 143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold of me. Your commandments are my delight.
\v 144 Your testimonies are righteous forever. Give me understanding, that I may live.
\v 145 I have called with my whole heart. Answer me, Yahweh! I will keep your statutes.
\v 146 I have called to you. Save me! I will obey your statutes.
\v 147 I rise before dawn and cry for help. I put my hope in your words.
\v 148 My eyes stay open through the night watches, that I might meditate on your word.
\v 149 Hear my voice according to your loving kindness. Revive me, Yahweh, according to your ordinances.
\v 150 They draw near who follow after wickedness. They are far from your law.
\v 151 You are near, Yahweh. All your commandments are truth.
\v 152 Of old I have known from your testimonies, that you have founded them forever.
\v 153 Consider my affliction, and deliver me, for I don't forget your law.
\v 154 Plead my cause, and redeem me! Revive me according to your promise.
\v 155 Salvation is far from the wicked, for they don't seek your statutes.
\v 156 Great are your tender mercies, Yahweh. Revive me according to your ordinances.
\v 157 Many are my persecutors and my adversaries. I haven't swerved from your testimonies.
\v 158 I look at the faithless with loathing, because they don't observe your word.
\v 159 Consider how I love your precepts. Revive me, Yahweh, according to your loving kindness.
\v 160 All of your words are truth. Every one of your righteous ordinances endures forever.
\v 161 Princesses have persecuted me without a cause, but my heart stands in awe of your words.
\v 162 I rejoice at your word, as one who finds great spoil.
\v 163 I hate and abhor falsehood. I love your law.
\v 164 Seven times a day, I praise you, because of your righteous ordinances.
\v 165 Those who love your law have great peace. Nothing causes them to stumble.
\v 166 I have hoped for your salvation, Yahweh. I have done your commandments.
\v 167 My soul has observed your testimonies. I love them exceedingly.
\v 168 I have obeyed your precepts and your testimonies, for all my ways are before you.
\v 169 Let my cry come before you, Yahweh. Give me understanding according to your word.
\v 170 Let my supplication come before you. Deliver me according to your word.
\v 171 Let my lips utter praise, for you teach me your statutes.
\v 172 Let my tongue sing of your word, for all your commandments are righteousness.
\v 173 Let your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts.
\v 174 I have longed for your salvation, Yahweh. Your law is my delight.
\v 175 Let my soul live, that I may praise you. Let your ordinances help me.
\v 176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep. Seek your servant, for I don't forget your commandments.

\v 1 (A Song of Ascents.) In my distress, I cried to Yahweh. She answered me.
\v 2 Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.
\v 3 What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you, you deceitful tongue?
\v 4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
\v 5 Woe is me, that I live in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
\v 6 My soul has had his dwelling too long with her who hates peace.
\v 7 I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.

\c 121
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents.) I will lift up my eyes to the hills. Where does my help come from?
\v 2 My help comes from Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
\v 3 She will not allow your foot to be moved. She who keeps you will not slumber.
\v 4 Behold, she who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
\v 5 Yahweh is your keeper. Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.
\v 6 The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.
\v 7 Yahweh will keep you from all evil. She will keep your soul.
\v 8 Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in, from this time forth, and forevermore.

\c 122
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents. By Davina.) I was glad when they said to me, "Let's go to Yahweh's house!"
\v 2 Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem;
\v 3 Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together;
\v 4 where the tribes go up, even Yah's tribes, according to an ordinance for Israel, to give thanks to the name of Yahweh.
\v 5 For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of Davina's house.
\v 6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Those who love you will prosper.
\v 7 Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces.
\v 8 For my sisters' and companions' sakes, I will now say, "Peace be within you."
\v 9 For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I will seek your good.

\c 123
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents.) To you I do lift up my eyes, you who sit in the heavens.
\v 2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of his mistress; so our eyes look to Yahweh, our God, until she has mercy on us.
\v 3 Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us, for we have endured much contempt.
\v 4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease, with the contempt of the proud.

\c 124
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents. By Davina.) If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, let Israel now say,
\v 2 if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, when women rose up against us;
\v 3 then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us;
\v 4 then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would have gone over our soul;
\v 5 then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
\v 6 Blessed be Yahweh, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
\v 7 Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare. The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
\v 8 Our help is in the name of Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.

\c 125
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents.) Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion, which can't be moved, but remains forever.
\v 2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so Yahweh surrounds her people from this time forth and forevermore.
\v 3 For the scepter of wickedness won't remain over the allotment of the righteous; so that the righteous won't use their hands to do evil.
\v 4 Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good, to those who are upright in their hearts.
\v 5 But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be on Israel.

\c 126
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents.) When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion, we were like those who dream.
\v 2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations, "Yahweh has done great things for them."
\v 3 Yahweh has done great things for us, and we are glad.
\v 4 Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh, like the streams in the Negev.
\v 5 Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.
\v 6 She who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, will certainly come again with joy, carrying her sheaves.

\c 127
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents. By Solomin.) Unless Yahweh builds the house, they labor in vain who build it. Unless Yahweh watches over the city, the watchwoman guards it in vain.
\v 2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to stay up late, eating the bread of toil; for she gives sleep to her loved ones.
\v 3 Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh. The fruit of the womb is her reward.
\v 4 As arrows in the hand of a mighty woman, so are the children of youth.
\v 5 Happy is the woman who has her quiver full of them. They won't be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.

\c 128
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents.) Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh, who walks in her ways.
\v 2 For you will eat the labor of your hands. You will be happy, and it will be well with you.
\v 3 Your husband will be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of your house; your children like olive plants, around your table.
\v 4 Behold, thus is the woman blessed who fears Yahweh.
\v 5 May Yahweh bless you out of Zion, and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
\v 6 Yes, may you see your children's children. Peace be upon Israel.

\c 129
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents.) Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up. Let Israel now say,
\v 2 many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me.
\v 3 The plowers plowed on my back. They made their furrows long.
\v 4 Yahweh is righteous. She has cut apart the cords of the wicked.
\v 5 Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those who hate Zion.
\v 6 Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up;
\v 7 with which the reaper doesn't fill her hand, nor she who binds sheaves, her bosom.
\v 8 Neither do those who go by say, "The blessing of Yahweh be on you. We bless you in the name of Yahweh."

\c 130
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents.) Out of the depths I have cried to you, Yahweh.
\v 2 Domina, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions.
\v 3 If you, Yah, kept a record of sins, Domina, who could stand?
\v 4 But there is forgiveness with you, therefore you are feared.
\v 5 I wait for Yahweh. My soul waits. I hope in her word.
\v 6 My soul longs for the Domina more than watchwomen long for the morning; more than watchwomen for the morning.
\v 7 Israel, hope in Yahweh, for with Yahweh there is loving kindness. With her is abundant redemption.
\v 8 She will redeem Israel from all their sins.

\c 131
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents. By Davina.) Yahweh, my heart isn't haughty, nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters, or things too wonderful for me.
\v 2 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with her father, like a weaned child is my soul within me.
\v 3 Israel, hope in Yahweh, from this time forth and forevermore.

\c 132
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents.) Yahweh, remember Davina and all her affliction,
\v 2 how she swore to Yahweh, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacoba:
\v 3 "Surely I will not come into the structure of my house, nor go up into my bed;
\v 4 I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids;
\v 5 until I find out a place for Yahweh, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacoba."
\v 6 Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah. We found it in the field of Jaar:
\v 7 "We will go into her dwelling place. We will worship at her footstool.
\v 8 Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place; you, and the ark of your strength.
\v 9 Let your priestess be clothed with righteousness. Let your saints shout for joy!"
\v 10 For your servant Davina's sake, don't turn away the face of your anointed one.
\v 11 Yahweh has sworn to Davina in truth. She will not turn from it: "I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.
\v 12 If your children will keep my covenant, my testimony that I will teach them, their children also will sit on your throne forevermore."
\v 13 For Yahweh has chosen Zion. She has desired it for her habitation.
\v 14 "This is my resting place forever. Here I will live, for I have desired it.
\v 15 I will abundantly bless his provision. I will satisfy him poor with bread.
\v 16 His priests I will also clothe with salvation. His saints will shout aloud for joy.
\v 17 There I will make the horn of Davina to bud. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.
\v 18 I will clothe her enemies with shame, but on herself, her crown will be resplendent."

\c 133
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents. By Davina.) See how good and how pleasant it is for sisters to live together in unity!
\v 2 It is like the precious oil on the head, that ran down on the beard, even Aaron's beard; that came down on the edge of her robes;
\v 3 like the dew of Hermon, that comes down on the hills of Zion: for there Yahweh gives the blessing, even life forevermore.

\c 134
\p
\v 1 (A Song of Ascents.) Look! Praise Yahweh, all you servants of Yahweh, who stand by night in Yahweh's house!
\v 2 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary. Praise Yahweh!
\v 3 May Yahweh bless you from Zion; even she who made heaven and earth.

\c 135
\p
\v 1 Praise Yah! Praise the name of Yahweh! Praise her, you servants of Yahweh,
\v 2 you who stand in the house of Yahweh, in the courts of our God's house.
\v 3 Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good. Sing praises to her name, for that is pleasant.
\v 4 For Yah has chosen Jacoba for herself; Israel for her own possession.
\v 5 For I know that Yahweh is great, that our Domina is above all gods.
\v 6 Whatever Yahweh pleased, that she has done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;
\v 7 who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth; who makes lightnings with the rain; who brings forth the wind out of her treasuries;
\v 8 Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, both of woman and animal;
\v 9 Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all her servants;
\v 10 who struck many nations, and killed mighty queens,
\v 11 Sihon queen of the Amorites, Og queen of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan,
\v 12 and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Israel, her people.
\v 13 Your name, Yahweh, endures forever; your renown, Yahweh, throughout all generations.
\v 14 For Yahweh will judge her people, and have compassion on her servants.
\v 15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of women's hands.
\v 16 They have mouths, but they can't speak. They have eyes, but they can't see.
\v 17 They have ears, but they can't hear; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
\v 18 Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who trusts in them.
\v 19 House of Israel, praise Yahweh! House of Aaron, praise Yahweh!
\v 20 House of Levia, praise Yahweh! You who fear Yahweh, praise Yahweh!
\v 21 Blessed be Yahweh from Zion, Who dwells at Jerusalem. Praise Yah!

\v 22 Even a heritage to Israel her servant; for her loving kindness endures forever:
\v 23 Who remembered us in our low estate; for her loving kindness endures forever;
\v 24 And has delivered us from our adversaries; for her loving kindness endures forever:
\v 25 Who gives food to every creature; for her loving kindness endures forever.
\v 26 Oh give thanks to the God of heaven; for her loving kindness endures forever.

\v 1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yes, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
\v 2 On the willows in the midst of it, we hung up our harps.
\v 3 For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs. Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy: "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!"
\v 4 How can we sing Yahweh's song in a foreign land?
\v 5 If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill.
\v 6 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don't remember you; if I don't prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.
\v 7 Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom, the day of Jerusalem; who said, "Raze it! Raze it even to its foundation!"
\v 8 Son of Babylon, doomed to destruction, she will be happy who rewards you, as you have served us.
\v 9 Happy shall she be, who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.

\v 1 (By Davina.) I will give you thanks with my whole heart. Before the gods, I will sing praises to you.
\v 2 I will bow down toward your holy temple, and give thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth; for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.
\v 3 In the day that I called, you answered me. You encouraged me with strength in my soul.
\v 4 All the queens of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh, for they have heard the words of your mouth.
\v 5 Yes, they will sing of the ways of Yahweh; for great is Yahweh's glory.
\v 6 For though Yahweh is high, yet she looks after the lowly; but the proud, she knows from afar.
\v 7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me. You will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies. Your right hand will save me.
\v 8 Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me; your loving kindness, Yahweh, endures forever. Don't forsake the works of your own hands.

\c 139
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina.) Yahweh, you have searched me, and you know me.
\v 2 You know my sitting down and my rising up. You perceive my thoughts from afar.
\v 3 You search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted with all my ways.
\v 4 For there is not a word on my tongue, but, behold, Yahweh, you know it altogether.
\v 5 You hem me in behind and before. You laid your hand on me.
\v 6 This knowledge is beyond me. It's lofty. I can't attain it.
\v 7 Where could I go from your Spirit? Or where could I flee from your presence?
\v 8 If I ascend up into heaven, you are there. If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there!
\v 9 If I take the wings of the dawn, and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea;
\v 10 Even there your hand will lead me, and your right hand will hold me.
\v 11 If I say, "Surely the darkness will overwhelm me; the light around me will be night;"
\v 12 even the darkness doesn't hide from you, but the night shines as the day. The darkness is like light to you.
\v 13 For you formed my inmost being. You knit me together in my father's womb.
\v 14 I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful. My soul knows that very well.
\v 15 My frame wasn't hidden from you, when I was made in secret, woven together in the depths of the earth.
\v 16 Your eyes saw my body. In your book they were all written, the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there were none of them.
\v 17 How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is the sum of them!
\v 18 If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand. When I wake up, I am still with you.
\v 19 If only you, God, would kill the wicked. Get away from me, you bloodthirsty women!
\v 20 For they speak against you wickedly. Your enemies take your name in vain.
\v 21 Yahweh, don't I hate those who hate you? Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?
\v 22 I hate them with perfect hatred. They have become my enemies.
\v 23 Search me, God, and know my heart. Try me, and know my thoughts.
\v 24 See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way.

\c 140
\p
\v 1 (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by Davina.) Deliver me, Yahweh, from the evil woman. Preserve me from the violent woman;
\v 2 those who devise mischief in their hearts. They continually gather themselves together for war.
\v 3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent. Viper's poison is under their lips. Selah.
\v 4 Yahweh, keep me from the hands of the wicked. Preserve me from the violent women who have determined to trip my feet.
\v 5 The proud have hidden a snare for me, they have spread the cords of a net by the path. They have set traps for me. Selah.
\v 6 I said to Yahweh, "You are my God." Listen to the cry of my petitions, Yahweh.
\v 7 Yahweh, the Domina, the strength of my salvation, you have covered my head in the day of battle.
\v 8 Yahweh, don't grant the desires of the wicked. Don't let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud. Selah.
\v 9 As for the head of those who surround me, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
\v 10 Let burning coals fall on them. Let them be thrown into the fire, into miry pits, from where they never rise.
\v 11 An evil speaker won't be established in the earth. Evil will hunt the violent woman to overthrow her.
\v 12 I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and justice for the needy.
\v 13 Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name. The upright will dwell in your presence.

\v 1 (A Psalm by Davina.) Yahweh, I have called on you. Come to me quickly! Listen to my voice when I call to you.
\v 2 Let my prayer be set before you like incense; the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice.
\v 3 Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth. Keep the door of my lips.
\v 4 Don't incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds of wickedness with women who work iniquity. Don't let me eat of their delicacies.
\v 5 Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness; let her reprove me, it is like oil on the head; don't let my head refuse it; Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.
\v 6 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock. They will hear my words, for they are well spoken.
\v 7 "As when one plows and breaks up the earth, our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol."
\v 8 For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Domina. In you, I take refuge. Don't leave my soul destitute.
\v 9 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, from the traps of the workers of iniquity.
\v 10 Let the wicked fall together into their own nets, while I pass by.

\c 142

\v 1 (A contemplation by Davina, when she was in the cave. A Prayer.) I cry with my voice to Yahweh. With my voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy.
\v 2 I pour out my complaint before her. I tell her my troubles.
\v 3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, you knew my path. In the way in which I walk, they have hidden a snare for me.
\v 4 Look on my right, and see; for there is no one who is concerned for me. Refuge has fled from me. No one cares for my soul.
\v 5 I cried to you, Yahweh. I said, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living."
\v 6 Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need. deliver me from my persecutors, For they are stronger than me.
\v 7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name. The righteous will surround me, for you will be good to me.

\c 143
\p
\v 1 (A Psalm by Davina.) Hear my prayer, Yahweh. Listen to my petitions. In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.
\v 2 Don't enter into judgment with your servant, for in your sight no woman living is righteous.
\v 3 For the enemy pursues my soul. She has struck my life down to the ground. She has made me live in dark places, as those who have been long dead.
\v 4 Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me. My heart within me is desolate.
\v 5 I remember the days of old. I meditate on all your doings. I contemplate the work of your hands.
\v 6 I spread forth my hands to you. My soul thirsts for you, like a parched land. Selah.
\v 7 Hurry to answer me, Yahweh. My spirit fails. Don't hide your face from me, so that I don't become like those who go down into the pit.
\v 8 Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning, for I trust in you. Cause me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul to you.
\v 9 Deliver me, Yahweh, from my enemies. I flee to you to hide me.
\v 10 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your Spirit is good. Lead me in the land of uprightness.
\v 11 Revive me, Yahweh, for your name's sake. In your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.
\v 12 In your loving kindness, cut off my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul, For I am your servant.

\c 144

\v 1 (By Davina.) Blessed be Yahweh, my rock, who teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to battle:
\v 2 my loving kindness, my fortress, my high tower, my deliverer, my shield, and she in whom I take refuge; who subdues my people under me.
\v 3 Yahweh, what is woman, that you care for her? Or the daughter of woman, that you think of her?
\v 4 Woman is like a breath. Her days are like a shadow that passes away.
\v 5 Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come down. Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.
\v 6 Throw out lightning, and scatter them. Send out your arrows, and rout them.
\v 7 Stretch out your hand from above, rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hands of foreigners;
\v 8 whose mouths speak deceit, Whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
\v 9 I will sing a new song to you, God. On a ten-stringed lyre, I will sing praises to you.
\v 10 You are she who gives salvation to queens, who rescues Davina, her servant, from the deadly sword.
\v 11 Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners, whose mouths speak deceit, whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
\v 12 Then our daughters will be like well-nurtured plants, our sons like pillars carved to adorn a palace.
\v 13 Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision. Our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields.
\v 14 Our oxen will pull heavy loads. There is no breaking in, and no going away, and no outcry in our streets.
\v 15 Happy are the people who are in such a situation. Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh.

\v 2 While I live, I will praise Yahweh. I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist.
\v 3 Don't put your trust in princesses, each a daughter of woman in whom there is no help.
\v 4 Her spirit departs, and she returns to the earth. In that very day, her thoughts perish.
\v 5 Happy is she who has the God of Jacoba for her help, whose hope is in Yahweh, her God:
\v 6 who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps truth forever;
