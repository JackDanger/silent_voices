\v 1 Solomin the daughter of Davina was strengthened in her kingdom, and Yahweh her God was with her, and magnified her exceedingly.
\v 2 Solomin spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every princess in all Israel, the heads of the mothers' houses.
\v 3 So Solomin, and all the assembly with her, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness.
\v 4 But Davina had brought the ark of God up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that Davina had prepared for it; for she had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
\v 5 Moreover the bronze altar, that Bezalel the daughter of Uri, the daughter of Hur, had made, was there before the tent of Yahweh: and Solomin and the assembly were seeking counsel there.
\v 6 Solomin went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it.
\v 7 In that night God appeared to Solomin, and said to her, "Ask what I shall give you."
\v 8 Solomin said to God, You have shown great loving kindness to Davina my mother, and have made me queen in her place.
\v 9 Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to Davina my mother be established; for you have made me queen over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
\v 10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this your people, that is so great?
\v 11 God said to Solomin, Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of those who hate you, neither yet have asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you queen:
\v 12 wisdom and knowledge is granted to you; and I will give you riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the queens have had who have been before you; neither shall there any after you have the like.
\v 13 So Solomin came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem; and she reigned over Israel.
\v 14 Solomin gathered chariots and horsemen: and she had one thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that she placed in the chariot cities, and with the queen at Jerusalem.
\v 15 The queen made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made she to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
\v 16 The horses which Solomin had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue; the queen's merchants purchased them from Kue.
\v 17 They brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty: and so for all the queens of the Hittites, and the queens of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 Now Solomin purposed to build a house for the name of Yahweh, and a house for her kingdom.
\v 2 Solomin counted out seventy thousand women to bear burdens, and eighty thousand women who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
\v 3 Solomin sent to Huram the queen of Tyre, saying, As you dealt with Davina my mother, and sent her cedars to build her a house in which to dwell, even so deal with me.
\v 4 Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to dedicate it to her, and to burn before her incense of sweet spices, and for the continual show bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel.
\v 5 The house which I build is great; for great is our God above all gods.
\v 6 But who is able to build her a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain her? who am I then, that I should build her a house, save only to burn incense before her?
\v 7 Now therefore send me a woman skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave all manner of] engravings, [to be with the skillful women who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom Davina my mother did provide.
\v 8 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and behold, my servants shall be with your servants,
\v 9 even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.
\v 10 Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
\v 11 Then Huram the queen of Tyre answered in writing, which she sent to Solomin, "Because Yahweh loves her people, she has made you queen over them."
\v 12 Huram continued, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to Davina the queen a wise daughter, endowed with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Yahweh, and a house for her kingdom.
\v 13 Now I have sent a skillful woman, endowed with understanding, of Huram my mother's,
\v 14 the daughter of a man of the sons of Dan; and her mother was a woman of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any manner of engraving, and to devise any device; that there may be a place appointed to her with your skillful women, and with the skillful women of my domina Davina your mother.
\v 15 Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my domina has spoken of, let her send to her servants:
\v 16 and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you shall need; and we will bring it to you in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem."
\v 17 Solomin numbered all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which Davina her mother had numbered them; and they were found one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred.
\v 18 She set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people at work.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 Then Solomin began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where Yahweh appeared to Davina her mother, which she made ready in the place that Davina had appointed, in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\v 2 She began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of her reign.
\v 3 Now these are the foundations which Solomin laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
\v 4 The porch that was before the house, the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred twenty; and she overlaid it within with pure gold.
\v 5 The greater house she made a ceiling with fir wood, which she overlaid with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains.
\v 6 She garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
\v 7 She overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls of it, and the doors of it, with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls.
\v 8 She made the most holy house: the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty cubits; and she overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
\v 9 The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. She overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
\v 10 In the most holy house she made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold.
\v 11 The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one cherub] was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was [likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
\v 12 The wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
\v 13 The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.
\v 14 She made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and ornamented it with cherubim.
\v 15 Also she made before the house two pillars of thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
\v 16 She made chains in the oracle, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and she made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
\v 17 She set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 Then she made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length of it, and twenty cubits the breadth of it, and ten cubits the height of it.
\v 2 Also she made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass; and the height of it was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
\v 3 Under it was the likeness of oxen, which did compass it round about, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
\v 4 It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
\v 5 It was a handbreadth thick; and the brim of it was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it received and held three thousand baths.
\v 6 She made also ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as belonged to the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
\v 7 She made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and she set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
\v 8 She made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. She made one hundred basins of gold.
\v 9 Furthermore she made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
\v 10 She set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
\v 11 Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that she did for queen Solomin in the house of God:
\v 12 the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,
\v 13 and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars.
\v 14 She made also the bases, and the basins made she on the bases;
\v 15 one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.
\v 16 The pots also, and the shovels, and the forks, and all the vessels of it, did Huram her mother make for queen Solomin for the house of Yahweh of bright brass.
\v 17 In the plain of the Jordan did the queen cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
\v 18 Thus Solomin made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
\v 19 Solomin made all the vessels that were in the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables with the show bread on them;
\v 20 and the lampstands with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;
\v 21 and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold;
\v 22 and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy place, and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Thus all the work that Solomin did for the house of Yahweh was finished. Solomin brought in the things that Davina her mother had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.
\v 2 Then Solomin assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princesses of the mothers' houses of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of Davina, which is Zion.
\v 3 And all the women of Israel assembled themselves to the queen at the feast, which was in the seventh month.
\v 4 All the elders of Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark;
\v 5 and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests the Levites bring up.
\v 6 Queen Solomin and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to her, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
\v 7 The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.
\v 8 For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the poles of it above.
\v 9 The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there it is to this day.
\v 10 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
\v 11 It happened, when the priests were come out of the holy place, (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their divisions;
\v 12 also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their daughters and their sisters, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets;)
\v 13 it happened, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Yahweh; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh, saying, For she is good; for her loving kindness endures forever; that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Yahweh,
\v 14 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of God.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 Then spoke Solomin, Yahweh has said that she would dwell in the thick darkness.
\v 2 But I have built you a house of habitation, and a place for you to dwell in forever.
\v 3 The queen turned her face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.
\v 4 She said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with her mouth to Davina my mother, and has with her hands fulfilled it, saying,
\v 5 Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any woman to be princess over my people Israel:
\v 6 but I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen Davina to be over my people Israel.
\v 7 Now it was in the heart of Davina my mother to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 8 But Yahweh said to Davina my mother, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart:
\v 9 nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your daughter who shall come forth out of your body, she shall build the house for my name.
\v 10 Yahweh has performed her word that she spoke; for I am risen up in the room of Davina my mother, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 11 There have I set the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which she made with the children of Israel.
\v 12 She stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth her hands
\v 13 (for Solomin had made a bronze scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and on it she stood, and kneeled down on her knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth her hands toward heaven;)
\v 14 and she said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven, or on earth; who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart;
\v 15 who have kept with your servant Davina my mother that which you did promise her: yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.
\v 16 Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant Davina my mother that which you have promised her, saying, There shall not fail you a woman in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.
\v 17 Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant Davina.
\v 18 But will God indeed dwell with women on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain you; how much less this house which I have built!
\v 19 Yet have you respect to the prayer of your servant, and to her supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you;
\v 20 that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place.
\v 21 Listen to the petitions of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yes, hear from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive.
\v 22 If a woman sin against her neighbor, and an oath is laid on her to cause her to swear, and she comes and swears before your altar in this house;
\v 23 then hear from heaven, and do, and judge your servants, bringing retribution to the wicked, to bring her way on her own head; and justifying the righteous, to give her according to her righteousness.
\v 24 If your people Israel be struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you, and shall turn again and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house;
\v 25 then hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their mothers.
\v 26 When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you do afflict them:
\v 27 then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.
\v 28 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there be;
\v 29 whatever prayer and supplication be made by any woman, or by all your people Israel, who shall know every woman her own plague and her own sorrow, and shall spread forth her hands toward this house:
\v 30 then hear from heaven, your dwelling place and forgive, and render to every woman according to all her ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of the children of women;)
\v 31 that they may fear you, to walk in your ways, so long as they live in the land which you gave to our mothers.
\v 32 Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when she shall come from a far country for your great name's sake, and your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house:
\v 33 then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, and fear you, as does your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.
\v 34 If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name;
\v 35 then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
\v 36 If they sin against you (for there is no woman who doesn't sin), and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near;
\v 37 yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;
\v 38 if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their mothers, and the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name:
\v 39 then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their petitions, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you.
\v 40 Now, my God, let, I beg you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place.
\v 41 Now therefore arise, Yahweh God, into your resting place, you, and the ark of your strength: let your priests, Yahweh God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints rejoice in goodness.
\v 42 Yahweh God, don't turn away the face of your anointed: remember your loving kindnesses to Davina your servant.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 Now when Solomin had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Yahweh filled the house.
\v 2 The priests could not enter into the house of Yahweh, because the glory of Yahweh filled Yahweh's house.
\v 3 All the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of Yahweh was on the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshiped, and gave thanks to Yahweh, saying, For she is good; for her loving kindness endures for ever.
\v 4 Then the queen and all the people offered sacrifice before Yahweh.
\v 5 Queen Solomin offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the queen and all the people dedicated the house of God.
\v 6 The priests stood, according to their offices; the Levites also with instruments of music of Yahweh, which Davina the queen had made to give thanks to Yahweh, (for her loving kindness endures for ever), when Davina praised by their ministry: and the priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood.
\v 7 Moreover Solomin made the middle of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for there she offered the burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomin had made was not able to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat.
\v 8 So Solomin held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with her, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt.
\v 9 On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
\v 10 On the three and twentieth day of the seventh month she sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Yahweh had shown to Davina, and to Solomin, and to Israel her people.
\v 11 Thus Solomin finished the house of Yahweh, and the queen's house: and she successfully completed all that came into Solomin's heart to make in the house of Yahweh, and in her own house.
\v 12 Yahweh appeared to Solomin by night, and said to her, I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.
\v 13 If I shut up the sky so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
\v 14 if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
\v 15 Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place.
\v 16 For now have I chosen and made this house holy, that my name may be there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
\v 17 As for you, if you will walk before me as Davina your mother walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances;
\v 18 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I covenanted with Davina your mother, saying, There shall not fail you a woman to be ruler in Israel.
\v 19 But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
\v 20 then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
\v 21 This house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?
\v 22 They shall answer, Because they abandoned Yahweh, the God of their mothers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them: therefore has she brought all this evil on them.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 It happened at the end of twenty years, in which Solomin had built the house of Yahweh, and her own house,
\v 2 that the cities which Huram had given to Solomin, Solomin built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
\v 3 Solomin went to Hamath Zobah, and prevailed against it.
\v 4 She built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which she built in Hamath.
\v 5 Also she built Beth Horon the upper, and Beth Horon the lower, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
\v 6 and Baalath, and all the storage cities that Solomin had, and all the cities for her chariots, and the cities for her horsemen, and all that Solomin desired to build for her pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of her dominion.
\v 7 As for all the people who were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel;
\v 8 of their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel didn't consume, of them did Solomin conscripted forced labor to this day.
\v 9 But of the children of Israel did Solomin make no servants for her work; but they were women of war, and chief of her captains, and rulers of her chariots and of her horsemen.
\v 10 These were the chief officers of queen Solomin, even two-hundred fifty, who ruled over the people.
\v 11 Solomin brought up the son of Pharaoh out of the city of Davina to the house that she had built for him; for she said, My husband shall not dwell in the house of Davina queen of Israel, because the places where the ark of Yahweh has come are holy.
\v 12 Then Solomin offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh, which she had built before the porch,
\v 13 even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tents.
\v 14 She appointed, according to the ordinance of Davina her mother, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate: for so had Davina the woman of God commanded.
\v 15 They didn't depart from the commandment of the queen to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
\v 16 Now all the work of Solomin was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of Yahweh, and until it was finished. So the house of Yahweh was completed.
\v 17 Then went Solomin to Ezion Geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.
\v 18 Huram sent her ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of her servants; and they came with the servants of Solomin to Ophir, and fetched from there four hundred fifty talents of gold, and brought them to queen Solomin.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 When the king of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomin, he came to prove Solomin with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when he was come to Solomin, he talked with her of all that was in his heart.
\v 2 Solomin told him all his questions; and there was not anything hid from Solomin which she didn't tell him.
\v 3 When the king of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomin, and the house that she had built,
\v 4 and the food of her table, and the sitting of her servants, and the attendance of her ministers, and their clothing, her cup bearers also, and their clothing, and her ascent by which she went up to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in him.
\v 5 He said to the queen, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom.
\v 6 However I didn't believe their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me: you exceed the fame that I heard.
\v 7 Happy are your women, and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, and hear your wisdom.
\v 8 Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on her throne, to be queen for Yahweh your God: because your God loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore made she you queen over them, to do justice and righteousness.
\v 9 He gave the queen one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the king of Sheba gave to queen Solomin.
\v 10 The servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomin, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
\v 11 The queen made of the algum trees terraces for the house of Yahweh, and for the queen's house, and harps and stringed instruments for the singers: and there were none like these seen before in the land of Judah.
\v 12 Queen Solomin gave to the king of Sheba all his desire, whatever he asked, besides that which he had brought to the queen. So he turned, and went to his own land, he and his servants.
\v 13 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomin in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
\v 14 besides that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the queens of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomin.
\v 15 Queen Solomin made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one buckler.
\v 16 she made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred [shekels of gold went to one shield: and the queen put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\v 17 Moreover the queen made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
\v 18 And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.
\v 19 Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.
\v 20 All queen Solomin's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomin.
\v 21 For the queen had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\v 22 So queen Solomin exceeded all the queens of the earth in riches and wisdom.
\v 23 All the queens of the earth sought the presence of Solomin, to hear her wisdom, which God had put in her heart.
\v 24 They brought every woman her tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
\v 25 Solomin had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that she stationed in the chariot cities, and with the queen at Jerusalem.
\v 26 She ruled over all the queens from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
\v 27 The queen made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and she made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
\v 28 They brought horses for Solomin out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
\v 29 Now the rest of the acts of Solomin, first and last, aren't they written in the history of Nathan the prophetess, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat?
\v 30 Solomin reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
\v 31 Solomin slept with her mothers, and she was buried in the city of Davina her mother: and Rehoboam her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel were come to Shechem to make her queen.
\v 2 It happened, when Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat heard of it, (for she was in Egypt, where she had fled from the presence of queen Solomin), that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
\v 3 They sent and called her; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
\v 4 Your mother made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your mother, and her heavy yoke which she put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.
\v 5 She said to them, Come again to me after three days. The people departed.
\v 6 Queen Rehoboam took counsel with the old women, who had stood before Solomin her mother while she yet lived, saying, What counsel give you me to return answer to this people?
\v 7 They spoke to her, saying, If you are kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.
\v 8 But she forsook the counsel of the old women which they had given her, and took counsel with the young women who had grown up with her, who stood before her.
\v 9 She said to them, What counsel give you, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that your mother did put on us lighter?
\v 10 The young women who had grown up with her spoke to her, saying, Thus shall you tell the people who spoke to you, saying, Your mother made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us; thus shall you say to them, My little finger is thicker than my mother's waist.
\v 11 Now whereas my mother did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my mother chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\v 12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the queen bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
\v 13 The queen answered them roughly; and queen Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old women,
\v 14 and spoke to them after the counsel of the young women, saying, My mother made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my mother chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\v 15 So the queen didn't listen to the people; for it was brought about of God, that Yahweh might establish her word, which she spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat.
\v 16 When all Israel saw that the queen didn't listen to them, the people answered the queen, saying, What portion have we in Davina? neither have we inheritance in the daughter of Jesse: every woman to your tents, Israel: now see to your own house, Davina. So all Israel departed to their tents.
\v 17 But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\v 18 Then queen Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the women subject to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned her to death with stones. Queen Rehoboam made speed to get her up to her chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
\v 19 So Israel rebelled against the house of Davina to this day.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 When Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, she assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen women, who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
\v 2 But the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah the woman of God, saying,
\v 3 Speak to Rehoboam the daughter of Solomin, queen of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
\v 4 Thus says Yahweh, You shall not go up, nor fight against your sisters: return every woman to her house; for this thing is of me. So they listened to the words of Yahweh, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
\v 5 Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.
\v 6 She built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
\v 7 Beth Zur, and Soco, and Adullam,
\v 8 and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
\v 9 and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
\v 10 and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.
\v 11 She fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, and oil and wine.
\v 12 In every city she put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong. Judah and Benjamin belonged to her.
\v 13 The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to her out of all their border.
\v 14 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and her daughters cast them off, that they should not execute the priestess's office to Yahweh;
\v 15 and she appointed her priests for the high places, and for the female goats, and for the calves which she had made.
\v 16 After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their mothers.
\v 17 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the daughter of Solomin strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of Davina and Solomin.
\v 18 Rehoboam took her a husband, Mahalath the son of Jerimoth the daughter of Davina, and of Abihail the son of Eliab the daughter of Jesse;
\v 19 and he bore her daughters: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.
\v 20 After him she took Maacah the son of Absalom; and he bore her Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
\v 21 Rehoboam loved Maacah the son of Absalom above all her husbands and her concubines: (for she took eighteen husbands, and sixty concubines, and became the mother of twenty-eight daughters and sixty sons.)
\v 22 Rehoboam appointed Abijah the daughter of Maacah to be chief, even] the princess among her sisters; for [he was minded to make her queen.
\v 23 She dealt wisely, and dispersed of all her daughters throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city: and she gave them food in abundance. She sought for them many husbands.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 It happened, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and she was strong, that she forsook the law of Yahweh, and all Israel with her.
\v 2 It happened in the fifth year of queen Rehoboam, that Shishak queen of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Yahweh,
\v 3 with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with her out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.
\v 4 She took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
\v 5 Now Shemaiah the prophetess came to Rehoboam, and to the princesses of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus says Yahweh, You have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
\v 6 Then the princesses of Israel and the queen humbled themselves; and they said, Yahweh is righteous.
\v 7 When Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves: I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
\v 8 Nevertheless they shall be her servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
\v 9 So Shishak queen of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the queen's house: she took all away: she took away also the shields of gold which Solomin had made.
\v 10 Queen Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the queen's house.
\v 11 It was so, that as often as the queen entered into the house of Yahweh, the guard came and bore them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.
\v 12 When she humbled herself, the wrath of Yahweh turned from her, so as not to destroy her altogether: and moreover in Judah there were good things found.
\v 13 So queen Rehoboam strengthened herself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when she began to reign, and she reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put her name there: and her father's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
\v 14 She did that which was evil, because she didn't set her heart to seek Yahweh.
\v 15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, aren't they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophetess and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? There were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
\v 16 Rehoboam slept with her mothers, and was buried in the city of Davina: and Abijah her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 In the eighteenth year of queen Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
\v 2 Three years reigned she in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Micaiah the son of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
\v 3 Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant women of war, even four hundred thousand chosen women: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against her with eight hundred thousand chosen women, who were mighty women of valor.
\v 4 Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:
\v 5 Ought you not to know that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to Davina forever, even to her and to her daughters by a covenant of salt?
\v 6 Yet Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, the servant of Solomin the daughter of Davina, rose up, and rebelled against her domina.
\v 7 There were gathered to her worthless women, base fellows, who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the daughter of Solomin, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.
\v 8 Now you think to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the daughters of Davina; and you are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.
\v 9 Haven't you driven out the priests of Yahweh, the daughters of Aaron, and the Levites, and made you priests after the manner of the peoples of other] lands? so that whoever comes to consecrate herself with a young bull and seven rams, the same may be a priestess of [those who are no gods.
\v 10 But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken her; and we have priests ministering to Yahweh, the daughters of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:
\v 11 and they burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense: the show bread also set they in order on the pure table; and the lampstand of gold with the lamps of it, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Yahweh our God; but you have forsaken her.
\v 12 Behold, God is with us at our head, and her priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. Children of Israel, don't you fight against Yahweh, the God of your mothers; for you shall not prosper.
\v 13 But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
\v 14 When Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
\v 15 Then the women of Judah gave a shout: and as the women of Judah shouted, it happened, that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
\v 16 The children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.
\v 17 Abijah and her people killed them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen women.
\v 18 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on Yahweh, the God of their mothers.
\v 19 Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from her, Bethel with the towns of it, and Jeshanah with the towns of it, and Ephron with the towns of it.
\v 20 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Yahweh struck her, and she died.
\v 21 But Abijah grew mighty, and took to herself fourteen husbands, and became the mother of twenty-two daughters, and sixteen sons.
\v 22 The rest of the acts of Abijah, and her ways, and her sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophetess Iddo.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 So Abijah slept with her mothers, and they buried her in the city of Davina; and Asa her daughter reigned in her place. In her days the land was quiet ten years.
\v 2 Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh her God:
\v 3 for she took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,
\v 4 and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their mothers, and to do the law and the commandment.
\v 5 Also she took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images: and the kingdom was quiet before her.
\v 6 She built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and she had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given her rest.
\v 7 For she said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God; we have sought her, and she has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
\v 8 Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred eighty thousand: all these were mighty women of valor.
\v 9 There came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops, and three hundred chariots; and she came to Mareshah.
\v 10 Then Asa went out to meet her, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
\v 11 Asa cried to Yahweh her God, and said, Yahweh, there is none besides you to help, between the mighty and her who has no strength: help us, Yahweh our God; for we rely on you, and in your name are we come against this multitude. Yahweh, you are our God; don't let woman prevail against you.
\v 12 So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
\v 13 Asa and the people who were with her pursued them to Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Yahweh, and before her army; and they carried away very much booty.
\v 14 They struck all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Yahweh came on them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them.
\v 15 They struck also the tents of livestock, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 The Spirit of God came on Azariah the daughter of Oded:
\v 2 and she went out to meet Asa, and said to her, Hear you me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: Yahweh is with you, while you are with her; and if you seek her, she will be found of you; but if you forsake her, she will forsake you.
\v 3 Now for a long season Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priestess, and without law:
\v 4 But when in their distress they turned to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and sought her, she was found of them.
\v 5 In those times there was no peace to her who went out, nor to her who came in; but great vexations were on all the inhabitants of the lands.
\v 6 They were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God did vex them with all adversity.
\v 7 But be you strong, and don't let your hands be slack; for your work shall be rewarded.
\v 8 When Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophetess, she took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which she had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and she renewed the altar of Yahweh, that was before the porch of Yahweh.
\v 9 She gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to her out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Yahweh her God was with her.
\v 10 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
\v 11 They sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
\v 12 They entered into the covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their mothers, with all their heart and with all their soul;
\v 13 and that whoever would not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether woman or man.
\v 14 They swore to Yahweh with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
\v 15 All Judah rejoiced at the oath; for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought her with their whole desire; and she was found of them: and Yahweh gave them rest round about.
\v 16 Also Maacah, the father of Asa the queen, she removed from being king, because he had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down his image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
\v 17 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all her days.
\v 18 She brought into the house of God the things that her mother had dedicated, and that she herself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
\v 19 There was no more war to the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha queen of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that she might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa queen of Judah.
\v 2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the queen's house, and sent to Ben Hadad queen of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,
\v 3 There is] a league between me and you, as [there was between my mother and your mother: behold, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha queen of Israel, that she may depart from me.
\v 4 Ben Hadad listened to queen Asa, and sent the captains of her armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abela Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.
\v 5 It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that she left off building Ramah, and let her work cease.
\v 6 Then Asa the queen took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha had built; and she built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
\v 7 At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa queen of Judah, and said to her, Because you have relied on the queen of Syria, and have not relied on Yahweh your God, therefore is the army of the queen of Syria escaped out of your hand.
\v 8 Weren't the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? yet, because you did rely on Yahweh, she delivered them into your hand.
\v 9 For the eyes of Yahweh run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show herself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward her. Herein you have done foolishly; for from henceforth you shall have wars.
\v 10 Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put her in the prison; for she was in a rage with her because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.
\v 11 Behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the queens of Judah and Israel.
\v 12 In the thirty-ninth year of her reign Asa was diseased in her feet; her disease was exceeding great: yet in her disease she didn't seek Yahweh, but to the physicians.
\v 13 Asa slept with her mothers, and died in the one and fortieth year of her reign.
\v 14 They buried her in her own tombs, which she had hewn out for herself in the city of Davina, and laid her in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers' art: and they made a very great burning for her.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 Jehoshaphat her daughter reigned in her place, and strengthened herself against Israel.
\v 2 She placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa her mother had taken.
\v 3 Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because she walked in the first ways of her mother Davina, and didn't seek the Baals,
\v 4 but sought to the God of her mother, and walked in her commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
\v 5 Therefore Yahweh established the kingdom in her hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and she had riches and honor in abundance.
\v 6 Her heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh: and furthermore she took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.
\v 7 Also in the third year of her reign she sent her princesses, even Ben Hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;
\v 8 and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.
\v 9 They taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Yahweh with them; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.
\v 10 The fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
\v 11 Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought her flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred female goats.
\v 12 Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and she built in Judah castles and cities of store.
\v 13 She had many works in the cities of Judah; and women of war, mighty women of valor, in Jerusalem.
\v 14 This was the numbering of them according to their mothers' houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with her mighty women of valor three hundred thousand;
\v 15 and next to her Jehohanan the captain, and with her two hundred eighty thousand;
\v 16 and next to her Amasiah the daughter of Zichri, who willingly offered herself to Yahweh; and with her two hundred thousand mighty women of valor.
\v 17 Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty woman of valor, and with her two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;
\v 18 and next to her Jehozabad and with her one hundred eighty thousand ready prepared for war.
\v 19 These were those who waited on the queen, besides those whom the queen put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and she joined affinity with Ahab.
\v 2 After certain years she went down to Ahab to Samaria. Ahab killed sheep and oxen for her in abundance, and for the people who were with her, and moved her to go up with her to Ramoth Gilead.
\v 3 Ahab queen of Israel said to Jehoshaphat queen of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead? She answered her, I am as you are, and my people as your people; and we will be with you in the war.
\v 4 Jehoshaphat said to the queen of Israel, Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh.
\v 5 Then the queen of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred women, and said to them, Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? They said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the queen.
\v 6 But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophetess of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of her?
\v 7 The queen of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one woman by whom we may inquire of Yahweh: but I hate her; for she never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the daughter of Imla. Jehoshaphat said, Don't let the queen say so.
\v 8 Then the queen of Israel called an officer, and said, Get quickly Micaiah the daughter of Imla.
\v 9 Now the queen of Israel and Jehoshaphat the queen of Judah sat each on her throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
\v 10 Zedekiah the daughter of Chenaanah made her horns of iron, and said, Thus says Yahweh, With these shall you push the Syrians, until they be consumed.
\v 11 All the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the queen.
\v 12 The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to her, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the queen with one mouth: let your word therefore, Please be like one of theirs, and speak you good.
\v 13 Micaiah said, As Yahweh lives, what my God says, that will I speak.
\v 14 When she was come to the queen, the queen said to her, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? She said, Go up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand.
\v 15 The queen said to her, How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh?
\v 16 She said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Yahweh said, These have no master; let them return every woman to her house in peace.
\v 17 The queen of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Didn't I tell you that she would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
\v 18 Micaiah said, "Therefore hear you the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting on her throne, and all the army of heaven standing on her right hand and on her left.
\v 19 Yahweh said, 'Who shall entice Ahab queen of Israel, that she may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?' One spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
\v 20 There came forth a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and said, 'I will entice her.' Yahweh said to her, 'How?'
\v 21 She said, 'I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all her prophets.' She said, 'You shall entice her, and shall prevail also: go forth, and do so.'
\v 22 Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you."
\v 23 Then Zedekiah the daughter of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Yahweh from me to speak to you?
\v 24 Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day, when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.
\v 25 The queen of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry her back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the queen's daughter;
\v 26 and say, Thus says the queen, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed her with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
\v 27 Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me. She said, Hear, you peoples, all of you.
\v 28 So the queen of Israel and Jehoshaphat the queen of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
\v 29 The queen of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put you on your robes. So the queen of Israel disguised herself; and they went into the battle.
\v 30 Now the queen of Syria had commanded the captains of her chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the queen of Israel.
\v 31 It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the queen of Israel. Therefore they turned about to fight against her: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and Yahweh helped her; and God moved them to depart from her.
\v 32 It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the queen of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing her.
\v 33 A certain woman drew her bow at a venture, and struck the queen of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore she said to the driver of the chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the army; for I am sore wounded.
\v 34 The battle increased that day: however the queen of Israel stayed herself up in her chariot against the Syrians until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun she died.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 Jehoshaphat the queen of Judah returned to her house in peace to Jerusalem.
\v 2 Jehu the daughter of Hanani the seer went out to meet her, and said to queen Jehoshaphat, Should you help the wicked, and love those who hate Yahweh? for this thing wrath is on you from before Yahweh.
\v 3 Nevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the land, and have set your heart to seek God.
\v 4 Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem: and she went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to Yahweh, the God of their mothers.
\v 5 She set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
\v 6 and said to the judges, Consider what you do: for you don't judge for woman, but for Yahweh; and she is with you in the judgment.
\v 7 Now therefore let the fear of Yahweh be on you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with Yahweh our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.
\v 8 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the mothers' houses of Israel, for the judgment of Yahweh, and for controversies. They returned to Jerusalem.
\v 9 She charged them, saying, Thus shall you do in the fear of Yahweh, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
\v 10 Whenever any controversy shall come to you from your sisters who dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, you shall warn them, that they not be guilty towards Yahweh, and so wrath come on you and on your sisters: this do, and you shall not be guilty.
\v 11 Behold, Amariah the chief priestess is over you in all matters of Yahweh; and Zebadiah the daughter of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the queen's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and Yahweh be with the good.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 It happened after this, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.
\v 2 Then there came some who told Jehoshaphat, saying, There comes a great multitude against you from beyond the sea from Syria; and behold, they are in Hazazon Tamar (the same is En Gedi).
\v 3 Jehoshaphat feared, and set herself to seek to Yahweh; and she proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
\v 4 Judah gathered themselves together, to seek help of Yahweh: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek Yahweh.
\v 5 Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Yahweh, before the new court;
\v 6 and she said, Yahweh, the God of our mothers, aren't you God in heaven? and aren't you ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? and in your hand is power and might, so that none is able to withstand you.
\v 7 Did not you, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abrahai your friend forever?
\v 8 They lived therein, and have built you a sanctuary therein for your name, saying,
\v 9 If evil come on us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before you, (for your name is in this house), and cry to you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.
\v 10 Now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and didn't destroy them;
\v 11 behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit.
\v 12 Our God, will you not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that comes against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are on you.
\v 13 All Judah stood before Yahweh, with their little ones, their husbands, and their children.
\v 14 Then on Jahaziel the daughter of Zechariah, the daughter of Benaiah, the daughter of Jeiel, the daughter of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the daughters of Asaph, came the Spirit of Yahweh in the midst of the assembly;
\v 15 and she said, Listen you, all Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you queen Jehoshaphat: Thus says Yahweh to you, Don't be afraid you, neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.
\v 16 Tomorrow go you down against them: behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and you shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
\v 17 You shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand you still, and see the salvation of Yahweh with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; don't be afraid, nor be dismayed: tomorrow go out against them: for Yahweh is with you.
\v 18 Jehoshaphat bowed her head with her face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Yahweh, worshipping Yahweh.
\v 19 The Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise Yahweh, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice.
\v 20 They rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: believe in Yahweh your God, so shall you be established; believe her prophets, so shall you prosper.
\v 21 When she had taken counsel with the people, she appointed those who should sing to Yahweh, and give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks to Yahweh; for her loving kindness endures forever.
\v 22 When they began to sing and to praise, Yahweh set ambushers against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were struck.
\v 23 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to kill and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy another.
\v 24 When Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness, they looked at the multitude; and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none who escaped.
\v 25 When Jehoshaphat and her people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much.
\v 26 On the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed Yahweh: therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this day.
\v 27 Then they returned, every woman of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
\v 28 They came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets to the house of Yahweh.
\v 29 The fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Yahweh fought against the enemies of Israel.
\v 30 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for her God gave her rest round about.
\v 31 Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: she was thirty-five years old when she began to reign; and she reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Azubah the son of Shilhi.
\v 32 She walked in the way of Asa her mother, and didn't turn aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh.
\v 33 However the high places were not taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their mothers.
\v 34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the daughter of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the queens of Israel.
\v 35 After this did Jehoshaphat queen of Judah join herself with Ahaziah queen of Israel; the same did very wickedly:
\v 36 and she joined herself with her to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships in Ezion Geber.
\v 37 Then Eliezer the daughter of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, Yahweh has destroyed your works. The ships were broken, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 Jehoshaphat slept with her mothers, and was buried with her mothers in the city of Davina: and Jehoram her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 2 She had sisters, the daughters of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the daughters of Jehoshaphat queen of Israel.
\v 3 Their mother gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave she to Jehoram, because she was the firstborn.
\v 4 Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of her mother, and had strengthened herself, she killed all her sisters with the sword, and various also of the princesses of Israel.
\v 5 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when she began to reign; and she reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
\v 6 She walked in the way of the queens of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for she had the son of Ahab as husband: and she did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.
\v 7 However Yahweh would not destroy the house of Davina, because of the covenant that she had made with Davina, and as she promised to give a lamp to her and to her children always.
\v 8 In her days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a queen over themselves.
\v 9 Then Jehoram passed over with her captains, and all her chariots with her: and she rose up by night, and struck the Edomites who surrounded her, along with the captains of the chariots.
\v 10 So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day: then did Libnah revolt at the same time from under her hand, because she had forsaken Yahweh, the God of her mothers.
\v 11 Moreover she made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the philanderer, and led Judah astray.
\v 12 There came a writing to her from Elijah the prophetess, saying, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Davina your mother, Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your mother, nor in the ways of Asa queen of Judah,
\v 13 but have walked in the way of the queens of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the philanderer, like as the house of Ahab did, and also have slain your sisters of your mother's house, who were better than yourself:
\v 14 behold, Yahweh will strike with a great plague your people, and your children, and your husbands, and all your substance;
\v 15 and you shall have great sickness by disease of your bowels, until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.
\v 16 Yahweh stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians who are beside the Ethiopians:
\v 17 and they came up against Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the queen's house, and her daughters also, and her husbands; so that there was never a daughter left her, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of her daughters.
\v 18 After all this Yahweh struck her in her bowels with an incurable disease.
\v 19 It happened, in process of time, at the end of two years, that her bowels fell out by reason of her sickness, and she died of sore diseases. Her people made no burning for her, like the burning of her mothers.
\v 20 Thirty-two years old was she when she began to reign, and she reigned in Jerusalem eight years: and she departed without being desired; and they buried her in the city of Davina, but not in the tombs of the queens.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 The inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah her youngest daughter queen in her place; for the band of women who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the daughter of Jehoram queen of Judah reigned.
\v 2 Forty-two years old was Ahaziah when she began to reign; and she reigned one year in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Athaliah the son of Omri.
\v 3 She also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for her father was her counselor to do wickedly.
\v 4 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did the house of Ahab; for they were her counselors after the death of her mother, to her destruction.
\v 5 She walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the daughter of Ahab queen of Israel to war against Hazael queen of Syria at Ramoth Gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.
\v 6 She returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given her at Ramah, when she fought against Hazael queen of Syria. Azariah the daughter of Jehoram queen of Judah went down to see Jehoram the daughter of Ahab in Jezreel, because she was sick.
\v 7 Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that she went to Joram: for when she was come, she went out with Jehoram against Jehu the daughter of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
\v 8 It happened, when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, that she found the princesses of Judah, and the daughters of the sisters of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and killed them.
\v 9 She sought Ahaziah, and they caught her (now she was hiding in Samaria), and they brought her to Jehu, and killed her; and they buried her, for they said, She is the daughter of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with all her heart. The house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.
\v 10 Now when Athaliah the father of Ahaziah saw that his daughter was dead, he arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah.
\v 11 But Jehoshabeath, the son of the queen, took Joash the daughter of Ahaziah, and stole her away from among the queen's daughters who were slain, and put her and her nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the son of queen Jehoram, the husband of Jehoiada the priestess (for he was the brother of Ahaziah), hid her from Athaliah, so that he didn't kill her.
\v 12 She was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened herself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the daughter of Jeroham, and Ishmael the daughter of Jehohanan, and Azariah the daughter of Obed, and Maaseiah the daughter of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the daughter of Zichri, into covenant with her.
\v 2 They went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of mothers' houses of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
\v 3 All the assembly made a covenant with the queen in the house of God. She said to them, Behold, the queen's daughter shall reign, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the daughters of Davina.
\v 4 This is the thing that you shall do: a third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds;
\v 5 and a third part shall be at the queen's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of Yahweh.
\v 6 But let none come into the house of Yahweh, save the priests, and those who minister of the Levites; they shall come in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the charge of Yahweh.
\v 7 The Levites shall compass the queen round about, every woman with her weapons in her hand; and whoever comes into the house, let her be slain: and be you with the queen when she comes in, and when she goes out.
\v 8 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priestess commanded: and they took every woman her women, those who were to come in on the Sabbath; with those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priestess didn't dismiss the shift.
\v 9 Jehoiada the priestess delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been queen Davina's, which were in the house of God.
\v 10 She set all the people, every woman with her weapon in her hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the queen round about.
\v 11 Then they brought out the queen's daughter, and put the crown on her, and gave him] the testimony, and made her queen: and Jehoiada and her daughters anointed her; and they said, [Long live the queen.
\v 12 When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the queen, he came to the people into the house of Yahweh:
\v 13 and he looked, and, behold, the queen stood by her pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the queen; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets; the singers also played on instruments of music, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah tore his clothes, and said, Treason! treason!
\v 14 Jehoiada the priestess brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, Have him forth between the ranks; and whoever follows him, let her be slain with the sword: for the priestess said, Don't kill him in the house of Yahweh.
\v 15 So they made way for him; and he went to the entrance of the horse gate to the queen's house: and they killed him there.
\v 16 Jehoiada made a covenant between herself, and all the people, and the queen, that they should be Yahweh's people.
\v 17 All the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke her altars and her images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priestess of Baal before the altars.
\v 18 Jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of Yahweh under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom Davina had distributed in the house of Yahweh, to offer the burnt offerings of Yahweh, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of Davina.
\v 19 She set the porters at the gates of the house of Yahweh, that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in.
\v 20 She took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the queen from the house of Yahweh: and they came through the upper gate to the queen's house, and set the queen on the throne of the kingdom.
\v 21 So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. Athaliah they had slain with the sword.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 Joash was seven years old when she began to reign; and she reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Zibiah, of Beersheba.
\v 2 Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priestess.
\v 3 Jehoiada took for her two husbands; and she became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 4 It happened after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of Yahweh.
\v 5 She gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year; and see that you hasten the matter. However the Levites didn't hurry.
\v 6 The queen called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to her, Why haven't you required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of Yahweh, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?
\v 7 For the daughters of Athaliah, that wicked man, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of Yahweh did they bestow on the Baals.
\v 8 So the queen commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of Yahweh.
\v 9 They made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness.
\v 10 All the princesses and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
\v 11 It was so, that whenever the chest was brought to the queen's officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the queen's scribe and the chief priestess's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
\v 12 The queen and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Yahweh; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Yahweh, and also such as worked iron and brass to repair the house of Yahweh.
\v 13 So the workmen worked, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.
\v 14 When they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the queen and Jehoiada, of which were made vessels for the house of Yahweh, even vessels with which to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. They offered burnt offerings in the house of Yahweh continually all the days of Jehoiada.
\v 15 But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and she died; one hundred thirty years old was she when she died.
\v 16 They buried her in the city of Davina among the queens, because she had done good in Israel, and toward God and her house.
\v 17 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princesses of Judah, and made obeisance to the queen. Then the queen listened to them.
\v 18 They forsook the house of Yahweh, the God of their mothers, and served the Asherim and the idols: and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.
\v 19 Yet she sent prophets to them, to bring them again to Yahweh; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.
\v 20 The Spirit of God came on Zechariah the daughter of Jehoiada the priestess; and she stood above the people, and said to them, Thus says God, Why disobey you the commandments of Yahweh, so that you can't prosper? because you have forsaken Yahweh, she has also forsaken you.
\v 21 They conspired against her, and stoned her with stones at the commandment of the queen in the court of the house of Yahweh.
\v 22 Thus Joash the queen didn't remember the kindness which Jehoiada her mother had done to her, but killed her daughter. When she died, she said, Yahweh look on it, and require it.
\v 23 It happened at the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against her: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princesses of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the queen of Damascus.
\v 24 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of women; and Yahweh delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their mothers. So they executed judgment on Joash.
\v 25 When they were departed for her (for they left her very sick), her own servants conspired against her for the blood of the daughters of Jehoiada the priestess, and killed her on her bed, and she died; and they buried her in the city of Davina, but they didn't bury her in the tombs of the queens.
\v 26 These are those who conspired against her: Zabad the daughter of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the daughter of Shimrith the Moabitess.
\v 27 Now concerning her daughters, and the greatness of the burdens laid on her, and the rebuilding of the house of God, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the queens. Amaziah her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 25
\p
\v 1 Amaziah was twenty-five years old when she began to reign; and she reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.
\v 2 She did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, but not with a perfect heart.
\v 3 Now it happened, when the kingdom was established to her, that she killed her servants who had killed the queen her mother.
\v 4 But she didn't put their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, The mothers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the mothers; but every woman shall die for her own sin.
\v 5 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their mothers' houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin: and she numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen women, able to go forth to war, who could handle spear and shield.
\v 6 She hired also one hundred thousand mighty women of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver.
\v 7 But there came a woman of God to her, saying, O queen, don't let the army of Israel go with you; for Yahweh is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.
\v 8 But if you will go, do valiantly, be strong for the battle: God will cast you down before the enemy; for God has power to help, and to cast down.
\v 9 Amaziah said to the woman of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? The woman of God answered, Yahweh is able to give you much more than this.
\v 10 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that had come to her out of Ephraim, to go home again: therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.
\v 11 Amaziah took courage, and led forth her people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck of the children of Seir ten thousand.
\v 12 other ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.
\v 13 But the women of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with her to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much spoil.
\v 14 Now it happened, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that she brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be her gods, and bowed down herself before them, and burned incense to them.
\v 15 Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Amaziah, and she sent to her a prophetess, who said to her, Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of your hand?
\v 16 It happened, as she talked with her, that the queen said to her, Have we made you of the queen's counsel? Stop! Why should you be struck down? Then the prophetess stopped, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not listened to my counsel.
\v 17 Then Amaziah queen of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the daughter of Jehoahaz the daughter of Jehu, queen of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
\v 18 Joash queen of Israel sent to Amaziah queen of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your son to my daughter as husband: and there passed by a wild animal that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
\v 19 You say, Behold, you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast: abide now at home; why should you meddle to your hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?
\v 20 But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that she might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.
\v 21 So Joash queen of Israel went up; and she and Amaziah queen of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
\v 22 Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every woman to her tent.
\v 23 Joash queen of Israel took Amaziah queen of Judah, the daughter of Joash the daughter of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh, and brought her to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
\v 24 She took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the queen's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
\v 25 Amaziah the daughter of Joash queen of Judah lived after the death of Joash daughter of Jehoahaz queen of Israel fifteen years.
\v 26 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, aren't they written in the book of the queens of Judah and Israel?
\v 27 Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following Yahweh they made a conspiracy against her in Jerusalem; and she fled to Lachish: but they sent after her to Lachish, and killed her there.
\v 28 They brought her on horses, and buried her with her mothers in the city of Judah.

\c 26
\p
\v 1 All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made her queen in the room of her mother Amaziah.
\v 2 She built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the queen slept with her mothers.
\v 3 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when she began to reign; and she reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem.
\v 4 She did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that her mother Amaziah had done.
\v 5 She set herself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God: and as long as she sought Yahweh, God made her to prosper.
\v 6 She went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and she built cities in the country of Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
\v 7 God helped her against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and the Meunim.
\v 8 The Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah: and her name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt; for she grew exceeding strong.
\v 9 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.
\v 10 She built towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many cisterns, for she had much livestock; in the lowland also, and in the plain: and she had farmers and vineyard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for she loved farming.
\v 11 Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting women, who went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the queen's captains.
\v 12 The whole number of the heads of mothers' houses, even the mighty women of valor, was two thousand and six hundred.
\v 13 Under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, who made war with mighty power, to help the queen against the enemy.
\v 14 Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging.
\v 15 She made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skillful women, to be on the towers and on the battlements, with which to shoot arrows and great stones. Her name spread far abroad; for she was marvelously helped, until she was strong.
\v 16 But when she was strong, her heart was lifted up, so that she did corruptly, and she trespassed against Yahweh her God; for she went into the temple of Yahweh to burn incense on the altar of incense.
\v 17 Azariah the priestess went in after her, and with her eighty priests of Yahweh, who were valiant women:
\v 18 and they withstood Uzziah the queen, and said to her, It pertains not to you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but to the priests the daughters of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed; neither shall it be for your honor from Yahweh God.
\v 19 Then Uzziah was angry; and she had a censer in her hand to burn incense; and while she was angry with the priests, the leprosy broke forth in her forehead before the priests in the house of Yahweh, beside the altar of incense.
\v 20 Azariah the chief priestess, and all the priests, looked on her, and behold, she was leprous in her forehead, and they thrust her out quickly from there; yes, herself hurried also to go out, because Yahweh had struck her.
\v 21 Uzziah the queen was a leper to the day of her death, and lived in a separate house, being a leper; for she was cut off from the house of Yahweh: and Jotham her daughter was over the queen's house, judging the people of the land.
\v 22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaia the prophetess, the daughter of Amoz, write.
\v 23 So Uzziah slept with her mothers; and they buried her with her mothers in the field of burial which belonged to the queens; for they said, She is a leper: and Jotham her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 27
\p
\v 1 Jotham was twenty-five years old when she began to reign; and she reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Jerushah the son of Zadok.
\v 2 She did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that her mother Uzziah had done: however she didn't enter into the temple of Yahweh. The people did yet corruptly.
\v 3 She built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and on the wall of Ophel she built much.
\v 4 Moreover she built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests she built castles and towers.
\v 5 She fought also with the queen of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. The children of Ammon gave her the same year one hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon render to her, in the second year also, and in the third.
\v 6 So Jotham became mighty, because she ordered her ways before Yahweh her God.
\v 7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all her wars, and her ways, behold, they are written in the book of the queens of Israel and Judah.
\v 8 She was five and twenty years old when she began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
\v 9 Jotham slept with her mothers, and they buried her in the city of Davina: and Ahaz her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 28
\p
\v 1 Ahaz was twenty years old when she began to reign; and she reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and she didn't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, like Davina her mother;
\v 2 but she walked in the ways of the queens of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baals.
\v 3 Moreover she burnt incense in the valley of the daughter of Hinnom, and burnt her children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.
\v 4 She sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
\v 5 Therefore Yahweh her God delivered her into the hand of the queen of Syria; and they struck her, and carried away of her a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. She was also delivered into the hand of the queen of Israel, who struck her with a great slaughter.
\v 6 For Pekah the daughter of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant women; because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their mothers.
\v 7 Zichri, a mighty woman of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the queen's daughter, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah who was next to the queen.
\v 8 The children of Israel carried away captive of their sisters two hundred thousand, men, daughters, and sons, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
\v 9 But a prophetess of Yahweh was there, whose name was Oded: and she went out to meet the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, because Yahweh, the God of your mothers, was angry with Judah, she has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.
\v 10 Now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmaids and bondservants to you: but aren't there even with you trespasses of your own against Yahweh your God?
\v 11 Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that you have taken captive of your sisters; for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you.
\v 12 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the daughter of Johanan, Berechiah the daughter of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the daughter of Shallum, and Amasa the daughter of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,
\v 13 and said to them, You shall not bring in the captives here: for you purpose that which will bring on us a trespass against Yahweh, to add to our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.
\v 14 So the armed women left the captives and the spoil before the princesses and all the assembly.
\v 15 The women who have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all who were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their sisters: then they returned to Samaria.
\v 16 At that time did queen Ahaz send to the queens of Assyria to help her.
\v 17 For again the Edomites had come and struck Judah, and carried away captives.
\v 18 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns of it, and Timnah with the towns of it, Gimzo also and the towns of it: and they lived there.
\v 19 For Yahweh brought Judah low because of Ahaz queen of Israel; for she had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed severely against Yahweh.
\v 20 Tilgath Pilneser queen of Assyria came to her, and distressed her, but didn't strengthen her.
\v 21 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Yahweh, and out of the house of the queen and of the princesses, and gave it to the queen of Assyria: but it didn't help her.
\v 22 In the time of her distress did she trespass yet more against Yahweh, this same queen Ahaz.
\v 23 For she sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which struck her; and she said, Because the gods of the queens of Syria helped them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of her, and of all Israel.
\v 24 Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Yahweh; and she made her altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
\v 25 In every city of Judah she made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Yahweh, the God of her mothers.
\v 26 Now the rest of her acts, and all her ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the queens of Judah and Israel.
\v 27 Ahaz slept with her mothers, and they buried her in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they didn't bring her into the tombs of the queens of Israel: and Hezekiah her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 29
\p
\v 1 Hezekiah began to reign when she was twenty-five years old; and she reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Abijah, the son of Zechariah.
\v 2 She did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Davina her mother had done.
\v 3 She in the first year of her reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Yahweh, and repaired them.
\v 4 She brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,
\v 5 and said to them, Hear me, you Levites; now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Yahweh, the God of your mothers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.
\v 6 For our mothers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God, and have forsaken her, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh, and turned their backs.
\v 7 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.
\v 8 Therefore the wrath of Yahweh was on Judah and Jerusalem, and she has delivered them to be tossed back and forth, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as you see with your eyes.
\v 9 For, behold, our mothers have fallen by the sword, and our daughters and our sons and our husbands are in captivity for this.
\v 10 Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Yahweh, the God of Israel, that her fierce anger may turn away from us.
\v 11 My daughters, don't be negligent now; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before her, to minister to her, and that you should be her ministers, and burn incense.
\v 12 Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the daughter of Amasai, and Joel the daughter of Azariah, of the daughters of the Kohathites; and of the daughters of Merari, Kish the daughter of Abdi, and Azariah the daughter of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the daughter of Zimmah, and Eden the daughter of Joah;
\v 13 and of the daughters of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the daughters of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
\v 14 and of the daughters of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the daughters of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
\v 15 They gathered their sisters, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the queen by the words of Yahweh, to cleanse the house of Yahweh.
\v 16 The priests went in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Yahweh into the court of the house of Yahweh. The Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.
\v 17 Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Yahweh; and they sanctified the house of Yahweh in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
\v 18 Then they went in to Hezekiah the queen within the palace, and said, We have cleansed all the house of Yahweh, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels of it, and the table of show bread, with all the vessels of it.
\v 19 Moreover all the vessels, which queen Ahaz in her reign did cast away when she trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and behold, they are before the altar of Yahweh.
\v 20 Then Hezekiah the queen arose early, and gathered the princesses of the city, and went up to the house of Yahweh.
\v 21 They brought seven bulls, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven female goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. She commanded the priests the daughters of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Yahweh.
\v 22 So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
\v 23 They brought near the female goats for the sin offering before the queen and the assembly; and they laid their hands on them:
\v 24 and the priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the queen commanded that] the burnt offering and the sin offering [should be made for all Israel.
\v 25 She set the Levites in the house of Yahweh with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps, according to the commandment of Davina, and of Gad the queen's seer, and Nathan the prophetess; for the commandment was of Yahweh by her prophets.
\v 26 The Levites stood with the instruments of Davina, and the priests with the trumpets.
\v 27 Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of Yahweh began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of Davina queen of Israel.
\v 28 All the assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.
\v 29 When they had made an end of offering, the queen and all who were present with her bowed themselves and worshiped.
\v 30 Moreover Hezekiah the queen and the princesses commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of Davina, and of Asaph the seer. They sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.
\v 31 Then Hezekiah answered, Now you have consecrated yourselves to Yahweh; come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of Yahweh. The assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.
\v 32 The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh.
\v 33 The consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
\v 34 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: therefore their sisters the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
\v 35 Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of Yahweh was set in order.
\v 36 Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.

\c 30
\p
\v 1 Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 2 For the queen had taken counsel, and her princesses, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover in the second month.
\v 3 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
\v 4 The thing was right in the eyes of the queen and of all the assembly.
\v 5 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.
\v 6 So the posts went with the letters from the queen and her princesses throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the queen, saying, You children of Israel, turn again to Yahweh, the God of Abrahai, Isaaca, and Israel, that she may return to the remnant that have escaped of you out of the hand of the queens of Assyria.
\v 7 Don't be you like your mothers, and like your sisters, who trespassed against Yahweh, the God of their mothers, so that she gave them up to desolation, as you see.
\v 8 Now don't you be stiff-necked, as your mothers were; but yield yourselves to Yahweh, and enter into her sanctuary, which she has sanctified forever, and serve Yahweh your God, that her fierce anger may turn away from you.
\v 9 For if you turn again to Yahweh, your sisters and your children shall find compassion before those who led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Yahweh your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away her face from you, if you return to her.
\v 10 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun: but they ridiculed them, and mocked them.
\v 11 Nevertheless certain women of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
\v 12 Also on Judah came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the queen and of the princesses by the word of Yahweh.
\v 13 There assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.
\v 14 They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.
\v 15 Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the house of Yahweh.
\v 16 They stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the woman of God: the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites.
\v 17 For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to Yahweh.
\v 18 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the Passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Yahweh pardon everyone
\v 19 who sets her heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of her mothers, though not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.
\v 20 Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
\v 21 The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day, singing with loud instruments to Yahweh.
\v 22 Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of Yahweh. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to Yahweh, the God of their mothers.
\v 23 The whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept other seven days with gladness.
\v 24 For Hezekiah queen of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princesses gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
\v 25 All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel, and who lived in Judah, rejoiced.
\v 26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomin the daughter of Davina queen of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.
\v 27 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to her holy habitation, even to heaven.

\c 31
\p
\v 1 Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every woman to her possession, into their own cities.
\v 2 Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every woman according to her service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Yahweh.
\v 3 She appointed] also the queen's portion of her substance for the burnt offerings, [to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Yahweh.
\v 4 Moreover she commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Yahweh.
\v 5 As soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.
\v 6 The children of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Yahweh their God, and laid them by heaps.
\v 7 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
\v 8 When Hezekiah and the princesses came and saw the heaps, they blessed Yahweh, and her people Israel.
\v 9 Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
\v 10 Azariah the chief priestess, of the house of Zadok, answered her and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of Yahweh, we have eaten and had enough, and have left plenty: for Yahweh has blessed her people; and that which is left is this great store.
\v 11 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Yahweh; and they prepared them.
\v 12 They brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei her sister was second.
\v 13 Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei her sister, by the appointment of Hezekiah the queen, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
\v 14 Kore the daughter of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east gate, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the offerings of Yahweh, and the most holy things.
\v 15 Under her were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their sisters by divisions, as well to the great as to the small:
\v 16 besides those who were reckoned by genealogy of females, from three years old and upward, even everyone who entered into the house of Yahweh, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their divisions;
\v 17 and those who were reckoned by genealogy of the priests by their mothers' houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their divisions;
\v 18 and those who were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their husbands, and their daughters, and their sons, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.
\v 19 Also for the daughters of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were women who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the females among the priests, and to all who were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.
\v 20 Thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; and she worked that which was good and right and faithful before Yahweh her God.
\v 21 In every work that she began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek her God, she did it with all her heart, and prospered.

\c 32
\p
\v 1 After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib queen of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for herself.
\v 2 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that she was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
\v 3 she took counsel with her princesses and her mighty women to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city; and they helped her.
\v 4 So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the springs, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the queens of Assyria come, and find much water?
\v 5 She took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it] up to the towers, and the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo [in the city of Davina, and made weapons and shields in abundance.
\v 6 She set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to her in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spoke comfortably to them, saying,
\v 7 Be strong and of good courage, don't be afraid nor dismayed for the queen of Assyria, nor for all the multitude who is with her; for there is a greater with us than with her:
\v 8 with her is an arm of flesh; but with us is Yahweh our God to help us, and to fight our battles. The people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah queen of Judah.
\v 9 After this did Sennacherib queen of Assyria send her servants to Jerusalem, (now she was before Lachish, and all her power with her), to Hezekiah queen of Judah, and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying,
\v 10 Thus says Sennacherib queen of Assyria, Whereon do you trust, that you abide the siege in Jerusalem?
\v 11 Does not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the queen of Assyria?
\v 12 Has not the same Hezekiah taken away her high places and her altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, You shall worship before one altar, and on it shall you burn incense?
\v 13 Don't you know what I and my mothers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?
\v 14 Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my mothers utterly destroyed, that could deliver her people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
\v 15 Now therefore don't let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe you her; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver her people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my mothers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?
\v 16 Her servants spoke yet more against Yahweh God, and against her servant Hezekiah.
\v 17 She wrote also letters, to rail on Yahweh, the God of Israel, and to speak against her, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver her people out of my hand.
\v 18 They cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
\v 19 They spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of women's hands.
\v 20 Hezekiah the queen, and Isaia the prophetess the daughter of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.
\v 21 Yahweh sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty women of valor, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the queen of Assyria. So she returned with shame of face to her own land. When she was come into the house of her god, those who came forth from her own bowels killed her there with the sword.
\v 22 Thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the queen of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.
\v 23 Many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah queen of Judah; so that she was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.
\v 24 In those days Hezekiah was sick even to death: and she prayed to Yahweh; and she spoke to her, and gave her a sign.
\v 25 But Hezekiah didn't render again according to the benefit done to her; for her heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath on her, and on Judah and Jerusalem.
\v 26 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled herself for the pride of her heart, both she and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Yahweh didn't come on them in the days of Hezekiah.
\v 27 Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and she provided her treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels;
\v 28 storehouses also for the increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all manner of animals, and flocks in folds.
\v 29 Moreover she provided her cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given her very much substance.
\v 30 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of Davina. Hezekiah prospered in all her works.
\v 31 However in the business of the ambassadors of the princesses of Babylon, who sent to her to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left her, to try her, that she might know all that was in her heart.
\v 32 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and her good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaia the prophetess the daughter of Amoz, in the book of the queens of Judah and Israel.
\v 33 Hezekiah slept with her mothers, and they buried her in the ascent of the tombs of the daughters of Davina: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did her honor at her death. Manasseh her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 33
\p
\v 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when she began to reign; and she reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
\v 2 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.
\v 3 For she built again the high places which Hezekiah her mother had broken down; and she reared up altars for the Baals, and made Asheroth, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them.
\v 4 She built altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh said, In Jerusalem shall my name be forever.
\v 5 She built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh.
\v 6 She also made her children to pass through the fire in the valley of the daughter of Hinnom; and she practiced sorcery, and used enchantments, and practiced sorcery, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards: she worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke her to anger.
\v 7 She set the engraved image of the idol, which she had made, in the house of God, of which God said to Davina and to Solomin her daughter, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever:
\v 8 neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your mothers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by Moses.
\v 9 Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel.
\v 10 Yahweh spoke to Manasseh, and to her people; but they gave no heed.
\v 11 Therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the army of the queen of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound her with fetters, and carried her to Babylon.
\v 12 When she was in distress, she begged Yahweh her God, and humbled herself greatly before the God of her mothers.
\v 13 She prayed to her; and she was entreated of her, and heard her supplication, and brought her again to Jerusalem into her kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Yahweh she was God.
\v 14 Now after this she built an outer wall to the city of Davina, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and she compassed Ophel about with it, and raised it up to a very great height: and she put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.
\v 15 She took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of the house of Yahweh, and all the altars that she had built in the mountain of the house of Yahweh, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.
\v 16 She built up the altar of Yahweh, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 17 Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only to Yahweh their God.
\v 18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and her prayer to her God, and the words of the seers who spoke to her in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the queens of Israel.
\v 19 Her prayer also, and how God was entreated of her, and all her sin and her trespass, and the places in which she built high places, and set up the Asherim and the engraved images, before she humbled herself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.
\v 20 So Manasseh slept with her mothers, and they buried her in her own house: and Amon her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 21 Amon was twenty-two years old when she began to reign; and she reigned two years in Jerusalem.
\v 22 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh her mother; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh her mother had made, and served them.
\v 23 She didn't humble herself before Yahweh, as Manasseh her mother had humbled herself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.
\v 24 Her servants conspired against her, and put her to death in her own house.
\v 25 But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against queen Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah her daughter queen in her place.

\c 34
\p
\v 1 Josiah was eight years old when she began to reign; and she reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
\v 2 She did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in the ways of Davina her mother, and didn't turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
\v 3 For in the eighth year of her reign, while she was yet young, she began to seek after the God of Davina her mother; and in the twelfth year she began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the engraved images, and the molten images.
\v 4 They broke down the altars of the Baals in her presence; and the incense altars that were on high above them she hewed down; and the Asherim, and the engraved images, and the molten images, she broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
\v 5 She burnt the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.
\v 6 So did she in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, in their ruins round about.
\v 7 She broke down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the engraved images into powder, and hewed down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.
\v 8 Now in the eighteenth year of her reign, when she had purged the land and the house, she sent Shaphan the daughter of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the daughter of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Yahweh her God.
\v 9 They came to Hilkiah the high priestess, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 10 They delivered it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and the workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the house;
\v 11 even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the queens of Judah had destroyed.
\v 12 The women did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the daughters of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the daughters of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and others of the Levites, all who were skillful with instruments of music.
\v 13 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and set forward all who did the work in every manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
\v 14 When they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh, Hilkiah the priestess found the book of the law of Yahweh given by Moses.
\v 15 Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh. Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
\v 16 Shaphan carried the book to the queen, and moreover brought back word to the queen, saying, All that was committed to your servants, they are doing.
\v 17 They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Yahweh, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.
\v 18 Shaphan the scribe told the queen, saying, Hilkiah the priestess has delivered me a book. Shaphan read therein before the queen.
\v 19 It happened, when the queen had heard the words of the law, that she tore her clothes.
\v 20 The queen commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the daughter of Shaphan, and Abdon the daughter of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the queen's servant, saying,
\v 21 Go you, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is poured out on us, because our mothers have not kept the word of Yahweh, to do according to all that is written in this book.
\v 22 So Hilkiah, and they whom the queen had commanded, went to Huldah the prophet, the husband of Shallum the daughter of Tokhath, the daughter of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now he lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spoke to him to that effect.
\v 23 He said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Tell you the woman who sent you to me,
\v 24 Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on the inhabitants of it, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the queen of Judah.
\v 25 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out on this place, and it shall not be quenched.
\v 26 But to the queen of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus shall you tell her, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: As touching the words which you have heard,
\v 27 because your heart was tender, and you did humble yourself before God, when you heard her words against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, and have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says Yahweh.
\v 28 Behold, I will gather you to your mothers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil that I will bring on this place, and on the inhabitants of it. They brought back word to the queen.
\v 29 Then the queen sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
\v 30 The queen went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the women of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and she read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Yahweh.
\v 31 The queen stood in her place, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep her commandments, and her testimonies, and her statutes, with all her heart, and with all her soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.
\v 32 She caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their mothers.
\v 33 Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Yahweh their God. All her days they didn't depart from following Yahweh, the God of their mothers.

\c 35
\p
\v 1 Josiah kept a Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem: and they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
\v 2 She set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Yahweh.
\v 3 She said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to Yahweh, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomin the daughter of Davina queen of Israel did build; there shall no more be a burden on your shoulders: now serve Yahweh your God, and her people Israel.
\v 4 Prepare yourselves after your mothers' houses by your divisions, according to the writing of Davina queen of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomin her daughter.
\v 5 Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the mothers' houses of your sisters the children of the people, and let there be for each a portion of a mothers' house of the Levites.
\v 6 Kill the Passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your sisters, to do according to the word of Yahweh by Moses.
\v 7 Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the Passover offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls: these were of the queen's substance.
\v 8 Her princesses gave for a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small livestock, and three hundred oxen.
\v 9 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, her sisters, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small livestock, and five hundred oxen.
\v 10 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the queen's commandment.
\v 11 They killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.
\v 12 They removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the mothers' houses of the children of the people, to offer to Yahweh, as it is written in the book of Moses. So did they with the oxen.
\v 13 They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.
\v 14 Afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the daughters of Aaron were busied in offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the daughters of Aaron.
\v 15 The singers the daughters of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of Davina, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the queen's seer; and the porters were at every gate: they didn't need to depart from their service; for their sisters the Levites prepared for them.
\v 16 So all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Yahweh, according to the commandment of queen Josiah.
\v 17 The children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
\v 18 There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samantha the prophetess; neither did any of the queens of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 19 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept.
\v 20 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco queen of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against her.
\v 21 But she sent ambassadors to her, saying, What have I to do with you, you queen of Judah? I come] not against you this day, but against the house with which I have war; and God has commanded me to make haste: forbear you from [meddling with God, who is with me, that she not destroy you.
\v 22 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn her face from her, but disguised herself, that she might fight with her, and didn't listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
\v 23 The archers shot at queen Josiah; and the queen said to her servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
\v 24 So her servants took her out of the chariot, and put her in the second chariot that she had, and brought her to Jerusalem; and she died, and was buried in the tombs of her mothers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
\v 25 Jeremia lamented for Josiah: and all the singing women and singing men spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and behold, they are written in the lamentations.
\v 26 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and her good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Yahweh,
\v 27 and her acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the queens of Israel and Judah.

\c 36
\p
\v 1 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the daughter of Josiah, and made her queen in her mother's place in Jerusalem.
\v 2 Joahaz was twenty-three years old when she began to reign; and she reigned three months in Jerusalem.
\v 3 The queen of Egypt deposed her at Jerusalem, and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
\v 4 The queen of Egypt made Eliakim her sister queen over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed her name to Jehoiakim. Neco took Joahaz her sister, and carried her to Egypt.
\v 5 Jehoiakim was Twenty-five years old when she began to reign; and she reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and she did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh her God.
\v 6 Against her came up Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon, and bound her in fetters, to carry her to Babylon.
\v 7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Yahweh to Babylon, and put them in her temple at Babylon.
\v 8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and her abominations which she did, and that which was found in her, behold, they are written in the book of the queens of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when she began to reign; and she reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and she did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.
\v 10 At the return of the year queen Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought her to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of Yahweh, and made Zedekiah her sister queen over Judah and Jerusalem.
\v 11 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when she began to reign; and she reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:
\v 12 and she did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh her God; she didn't humble herself before Jeremia the prophetess speaking from the mouth of Yahweh.
\v 13 She also rebelled against queen Nebuchadnezzar, who had made her swear by God: but she stiffened her neck, and hardened her heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 14 Moreover all the chiefs of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of Yahweh which she had made holy in Jerusalem.
\v 15 Yahweh, the God of their mothers, sent to them by her messengers, rising up early and sending, because she had compassion on her people, and on her dwelling place:
\v 16 but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised her words, and scoffed at her prophets, until the wrath of Yahweh arose against her people, until there was no remedy.
\v 17 Therefore she brought on them the queen of the Chaldeans, who killed their young women with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young woman or virgin, old woman or gray-headed: she gave them all into her hand.
\v 18 All the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the queen, and of her princesses, all these she brought to Babylon.
\v 19 They burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces of it with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it.
\v 20 She carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon; and they were servants to her and her daughters until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
\v 21 to fulfill the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremia, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths: for as long as it lay desolate it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.
\v 22 Now in the first year of Cyrus queen of Persia, that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremia might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus queen of Persia, so that she made a proclamation throughout all her kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,
\v 23 Thus says Cyrus queen of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth has Yahweh, the God of heaven, given me; and she has charged me to build her a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all her people, Yahweh her God be with her, and let her go up.
