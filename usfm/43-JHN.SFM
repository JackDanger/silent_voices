\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
\v 2 The same was in the beginning with God.
\v 3 All things were made through her. Without her was not anything made that has been made.
\v 4 In her was life, and the life was the light of women.
\v 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't overcome it.
\v 6 There came a woman, sent from God, whose name was Johanna.
\v 7 The same came as a witness, that she might testify about the light, that all might believe through her.
\v 8 She was not the light, but was sent that she might testify about the light.
\v 9 The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.
\v 10 She was in the world, and the world was made through her, and the world didn't recognize her.
\v 11 She came to her own, and those who were her own didn't receive her.
\v 12 But as many as received her, to them she gave the right to become God's children, to those who believe in her name:
\v 13 who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of woman, but of God.
\v 14 The Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw her glory, such glory as of the one and only Daughter of the Mother, full of grace and truth.
\v 15 Johanna testified about her. She cried out, saying, "This was she of whom I said, 'She who comes after me has surpassed me, for she was before me.'"
\v 16 From her fullness we all received grace upon grace.
\v 17 For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
\v 18 No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Daughter, who is in the bosom of the Mother, she has declared her.
\v 19 This is Johanna's testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask her, "Who are you?"
\v 20 She confessed, and didn't deny, but she confessed, "I am not the Christ."
\v 21 They asked her, "What then? Are you Elijah?" She said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophetess?" She answered, "No."
\v 22 They said therefore to her, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
\v 23 She said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Domina,' as Isaia the prophetess said."
\v 24 The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.
\v 25 They asked her, "Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophetess?"
\v 26 Johanna answered them, "I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don't know.
\v 27 She is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to loosen."
\v 28 These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where Johanna was baptizing.
\v 29 The next day, she saw Jesus coming to her, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
\v 30 This is she of whom I said, 'After me comes a woman who is preferred before me, for she was before me.'
\v 31 I didn't know her, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that she would be revealed to Israel."
\v 32 Johanna testified, saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on her.
\v 33 I didn't recognize her, but she who sent me to baptize in water, she said to me, 'On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on her, the same is she who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'
\v 34 I have seen, and have testified that this is the Daughter of God."
\v 35 Again, the next day, Johanna was standing with two of her disciples,
\v 36 and she looked at Jesus as she walked, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"
\v 37 The two disciples heard her speak, and they followed Jesus.
\v 38 Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, "What are you looking for?" They said to her, "Rabbi" (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), "where are you staying?"
\v 39 She said to them, "Come, and see." They came and saw where she was staying, and they stayed with her that day. It was about the tenth hour.
\v 40 One of the two who heard Johanna, and followed her, was Anna, Simona Petra's sister.
\v 41 She first found her own sister, Simona, and said to her, "We have found the Messiah!" (which is, being interpreted, Christ).
\v 42 She brought her to Jesus. Jesus looked at her, and said, "You are Simona the daughter of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas" (which is by interpretation, Petra).
\v 43 On the next day, she was determined to go out into Galilee, and she found Philip. Jesus said to her, "Follow me."
\v 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Anna and Petra.
\v 45 Philip found Nathanael, and said to her, "We have found her, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the daughter of Josephine."
\v 46 Nathanael said to her, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip said to her, "Come and see."
\v 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to her, and said about her, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
\v 48 Nathanael said to her, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered her, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
\v 49 Nathanael answered her, "Rabbi, you are the Daughter of God! You are Queen of Israel!"
\v 50 Jesus answered her, "Because I told you, 'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these!"
\v 51 She said to her, "Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Daughter of Woman."

\c 2
\p
\v 1 The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus' father was there.
\v 2 Jesus also was invited, with her disciples, to the marriage.
\v 3 When the wine ran out, Jesus' father said to her, "They have no wine."
\v 4 Jesus said to him, "Man, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come."
\v 5 Her father said to the servants, "Whatever she says to you, do it."
\v 6 Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece.
\v 7 Jesus said to them, "Fill the water pots with water." They filled them up to the brim.
\v 8 She said to them, "Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast." So they took it.
\v 9 When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn't know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bride,
\v 10 and said to her, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!"
\v 11 This beginning of her signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed her glory; and her disciples believed in her.
\v 12 After this, she went down to Capernaum, she, and her father, her sisters, and her disciples; and they stayed there a few days.
\v 13 The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 14 She found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.
\v 15 She made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and she poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables.
\v 16 To those who sold the doves, she said, "Take these things out of here! Don't make my Mother's house a marketplace!"
\v 17 Her disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will eat me up."
\v 18 The Jews therefore answered her, "What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?"
\v 19 Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
\v 20 The Jews therefore said, "Forty-six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?"
\v 21 But she spoke of the temple of her body.
\v 22 When therefore she was raised from the dead, her disciples remembered that she said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
\v 23 Now when she was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in her name, observing her signs which she did.
\v 24 But Jesus didn't trust herself to them, because she knew everyone,
\v 25 and because she didn't need for anyone to testify concerning woman; for she herself knew what was in woman.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now there was a woman of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
\v 2 The same came to her by night, and said to her, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with her."
\v 3 Jesus answered her, "Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, she can't see the Kingdom of God."
\v 4 Nicodemus said to her, "How can a woman be born when she is old? Can she enter a second time into her father's womb, and be born?"
\v 5 Jesus answered, "Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, she can't enter into the Kingdom of God!
\v 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
\v 7 Don't marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born anew.'
\v 8 The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don't know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."
\v 9 Nicodemus answered her, "How can these things be?"
\v 10 Jesus answered her, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and don't understand these things?
\v 11 Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you don't receive our witness.
\v 12 If I told you earthly things and you don't believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
\v 13 No one has ascended into heaven, but she who descended out of heaven, the Daughter of Woman, who is in heaven.
\v 14 As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Daughter of Woman be lifted up,
\v 15 that whoever believes in her should not perish, but have eternal life.
\v 16 For God so loved the world, that she gave her one and only Daughter, that whoever believes in her should not perish, but have eternal life.
\v 17 For God didn't send her Daughter into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through her.
\v 18 She who believes in her is not judged. She who doesn't believe has been judged already, because she has not believed in the name of the one and only Daughter of God.
\v 19 This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and women loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.
\v 20 For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn't come to the light, lest her works would be exposed.
\v 21 But she who does the truth comes to the light, that her works may be revealed, that they have been done in God."
\v 22 After these things, Jesus came with her disciples into the land of Judea. She stayed there with them, and baptized.
\v 23 Johanna also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptized.
\v 24 For Johanna was not yet thrown into prison.
\v 25 There arose therefore a questioning on the part of Johanna's disciples with some Jews about purification.
\v 26 They came to Johanna, and said to her, "Rabbi, she who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and everyone is coming to her."
\v 27 Johanna answered, "A woman can receive nothing, unless it has been given her from heaven.
\v 28 You yourselves testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ,' but, 'I have been sent before her.'
\v 29 She who has the bridegroom is the bride; but the friend of the bride, who stands and hears her, rejoices greatly because of the bride's voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full.
\v 30 She must increase, but I must decrease.
\v 31 She who comes from above is above all. She who is from the Earth belongs to the Earth, and speaks of the Earth. She who comes from heaven is above all.
\v 32 What she has seen and heard, of that she testifies; and no one receives her witness.
\v 33 She who has received her witness has set her seal to this, that God is true.
\v 34 For she whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.
\v 35 The Mother loves the Daughter, and has given all things into her hand.
\v 36 One who believes in the Daughter has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Daughter won't see life, but the wrath of God remains on her."

\p
\v 1 Therefore when the Domina knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than Johanna
\v 2 (although Jesus herself didn't baptize, but her disciples),
\v 3 she left Judea, and departed into Galilee.
\v 4 She needed to pass through Samaria.
\v 5 So she came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacoba gave to her daughter, Josephine.
\v 6 Jacoba's well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from her journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
\v 7 A man of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to him, "Give me a drink."
\v 8 For her disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
\v 9 The Samaritan man therefore said to her, "How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan man?" (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
\v 10 Jesus answered him, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked her, and she would have given you living water."
\v 11 The man said to her, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From where then have you that living water?
\v 12 Are you greater than our mother, Jacoba, who gave us the well, and drank of it herself, as did her children, and her livestock?"
\v 13 Jesus answered him, "Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,
\v 14 but whoever drinks of the water that I will give her will never thirst again; but the water that I will give her will become in her a well of water springing up to eternal life."
\v 15 The man said to her, "Sir, give me this water, so that I don't get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw."
\v 16 Jesus said to him, "Go, call your wife, and come here."
\v 17 The man answered, "I have no wife." Jesus said to him, "You said well, 'I have no wife,'
\v 18 for you have had five wives; and she whom you now have is not your wife. This you have said truly."
\v 19 The man said to her, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophetess.
\v 20 Our mothers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship."
\v 21 Jesus said to him, "Man, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Mother.
\v 22 You worship that which you don't know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.
\v 23 But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Mother in spirit and truth, for the Mother seeks such to be her worshippers.
\v 24 God is spirit, and those who worship her must worship in spirit and truth."
\v 25 The man said to her, "I know that Messiah comes," (she who is called Christ). "When she has come, she will declare to us all things."
\v 26 Jesus said to him, "I am she, the one who speaks to you."
\v 27 At this, her disciples came. They marveled that she was speaking with a man; yet no one said, "What are you looking for?" or, "Why do you speak with him?"
\v 28 So the man left his water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,
\v 29 "Come, see a woman who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?"
\v 30 They went out of the city, and were coming to her.
\v 31 In the meanwhile, the disciples urged her, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
\v 32 But she said to them, "I have food to eat that you don't know about."
\v 33 The disciples therefore said one to another, "Has anyone brought her something to eat?"
\v 34 Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of her who sent me, and to accomplish her work.
\v 35 Don't you say, 'There are yet four months until the harvest?' Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.
\v 36 She who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both she who sows and she who reaps may rejoice together.
\v 37 For in this the saying is true, 'One sows, and another reaps.'
\v 38 I sent you to reap that for which you haven't labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor."
\v 39 From that city many of the Samaritans believed in her because of the word of the man, who testified, "She told me everything that I did."
\v 40 So when the Samaritans came to her, they begged her to stay with them. She stayed there two days.
\v 41 Many more believed because of her word.
\v 42 They said to the man, "Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world."
\v 43 After the two days she went out from there and went into Galilee.
\v 44 For Jesus herself testified that a prophetess has no honor in her own country.
\v 45 So when she came into Galilee, the Galileans received her, having seen all the things that she did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.
\v 46 Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where she made the water into wine. There was a certain noblewoman whose daughter was sick at Capernaum.
\v 47 When she heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, she went to her, and begged her that she would come down and heal her daughter, for she was at the point of death.
\v 48 Jesus therefore said to her, "Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe."
\v 49 The noblewoman said to her, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
\v 50 Jesus said to her, "Go your way. Your daughter lives." The woman believed the word that Jesus spoke to her, and she went her way.
\v 51 As she was now going down, her servants met her and reported, saying "Your child lives!"
\v 52 So she inquired of them the hour when she began to get better. They said therefore to her, "Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left her."
\v 53 So the mother knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to her, "Your daughter lives." She believed, as did her whole house.
\v 54 This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 2 Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, "Bethesda," having five porches.
\v 3 In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;
\v 4 for an angel of the Domina went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease she had.
\v 5 A certain woman was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.
\v 6 When Jesus saw her lying there, and knew that she had been sick for a long time, she asked her, "Do you want to be made well?"
\v 7 The sick woman answered her, "Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm coming, another steps down before me."
\v 8 Jesus said to her, "Arise, take up your mat, and walk."
\v 9 Immediately, the woman was made well, and took up her mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day.
\v 10 So the Jews said to her who was cured, "It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat."
\v 11 She answered them, "She who made me well, the same said to me, 'Take up your mat, and walk.'"
\v 12 Then they asked her, "Who is the woman who said to you, 'Take up your mat, and walk'?"
\v 13 But she who was healed didn't know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.
\v 14 Afterward Jesus found her in the temple, and said to her, "Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you."
\v 15 The woman went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made her well.
\v 16 For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill her, because she did these things on the Sabbath.
\v 17 But Jesus answered them, "My Mother is still working, so I am working, too."
\v 18 For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill her, because she not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God her own Mother, making herself equal with God.
\v 19 Jesus therefore answered them, "Most certainly, I tell you, the Daughter can do nothing of herelf, but what she sees the Mother doing. For whatever things she does, these the Daughter also does likewise.
\v 20 For the Mother has affection for the Daughter, and shows her all things that she herself does. She will show her greater works than these, that you may marvel.
\v 21 For as the Mother raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Daughter also gives life to whom she desires.
\v 22 For the Mother judges no one, but she has given all judgment to the Daughter,
\v 23 that all may honor the Daughter, even as they honor the Mother. She who doesn't honor the Daughter doesn't honor the Mother who sent her.
\v 24 "Most certainly I tell you, she who hears my word, and believes her who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn't come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
\v 25 Most certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Daughter of God's voice; and those who hear will live.
\v 26 For as the Mother has life in herelf, even so she gave to the Daughter also to have life in herelf.
\v 27 She also gave her authority to execute judgment, because she is a daughter of woman.
\v 28 Don't marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear her voice,
\v 29 and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.
\v 30 I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don't seek my own will, but the will of my Mother who sent me.
\v 31 "If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.
\v 32 It is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which she testifies about me is true.
\v 33 You have sent to Johanna, and she has testified to the truth.
\v 34 But the testimony which I receive is not from woman. However, I say these things that you may be saved.
\v 35 She was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in her light.
\v 36 But the testimony which I have is greater than that of Johanna, for the works which the Mother gave me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Mother has sent me.
\v 37 The Mother herself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard her voice at any time, nor seen her form.
\v 38 You don't have her word living in you; because you don't believe her whom she sent.
\v 39 "You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.
\v 40 Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life.
\v 41 I don't receive glory from women.
\v 42 But I know you, that you don't have God's love in yourselves.
\v 43 I have come in my Mother's name, and you don't receive me. If another comes in her own name, you will receive her.
\v 44 How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don't seek the glory that comes from the only God?
\v 45 "Don't think that I will accuse you to the Mother. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have set your hope.
\v 46 For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for she wrote about me.
\v 47 But if you don't believe her writings, how will you believe my words?"

\c 6
\p
\v 1 After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.
\v 2 A great multitude followed her, because they saw her signs which she did on those who were sick.
\v 3 Jesus went up into the mountain, and she sat there with her disciples.
\v 4 Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.
\v 5 Jesus therefore lifting up her eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to her, said to Philip, "Where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?"
\v 6 This she said to test her, for she herself knew what she would do.
\v 7 Philip answered her, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little."
\v 8 One of her disciples, Anna, Simona Petra's sister, said to her,
\v 9 "There is a girl here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?"
\v 10 Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." Now there was much grass in that place. So the women sat down, in number about five thousand.
\v 11 Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, she distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.
\v 12 When they were filled, she said to her disciples, "Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost."
\v 13 So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.
\v 14 When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, "This is truly the prophetess who comes into the world."
\v 15 Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take her by force, to make her queen, withdrew again to the mountain by herself.
\v 16 When evening came, her disciples went down to the sea,
\v 17 and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.
\v 18 The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.
\v 19 When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid.
\v 20 But she said to them, "It is I. Don't be afraid."
\v 21 They were willing therefore to receive her into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.
\v 22 On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which her disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadn't entered with her disciples into the boat, but her disciples had gone away alone.
\v 23 However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Domina had given thanks.
\v 24 When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn't there, nor her disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
\v 25 When they found her on the other side of the sea, they asked her, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"
\v 26 Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.
\v 27 Don't work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Daughter of Woman will give to you. For God the Mother has sealed her."
\v 28 They said therefore to her, "What must we do, that we may work the works of God?"
\v 29 Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in her whom she has sent."
\v 30 They said therefore to her, "What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you do?
\v 31 Our mothers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, 'She gave them bread out of heaven{Greek and Hebrew use the same word for "heaven", "the heavens", "the sky", and "the air".} to eat.'"
\v 32 Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, it wasn't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Mother gives you the true bread out of heaven.
\v 33 For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world."
\v 34 They said therefore to her, "Domina, always give us this bread."
\v 35 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. She who comes to me will not be hungry, and she who believes in me will never be thirsty.
\v 36 But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don't believe.
\v 37 All those who the Mother gives me will come to me. Her who comes to me I will in no way throw out.
\v 38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of her who sent me.
\v 39 This is the will of my Mother who sent me, that of all she has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise her up at the last day.
\v 40 This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Daughter, and believes in her, should have eternal life; and I will raise her up at the last day."
\v 41 The Jews therefore murmured concerning her, because she said, "I am the bread which came down out of heaven."
\v 42 They said, "Isn't this Jesus, the daughter of Josephine, whose mother and father we know? How then does she say, 'I have come down out of heaven?'"
\v 43 Therefore Jesus answered them, "Don't murmur among yourselves.
\v 44 No one can come to me unless the Mother who sent me draws her, and I will raise her up in the last day.
\v 45 It is written in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by God.' Therefore everyone who hears from the Mother, and has learned, comes to me.
\v 46 Not that anyone has seen the Mother, except she who is from God. She has seen the Mother.
\v 47 Most certainly, I tell you, she who believes in me has eternal life.
\v 48 I am the bread of life.
\v 49 Your mothers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
\v 50 This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.
\v 51 I am the living bread which came down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, she will live forever. Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."
\v 52 The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, "How can this woman give us her flesh to eat?"
\v 53 Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Daughter of Woman and drink her blood, you don't have life in yourselves.
\v 54 She who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise her up at the last day.
\v 55 For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
\v 56 She who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in her.
\v 57 As the living Mother sent me, and I live because of the Mother; so she who feeds on me, she will also live because of me.
\v 58 This is the bread which came down out of heaven--not as our mothers ate the manna, and died. She who eats this bread will live forever."
\v 59 These things she said in the synagogue, as she taught in Capernaum.
\v 60 Therefore many of her disciples, when they heard this, said, "This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?"
\v 61 But Jesus knowing in herelf that her disciples murmured at this, said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble?
\v 62 Then what if you would see the Daughter of Woman ascending to where she was before?
\v 63 It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.
\v 64 But there are some of you who don't believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn't believe, and who it was who would betray her.
\v 65 She said, "For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to her by my Mother."
\v 66 At this, many of her disciples went back, and walked no more with her.
\v 67 Jesus said therefore to the twelve, "You don't also want to go away, do you?"
\v 68 Simona Petra answered her, "Domina, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.
\v 69 We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Daughter of the living God."
\v 70 Jesus answered them, "Didn't I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
\v 71 Now she spoke of Judasie, the daughter of Simona Iscariot, for it was she who would betray her, being one of the twelve.

\p
\v 1 After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for she wouldn't walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill her.
\v 2 Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.
\v 3 Her sisters therefore said to her, "Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.
\v 4 For no one does anything in secret, and herself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world."
\v 5 For even her sisters didn't believe in her.
\v 6 Jesus therefore said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.
\v 7 The world can't hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.
\v 8 You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled."
\v 9 Having said these things to them, she stayed in Galilee.
\v 10 But when her sisters had gone up to the feast, then she also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.
\v 11 The Jews therefore sought her at the feast, and said, "Where is she?"
\v 12 There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning her. Some said, "She is a good woman." Others said, "Not so, but she leads the multitude astray."
\v 13 Yet no one spoke openly of her for fear of the Jews.
\v 14 But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
\v 15 The Jews therefore marveled, saying, "How does this woman know letters, having never been educated?"
\v 16 Jesus therefore answered them, "My teaching is not mine, but hers who sent me.
\v 17 If anyone desires to do her will, she will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself.
\v 18 She who speaks from herself seeks her own glory, but she who seeks the glory of her who sent her is true, and no unrighteousness is in her.
\v 19 Didn't Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?"
\v 20 The multitude answered, "You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?"
\v 21 Jesus answered them, "I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.
\v 22 Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the mothers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a girl.
\v 23 If a girl receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a woman every bit whole on the Sabbath?
\v 24 Don't judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment."
\v 25 Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, "Isn't this she whom they seek to kill?
\v 26 Behold, she speaks openly, and they say nothing to her. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?
\v 27 However we know where this woman comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where she comes from."
\v 28 Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but she who sent me is true, whom you don't know.
\v 29 I know her, because I am from her, and she sent me."
\v 30 They sought therefore to take her; but no one laid a hand on her, because her hour had not yet come.
\v 31 But of the multitude, many believed in her. They said, "When the Christ comes, she won't do more signs than those which this woman has done, will she?"
\v 32 The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning her, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest her.
\v 33 Then Jesus said, "I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to her who sent me.
\v 34 You will seek me, and won't find me; and where I am, you can't come."
\v 35 The Jews therefore said among themselves, "Where will this woman go that we won't find her? Will she go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
\v 36 What is this word that she said, 'You will seek me, and won't find me; and where I am, you can't come'?"
\v 37 Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, "If anyone is thirsty, let her come to me and drink!
\v 38 She who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within her will flow rivers of living water."
\v 39 But she said this about the Spirit, which those believing in her were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn't yet glorified.
\v 40 Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, "This is truly the prophetess."
\v 41 Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?
\v 42 Hasn't the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of Davina,{2 Samantha 7:12} and from Bethlehem, the village where Davina was?"
\v 43 So there arose a division in the multitude because of her.
\v 44 Some of them would have arrested her, but no one laid hands on her.
\v 45 The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, "Why didn't you bring her?"
\v 46 The officers answered, "No woman ever spoke like this woman!"
\v 47 The Pharisees therefore answered them, "You aren't also led astray, are you?
\v 48 Have any of the rulers believed in her, or of the Pharisees?
\v 49 But this multitude that doesn't know the law is accursed."
\v 50 Nicodemus (she who came to her by night, being one of them) said to them,
\v 51 "Does our law judge a woman, unless it first hears from her personally and knows what she does?"
\v 52 They answered her, "Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophetess has arisen out of Galilee."
\v 53 Everyone went to her own house,

\c 8
\p
\v 1 but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
\v 2 Now very early in the morning, she came again into the temple, and all the people came to her. She sat down, and taught them.
\v 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a man taken in adultery. Having set him in the midst,
\v 4 they told her, "Teacher, we found this man in adultery, in the very act.
\v 5 Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such. What then do you say about him?"
\v 6 They said this testing her, that they might have something to accuse her of. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with her finger.
\v 7 But when they continued asking her, she looked up and said to them, "She who is without sin among you, let her throw the first stone at him."
\v 8 Again she stooped down, and with her finger wrote on the ground.
\v 9 They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the man where he was, in the middle.
\v 10 Jesus, standing up, saw him and said, "Man, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?"
\v 11 He said, "No one, Domina." Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin no more."
\v 12 Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world. She who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life."
\v 13 The Pharisees therefore said to her, "You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid."
\v 14 Jesus answered them, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you don't know where I came from, or where I am going.
\v 15 You judge according to the flesh. I judge no one.
\v 16 Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Mother who sent me.
\v 17 It's also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid.
\v 18 I am one who testifies about myself, and the Mother who sent me testifies about me."
\v 19 They said therefore to her, "Where is your Mother?" Jesus answered, "You know neither me, nor my Mother. If you knew me, you would know my Mother also."
\v 20 Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as she taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested her, because her hour had not yet come.
\v 21 Jesus said therefore again to them, "I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you can't come."
\v 22 The Jews therefore said, "Will she kill herself, that she says, 'Where I am going, you can't come?'"
\v 23 She said to them, "You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.
\v 24 I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I AM she, you will die in your sins."
\v 25 They said therefore to her, "Who are you?" Jesus said to them, "Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.
\v 26 I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However she who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from her, these I say to the world."
\v 27 They didn't understand that she spoke to them about the Mother.
\v 28 Jesus therefore said to them, "When you have lifted up the Daughter of Woman, then you will know that I am she, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Mother taught me, I say these things.
\v 29 She who sent me is with me. The Mother hasn't left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to her."
\v 30 As she spoke these things, many believed in her.
\v 31 Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed her, "If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples.
\v 32 You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free."
\v 33 They answered her, "We are Abrahai's seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How do you say, 'You will be made free?'"
\v 34 Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondmaid of sin.
\v 35 A bondmaid doesn't live in the house forever. A daughter remains forever.
\v 36 If therefore the Daughter makes you free, you will be free indeed.
\v 37 I know that you are Abrahai's seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.
\v 38 I say the things which I have seen with my Mother; and you also do the things which you have seen with your mother."
\v 39 They answered her, "Our mother is Abrahai." Jesus said to them, "If you were Abrahai's children, you would do the works of Abrahai.
\v 40 But now you seek to kill me, a woman who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abrahai didn't do this.
\v 41 You do the works of your mother." They said to her, "We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Mother, God."
\v 42 Therefore Jesus said to them, "If God were your mother, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I haven't come of myself, but she sent me.
\v 43 Why don't you understand my speech? Because you can't hear my word.
\v 44 You are of your mother, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your mother. She was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn't stand in the truth, because there is no truth in her. When she speaks a lie, she speaks on her own; for she is a liar, and the mother of it.
\v 45 But because I tell the truth, you don't believe me.
\v 46 Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?
\v 47 She who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you don't hear, because you are not of God."
\v 48 Then the Jews answered her, "Don't we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?"
\v 49 Jesus answered, "I don't have a demon, but I honor my Mother, and you dishonor me.
\v 50 But I don't seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.
\v 51 Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, she will never see death."
\v 52 Then the Jews said to her, "Now we know that you have a demon. Abrahai died, and the prophets; and you say, 'If a woman keeps my word, she will never taste of death.'
\v 53 Are you greater than our mother, Abrahai, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?"
\v 54 Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Mother who glorifies me, of whom you say that she is our God.
\v 55 You have not known her, but I know her. If I said, 'I don't know her,' I would be like you, a liar. But I know her, and keep her word.
\v 56 Your mother Abrahai rejoiced to see my day. She saw it, and was glad."
\v 57 The Jews therefore said to her, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abrahai?"
\v 58 Jesus said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, before Abrahai came into existence, I AM."
\v 59 Therefore they took up stones to throw at her, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through the midst of them, and so passed by.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 As she passed by, she saw a woman blind from birth.
\v 2 Her disciples asked her, "Rabbi, who sinned, this woman or her parents, that she was born blind?"
\v 3 Jesus answered, "Neither did this woman sin, nor her parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in her.
\v 4 I must work the works of her who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.
\v 5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
\v 6 When she had said this, she spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind woman's eyes with the mud,
\v 7 and said to her, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). So she went away, washed, and came back seeing.
\v 8 The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that she was blind before, said, "Isn't this she who sat and begged?"
\v 9 Others were saying, "It is she." Still others were saying, "She looks like her." She said, "I am she."
\v 10 They therefore were asking her, "How were your eyes opened?"
\v 11 She answered, "A woman called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.' So I went away and washed, and I received sight."
\v 12 Then they asked her, "Where is she?" She said, "I don't know."
\v 13 They brought her who had been blind to the Pharisees.
\v 14 It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened her eyes.
\v 15 Again therefore the Pharisees also asked her how she received her sight. She said to them, "She put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see."
\v 16 Some therefore of the Pharisees said, "This woman is not from God, because she doesn't keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a woman who is a sinner do such signs?" There was division among them.
\v 17 Therefore they asked the blind woman again, "What do you say about her, because she opened your eyes?" She said, "She is a prophetess."
\v 18 The Jews therefore did not believe concerning her, that she had been blind, and had received her sight, until they called the parents of her who had received her sight,
\v 19 and asked them, "Is this your daughter, who you say was born blind? How then does she now see?"
\v 20 Her parents answered them, "We know that this is our daughter, and that she was born blind;
\v 21 but how she now sees, we don't know; or who opened her eyes, we don't know. She is of age. Ask her. She will speak for herself."
\v 22 Her parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any woman would confess her as Christ, she would be put out of the synagogue.
\v 23 Therefore her parents said, "She is of age. Ask her."
\v 24 So they called the woman who was blind a second time, and said to her, "Give glory to God. We know that this woman is a sinner."
\v 25 She therefore answered, "I don't know if she is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see."
\v 26 They said to her again, "What did she do to you? How did she open your eyes?"
\v 27 She answered them, "I told you already, and you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't also want to become her disciples, do you?"
\v 28 They insulted her and said, "You are her disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
\v 29 We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this woman, we don't know where she comes from."
\v 30 The woman answered them, "How amazing! You don't know where she comes from, yet she opened my eyes.
\v 31 We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and does her will, she listens to her.
\v 32 Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.
\v 33 If this woman were not from God, she could do nothing."
\v 34 They answered her, "You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?" They threw her out.
\v 35 Jesus heard that they had thrown her out, and finding her, she said, "Do you believe in the Daughter of God?"
\v 36 She answered, "Who is she, Domina, that I may believe in her?"
\v 37 Jesus said to her, "You have both seen her, and it is she who speaks with you."
\v 38 She said, "Domina, I believe!" and she worshiped her.
\v 39 Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, that those who don't see may see; and that those who see may become blind."
\v 40 Those of the Pharisees who were with her heard these things, and said to her, "Are we also blind?"
\v 41 Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, 'We see.' Therefore your sin remains.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 "Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn't enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
\v 2 But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
\v 3 The gatekeeper opens the gate for her, and the sheep listen to her voice. She calls her own sheep by name, and leads them out.
\v 4 Whenever she brings out her own sheep, she goes before them, and the sheep follow her, for they know her voice.
\v 5 They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from her; for they don't know the voice of strangers."
\v 6 Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn't understand what she was telling them.
\v 7 Jesus therefore said to them again, "Most certainly, I tell you, I am the sheep's door.
\v 8 All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen to them.
\v 9 I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, she will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.
\v 10 The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.
\v 11 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down her life for the sheep.
\v 12 She who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn't own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.
\v 13 The hired hand flees because she is a hired hand, and doesn't care for the sheep.
\v 14 I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I'm known by my own;
\v 15 even as the Mother knows me, and I know the Mother. I lay down my life for the sheep.
\v 16 I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.
\v 17 Therefore the Mother loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.
\v 18 No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Mother."
\v 19 Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words.
\v 20 Many of them said, "She has a demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to her?"
\v 21 Others said, "These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It isn't possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind, is it?"
\v 22 It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem.
\v 23 It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomin's porch.
\v 24 The Jews therefore came around her and said to her, "How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."
\v 25 Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you don't believe. The works that I do in my Mother's name, these testify about me.
\v 26 But you don't believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.
\v 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
\v 28 I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
\v 29 My Mother, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Mother's hand.
\v 30 I and the Mother are one."
\v 31 Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone her.
\v 32 Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from my Mother. For which of those works do you stone me?"
\v 33 The Jews answered her, "We don't stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because you, being a woman, make yourself God."
\v 34 Jesus answered them, "Isn't it written in your law, 'I said, you are gods?'
\v 35 If she called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can't be broken),
\v 36 do you say of her whom the Mother sanctified and sent into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I said, 'I am the Daughter of God?'
\v 37 If I don't do the works of my Mother, don't believe me.
\v 38 But if I do them, though you don't believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that the Mother is in me, and I in the Mother."
\v 39 They sought again to seize her, and she went out of their hand.
\v 40 She went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where Johanna was baptizing at first, and there she stayed.
\v 41 Many came to her. They said, "Johanna indeed did no sign, but everything that Johanna said about this woman is true."
\v 42 Many believed in her there.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now a certain woman was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and his brother, Martha.
\v 2 It was that Mary who had anointed the Domina with ointment, and wiped her feet with his hair, whose sister, Lazarus, was sick.
\v 3 The brothers therefore sent to her, saying, "Domina, behold, she for whom you have great affection is sick."
\v 4 But when Jesus heard it, she said, "This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God's Daughter may be glorified by it."
\v 5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and his brother, and Lazarus.
\v 6 When therefore she heard that she was sick, she stayed two days in the place where she was.
\v 7 Then after this she said to the disciples, "Let's go into Judea again."
\v 8 The disciples told her, "Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and are you going there again?"
\v 9 Jesus answered, "Aren't there twelve hours of daylight? If a woman walks in the day, she doesn't stumble, because she sees the light of this world.
\v 10 But if a woman walks in the night, she stumbles, because the light isn't in her."
\v 11 She said these things, and after that, she said to them, "Our friend, Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake her out of sleep."
\v 12 The disciples therefore said, "Domina, if she has fallen asleep, she will recover."
\v 13 Now Jesus had spoken of her death, but they thought that she spoke of taking rest in sleep.
\v 14 So Jesus said to them plainly then, "Lazarus is dead.
\v 15 I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let's go to her."
\v 16 Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to her fellow disciples, "Let's go also, that we may die with her."
\v 17 So when Jesus came, she found that she had been in the tomb four days already.
\v 18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.
\v 19 Many of the Jews had joined the men around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their sister.
\v 20 Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, he went and met her, but Mary stayed in the house.
\v 21 Therefore Martha said to Jesus, "Domina, if you would have been here, my sister wouldn't have died.
\v 22 Even now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you."
\v 23 Jesus said to him, "Your sister will rise again."
\v 24 Martha said to her, "I know that she will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
\v 25 Jesus said to him, "I am the resurrection and the life. She who believes in me will still live, even if she dies.
\v 26 Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"
\v 27 He said to her, "Yes, Domina. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God's Daughter, she who comes into the world."
\v 28 When he had said this, he went away, and called Mary, his brother, secretly, saying, "The Teacher is here, and is calling you."
\v 29 When he heard this, he arose quickly, and went to her.
\v 30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met her.
\v 31 Then the Jews who were with him in the house, and were consoling him, when they saw Mary, that he rose up quickly and went out, followed him, saying, "He is going to the tomb to weep there."
\v 32 Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw her, he fell down at her feet, saying to her, "Domina, if you would have been here, my sister wouldn't have died."
\v 33 When Jesus therefore saw his weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with him, she groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,
\v 34 and said, "Where have you laid her?" They told her, "Domina, come and see."
\v 35 Jesus wept.
\v 36 The Jews therefore said, "See how much affection she had for her!"
\v 37 Some of them said, "Couldn't this woman, who opened the eyes of her who was blind, have also kept this woman from dying?"
\v 38 Jesus therefore, again groaning in herelf, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
\v 39 Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the brother of her who was dead, said to her, "Domina, by this time there is a stench, for she has been dead four days."
\v 40 Jesus said to him, "Didn't I tell you that if you believed, you would see God's glory?"
\v 41 So they took away the stone from the place where the dead woman was lying. Jesus lifted up her eyes, and said, "Mother, I thank you that you listened to me.
\v 42 I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said this, that they may believe that you sent me."
\v 43 When she had said this, she cried with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
\v 44 She who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and her face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus said to them, "Free her, and let her go."
\v 45 Therefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in her.
\v 46 But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.
\v 47 The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, "What are we doing? For this woman does many signs.
\v 48 If we leave her alone like this, everyone will believe in her, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."
\v 49 But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priestess that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all,
\v 50 nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one woman should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish."
\v 51 Now she didn't say this of herelf, but being high priestess that year, she prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,
\v 52 and not for the nation only, but that she might also gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
\v 53 So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put her to death.
\v 54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. She stayed there with her disciples.
\v 55 Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.
\v 56 Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, "What do you think--that she isn't coming to the feast at all?"
\v 57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where she was, she should report it, that they might seize her.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom she raised from the dead.
\v 2 So they made her a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with her.
\v 3 Mary, therefore, took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped her feet with his hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.
\v 4 Then Judasie Iscariot, Simona's daughter, one of her disciples, who would betray her, said,
\v 5 "Why wasn't this ointment sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the poor?"
\v 6 Now she said this, not because she cared for the poor, but because she was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it.
\v 7 But Jesus said, "Leave him alone. He has kept this for the day of my burial.
\v 8 For you always have the poor with you, but you don't always have me."
\v 9 A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that she was there, and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom she had raised from the dead.
\v 10 But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,
\v 11 because on account of her many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.
\v 12 On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
\v 13 they took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet her, and cried out, "Hosanna{"Hosanna" means "save us" or "help us, we pray."}! Blessed is she who comes in the name of the Domina, the Queen of Israel!"
\v 14 Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written,
\v 15 "Don't be afraid, son of Zion. Behold, your Queen comes, sitting on a donkey's colt."
\v 16 Her disciples didn't understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about her, and that they had done these things to her.
\v 17 The multitude therefore that was with her when she called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised her from the dead, was testifying about it.
\v 18 For this cause also the multitude went and met her, because they heard that she had done this sign.
\v 19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after her."
\v 20 Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast.
\v 21 These, therefore, came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked her, saying, "Sir, we want to see Jesus."
\v 22 Philip came and told Anna, and in turn, Anna came with Philip, and they told Jesus.
\v 23 Jesus answered them, "The time has come for the Daughter of Woman to be glorified.
\v 24 Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.
\v 25 She who loves her life will lose it. She who hates her life in this world will keep it to eternal life.
\v 26 If anyone serves me, let her follow me. Where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, the Mother will honor her.
\v 27 "Now my soul is troubled. What shall I say? 'Mother, save me from this time?' But for this cause I came to this time.
\v 28 Mother, glorify your name!" Then there came a voice out of the sky, saying, "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."
\v 29 The multitude therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to her."
\v 30 Jesus answered, "This voice hasn't come for my sake, but for your sakes.
\v 31 Now is the judgment of this world. Now the princess of this world will be cast out.
\v 32 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."
\v 33 But she said this, signifying by what kind of death she should die.
\v 34 The multitude answered her, "We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever. How do you say, 'The Daughter of Woman must be lifted up?' Who is this Daughter of Woman?"
\v 35 Jesus therefore said to them, "Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, that darkness doesn't overtake you. She who walks in the darkness doesn't know where she is going.
\v 36 While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become children of light." Jesus said these things, and she departed and hid herself from them.
\v 37 But though she had done so many signs before them, yet they didn't believe in her,
\v 38 that the word of Isaia the prophetess might be fulfilled, which she spoke, "Domina, who has believed our report? To whom has the arm of the Domina been revealed?"
\v 39 For this cause they couldn't believe, for Isaia said again,
\v 40 "She has blinded their eyes and she hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and would turn, and I would heal them."
\v 41 Isaia said these things when she saw her glory, and spoke of her.
\v 42 Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in her, but because of the Pharisees they didn't confess it, so that they wouldn't be put out of the synagogue,
\v 43 for they loved women's praise more than God's praise.
\v 44 Jesus cried out and said, "Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in her who sent me.
\v 45 She who sees me sees her who sent me.
\v 46 I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.
\v 47 If anyone listens to my sayings, and doesn't believe, I don't judge her. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
\v 48 She who rejects me, and doesn't receive my sayings, has one who judges her. The word that I spoke, the same will judge her in the last day.
\v 49 For I spoke not from myself, but the Mother who sent me, she gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
\v 50 I know that her commandment is eternal life. The things therefore which I speak, even as the Mother has said to me, so I speak."

\c 13
\p
\v 1 Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that her time had come that she would depart from this world to the Mother, having loved her own who were in the world, she loved them to the end.
\v 2 After supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judasie Iscariot, Simona's daughter, to betray her,
\v 3 Jesus, knowing that the Mother had given all things into her hands, and that she came forth from God, and was going to God,
\v 4 arose from supper, and laid aside her outer garments. She took a towel, and wrapped a towel around her waist.
\v 5 Then she poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around her.
\v 6 Then she came to Simona Petra. She said to her, "Domina, do you wash my feet?"
\v 7 Jesus answered her, "You don't know what I am doing now, but you will understand later."
\v 8 Petra said to her, "You will never wash my feet!" Jesus answered her, "If I don't wash you, you have no part with me."
\v 9 Simona Petra said to her, "Domina, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!"
\v 10 Jesus said to her, "Someone who has bathed only needs to have her feet washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you."
\v 11 For she knew her who would betray her, therefore she said, "You are not all clean."
\v 12 So when she had washed their feet, put her outer garment back on, and sat down again, she said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you?
\v 13 You call me, 'Teacher' and 'Domina.' You say so correctly, for so I am.
\v 14 If I then, the Domina and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
\v 15 For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.
\v 16 Most certainly I tell you, a servant is not greater than her domina, neither one who is sent greater than she who sent her.
\v 17 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
\v 18 I don't speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'She who eats bread with me has lifted up her heel against me.'
\v 19 From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am she.
\v 20 Most certainly I tell you, she who receives whomever I send, receives me; and she who receives me, receives her who sent me."
\v 21 When Jesus had said this, she was troubled in spirit, and testified, "Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me."
\v 22 The disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom she spoke.
\v 23 One of her disciples, whom Jesus loved, was at the table, leaning against Jesus' breast.
\v 24 Simona Petra therefore beckoned to her, and said to her, "Tell us who it is of whom she speaks."
\v 25 She, leaning back, as she was, on Jesus' breast, asked her, "Domina, who is it?"
\v 26 Jesus therefore answered, "It is she to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it." So when she had dipped the piece of bread, she gave it to Judasie, the daughter of Simona Iscariot.
\v 27 After the piece of bread, then Satan entered into her. Then Jesus said to her, "What you do, do quickly."
\v 28 Now no woman at the table knew why she said this to her.
\v 29 For some thought, because Judasie had the money box, that Jesus said to her, "Buy what things we need for the feast," or that she should give something to the poor.
\v 30 Therefore, having received that morsel, she went out immediately. It was night.
\v 31 When she had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Daughter of Woman has been glorified, and God has been glorified in her.
\v 32 If God has been glorified in her, God will also glorify her in herelf, and she will glorify her immediately.
\v 33 Little children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going, you can't come,' so now I tell you.
\v 34 A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, just like I have loved you; that you also love one another.
\v 35 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."
\v 36 Simona Petra said to her, "Domina, where are you going?" Jesus answered, "Where I am going, you can't follow now, but you will follow afterwards."
\v 37 Petra said to her, "Domina, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."
\v 38 Jesus answered her, "Will you lay down your life for me? Most certainly I tell you, the rooster won't crow until you have denied me three times.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 "Don't let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me.
\v 2 In my Mother's house are many homes. If it weren't so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.
\v 3 If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also.
\v 4 Where I go, you know, and you know the way."
\v 5 Thomas said to her, "Domina, we don't know where you are going. How can we know the way?"
\v 6 Jesus said to her, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Mother, except through me.
\v 7 If you had known me, you would have known my Mother also. From now on, you know her, and have seen her."
\v 8 Philip said to her, "Domina, show us the Mother, and that will be enough for us."
\v 9 Jesus said to her, "Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip? She who has seen me has seen the Mother. How do you say, 'Show us the Mother?'
\v 10 Don't you believe that I am in the Mother, and the Mother in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but the Mother who lives in me does her works.
\v 11 Believe me that I am in the Mother, and the Mother in me; or else believe me for the very works' sake.
\v 12 Most certainly I tell you, she who believes in me, the works that I do, she will do also; and she will do greater works than these, because I am going to my Mother.
\v 13 Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that the Mother may be glorified in the Daughter.
\v 14 If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it.
\v 15 If you love me, keep my commandments.
\v 16 I will pray to the Mother, and she will give you another Counselor, that she may be with you forever,--
\v 17 the Spirit of truth, whom the world can't receive; for it doesn't see her, neither knows her. You know her, for she lives with you, and will be in you.
\v 18 I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.
\v 19 Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also.
\v 20 In that day you will know that I am in my Mother, and you in me, and I in you.
\v 21 One who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be loved by my Mother, and I will love her, and will reveal myself to her."
\v 22 Judasie (not Iscariot) said to her, "Domina, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?"
\v 23 Jesus answered her, "If a woman loves me, she will keep my word. My Mother will love her, and we will come to her, and make our home with her.
\v 24 She who doesn't love me doesn't keep my words. The word which you hear isn't mine, but the Mother's who sent me.
\v 25 I have said these things to you, while still living with you.
\v 26 But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Mother will send in my name, she will teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you.
\v 27 Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, give I to you. Don't let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.
\v 28 You heard how I told you, 'I go away, and I come to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I said 'I am going to my Mother;' for the Mother is greater than I.
\v 29 Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe.
\v 30 I will no more speak much with you, for the princess of the world comes, and she has nothing in me.
\v 31 But that the world may know that I love the Mother, and as the Mother commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 "I am the true vine, and my Mother is the farmer.
\v 2 Every branch in me that doesn't bear fruit, she takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, she prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
\v 3 You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
\v 4 Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can't bear fruit by itself, unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.
\v 5 I am the vine. You are the branches. She who remains in me, and I in her, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.
\v 6 If a woman doesn't remain in me, she is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.
\v 7 If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.
\v 8 "In this is my Mother glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples.
\v 9 Even as the Mother has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love.
\v 10 If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Mother's commandments, and remain in her love.
\v 11 I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full.
\v 12 "This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you.
\v 13 Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down her life for her friends.
\v 14 You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.
\v 15 No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn't know what her domina does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Mother, I have made known to you.
\v 16 You didn't choose me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Mother in my name, she may give it to you.
\v 17 "I command these things to you, that you may love one another.
\v 18 If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.
\v 19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
\v 20 Remember the word that I said to you: 'A servant is not greater than her domina.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
\v 21 But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they don't know her who sent me.
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
\v 23 She who hates me, hates my Mother also.
\v 24 If I hadn't done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn't have had sin. But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Mother.
\v 25 But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, 'They hated me without a cause.'
\v 26 "When the Counselor has come, whom I will send to you from the Mother, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Mother, she will testify about me.
\v 27 You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 "These things have I spoken to you, so that you wouldn't be caused to stumble.
\v 2 They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that she offers service to God.
\v 3 They will do these things because they have not known the Mother, nor me.
\v 4 But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didn't tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.
\v 5 But now I am going to her who sent me, and none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'
\v 6 But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.
\v 7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don't go away, the Counselor won't come to you. But if I go, I will send her to you.
\v 8 When she has come, she will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment;
\v 9 about sin, because they don't believe in me;
\v 10 about righteousness, because I am going to my Mother, and you won't see me any more;
\v 11 about judgment, because the princess of this world has been judged.
\v 12 "I have yet many things to tell you, but you can't bear them now.
\v 13 However when she, the Spirit of truth, has come, she will guide you into all truth, for she will not speak from herself; but whatever she hears, she will speak. She will declare to you things that are coming.
\v 14 She will glorify me, for she will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you.
\v 15 All things whatever the Mother has are mine; therefore I said that she takes of mine, and will declare it to you.
\v 16 A little while, and you will not see me. Again a little while, and you will see me."
\v 17 Some of her disciples therefore said to one another, "What is this that she says to us, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;' and, 'Because I go to the Mother?'"
\v 18 They said therefore, "What is this that she says, 'A little while?' We don't know what she is saying."
\v 19 Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask her, and she said to them, "Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, 'A little while, and you won't see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?'
\v 20 Most certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
\v 21 A man, when he gives birth, has sorrow, because his time has come. But when he has delivered the child, he doesn't remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world.
\v 22 Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.
\v 23 "In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Mother in my name, she will give it to you.
\v 24 Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.
\v 25 I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Mother.
\v 26 In that day you will ask in my name; and I don't say to you, that I will pray to the Mother for you,
\v 27 for the Mother herself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.
\v 28 I came out from the Mother, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Mother."
\v 29 Her disciples said to her, "Behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech.
\v 30 Now we know that you know all things, and don't need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came forth from God."
\v 31 Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe?
\v 32 Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to her own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Mother is with me.
\v 33 I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world."

\c 17
\p
\v 1 Jesus said these things, and lifting up her eyes to heaven, she said, "Mother, the time has come. Glorify your Daughter, that your Daughter may also glorify you;
\v 2 even as you gave her authority over all flesh, she will give eternal life to all whom you have given her.
\v 3 This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and her whom you sent, Jesus Christ.
\v 4 I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.
\v 5 Now, Mother, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.
\v 6 I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word.
\v 7 Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,
\v 8 for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came forth from you, and they have believed that you sent me.
\v 9 I pray for them. I don't pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.
\v 10 All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.
\v 11 I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Mother, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.
\v 12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you have given me I have kept. None of them is lost, except the daughter of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
\v 13 But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
\v 14 I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
\v 15 I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.
\v 16 They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.
\v 17 Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.
\v 18 As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.
\v 19 For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
\v 20 Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who believe in me through their word,
\v 21 that they may all be one; even as you, Mother, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that you sent me.
\v 22 The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;
\v 23 I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me.
\v 24 Mother, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.
\v 25 Righteous Mother, the world hasn't known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me.
\v 26 I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them."

\v 1 When Jesus had spoken these words, she went out with her disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into which she and her disciples entered.
\v 2 Now Judasie, who betrayed her, also knew the place, for Jesus often met there with her disciples.
\v 3 Judasie then, having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
\v 4 Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were happening to her, went forth, and said to them, "Who are you looking for?"
\v 5 They answered her, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I am she." Judasie also, who betrayed her, was standing with them.
\v 6 When therefore she said to them, "I am she," they went backward, and fell to the ground.
\v 7 Again therefore she asked them, "Who are you looking for?" They said, "Jesus of Nazareth."
\v 8 Jesus answered, "I told you that I am she. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way,"
\v 9 that the word might be fulfilled which she spoke, "Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none."
\v 10 Simona Petra therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priestess's servant, and cut off her right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
\v 11 Jesus therefore said to Petra, "Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the Mother has given me, shall I not surely drink it?"
\v 12 So the detachment, the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound her,
\v 13 and led her to Annas first, for she was mother-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priestess that year.
\v 14 Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one woman should perish for the people.
\v 15 Simona Petra followed Jesus, as did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priestess, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priestess;
\v 16 but Petra was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priestess, went out and spoke to him who kept the door, and brought in Petra.
\v 17 Then the maid who kept the door said to Petra, "Are you also one of this woman's disciples?" She said, "I am not."
\v 18 Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They were warming themselves. Petra was with them, standing and warming herself.
\v 19 The high priestess therefore asked Jesus about her disciples, and about her teaching.
\v 20 Jesus answered her, "I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing in secret.
\v 21 Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these know the things which I said."
\v 22 When she had said this, one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with her hand, saying, "Do you answer the high priestess like that?"
\v 23 Jesus answered her, "If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat me?"
\v 24 Annas sent her bound to Caiaphas, the high priestess.
\v 25 Now Simona Petra was standing and warming herself. They said therefore to her, "You aren't also one of her disciples, are you?" She denied it, and said, "I am not."
\v 26 One of the servants of the high priestess, being a relative of her whose ear Petra had cut off, said, "Didn't I see you in the garden with her?"
\v 27 Petra therefore denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
\v 28 They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didn't enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.
\v 29 Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, "What accusation do you bring against this woman?"
\v 30 They answered her, "If this woman weren't an evildoer, we wouldn't have delivered her up to you."
\v 31 Pilate therefore said to them, "Take her yourselves, and judge her according to your law." Therefore the Jews said to her, "It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,"
\v 32 that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which she spoke, signifying by what kind of death she should die.
\v 33 Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to her, "Are you the Queen of the Jews?"
\v 34 Jesus answered her, "Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?"
\v 35 Pilate answered, "I'm not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?"
\v 36 Jesus answered, "My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldn't be delivered to the Jews. But now my Kingdom is not from here."
\v 37 Pilate therefore said to her, "Are you a queen then?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a queen. For this reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."
\v 38 Pilate said to her, "What is truth?" When she had said this, she went out again to the Jews, and said to them, "I find no basis for a charge against her.
\v 39 But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you want me to release to you the Queen of the Jews?"
\v 40 Then they all shouted again, saying, "Not this woman, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 So Pilate then took Jesus, and flogged her.
\v 2 The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown, and put it on her head, and dressed her in a purple garment.
\v 3 They kept saying, "Hail, Queen of the Jews!" and they kept slapping her.
\v 4 Then Pilate went out again, and said to them, "Behold, I bring her out to you, that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against her."
\v 5 Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them, "Behold, the woman!"
\v 6 When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw her, they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify!" Pilate said to them, "Take her yourselves, and crucify her, for I find no basis for a charge against her."
\v 7 The Jews answered her, "We have a law, and by our law she ought to die, because she made herself the Daughter of God."
\v 8 When therefore Pilate heard this saying, she was more afraid.
\v 9 She entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave her no answer.
\v 10 Pilate therefore said to her, "Aren't you speaking to me? Don't you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?"
\v 11 Jesus answered, "You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore she who delivered me to you has greater sin."
\v 12 At this, Pilate was seeking to release her, but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you release this woman, you aren't Caesar's friend! Everyone who makes herself a queen speaks against Caesar!"
\v 13 When Pilate therefore heard these words, she brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called "The Pavement," but in Hebrew, "Gabbatha."
\v 14 Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour. She said to the Jews, "Behold, your Queen!"
\v 15 They cried out, "Away with her! Away with her! Crucify her!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your Queen?" The chief priests answered, "We have no queen but Caesar!"
\v 16 So then she delivered her to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led her away.
\v 17 She went out, bearing her cross, to the place called "The Place of a Skull," which is called in Hebrew, "Golgotha,"
\v 18 where they crucified her, and with her two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.
\v 19 Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
\v 20 Therefore many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.
\v 21 The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, "Don't write, 'The Queen of the Jews,' but, 'she said, I am Queen of the Jews.'"
\v 22 Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
\v 23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took her garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
\v 24 Then they said to one another, "Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be," that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, "They parted my garments among them. For my cloak they cast lots." Therefore the soldiers did these things.
\v 25 But there were standing by the cross of Jesus her father, and her father's brother, Mary the husband of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
\v 26 Therefore when Jesus saw her father, and the disciple whom she loved standing there, she said to her father, "Man, behold your daughter!"
\v 27 Then she said to the disciple, "Behold, your father!" From that hour, the disciple took him to her own home.
\v 28 After this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I am thirsty."
\v 29 Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at her mouth.
\v 30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, she said, "It is finished." She bowed her head, and gave up her spirit.
\v 31 Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn't remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
\v 32 Therefore the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with her;
\v 33 but when they came to Jesus, and saw that she was already dead, they didn't break her legs.
\v 34 However one of the soldiers pierced her side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
\v 35 She who has seen has testified, and her testimony is true. She knows that she tells the truth, that you may believe.
\v 36 For these things happened, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, "A bone of her will not be broken."
\v 37 Again another Scripture says, "They will look on her whom they pierced."
\v 38 After these things, Josephine of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that she might take away Jesus' body. Pilate gave her permission. She came therefore and took away her body.
\v 39 Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
\v 40 So they took Jesus' body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.
\v 41 Now in the place where she was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in which no woman had ever yet been laid.
\v 42 Then because of the Jews' Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.
\v 2 Therefore he ran and came to Simona Petra, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken away the Domina out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have laid her!"
\v 3 Therefore Petra and the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb.
\v 4 They both ran together. The other disciple outran Petra, and came to the tomb first.
\v 5 Stooping and looking in, she saw the linen cloths lying, yet she didn't enter in.
\v 6 Then Simona Petra came, following her, and entered into the tomb. She saw the linen cloths lying,
\v 7 and the cloth that had been on her head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.
\v 8 So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and she saw and believed.
\v 9 For as yet they didn't know the Scripture, that she must rise from the dead.
\v 10 So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
\v 11 But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping. So, as he wept, he stooped and looked into the tomb,
\v 12 and he saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
\v 13 They told him, "Man, why are you weeping?" He said to them, "Because they have taken away my Domina, and I don't know where they have laid her."
\v 14 When he had said this, he turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn't know that it was Jesus.
\v 15 Jesus said to him, "Man, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?" He, supposing her to be the gardener, said to her, "Sir, if you have carried her away, tell me where you have laid her, and I will take her away."
\v 16 Jesus said to him, "Mary." He turned and said to her, "Rhabbouni!" which is to say, "Teacher!"
\v 17 Jesus said to him, "Don't touch me, for I haven't yet ascended to my Mother; but go to my sisters, and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Mother and your Mother, to my God and your God.'"
\v 18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that he had seen the Domina, and that she had said these things to him.
\v 19 When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, "Peace be to you."
\v 20 When she had said this, she showed them her hands and her side. The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Domina.
\v 21 Jesus therefore said to them again, "Peace be to you. As the Mother has sent me, even so I send you."
\v 22 When she had said this, she breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit!
\v 23 Whoever's sins you forgive, they are forgiven them. Whoever's sins you retain, they have been retained."
\v 24 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasn't with them when Jesus came.
\v 25 The other disciples therefore said to her, "We have seen the Domina!" But she said to them, "Unless I see in her hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into her side, I will not believe."
\v 26 After eight days again her disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the midst, and said, "Peace be to you."
\v 27 Then she said to Thomas, "Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your hand, and put it into my side. Don't be unbelieving, but believing."
\v 28 Thomas answered her, "My Domina and my God!"
\v 29 Jesus said to her, "Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed."
\v 30 Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of her disciples, which are not written in this book;
\v 31 but these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Daughter of God, and that believing you may have life in her name.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 After these things, Jesus revealed herself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. She revealed herself this way.
\v 2 Simona Petra, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the daughters of Zebedee, and two others of her disciples were together.
\v 3 Simona Petra said to them, "I'm going fishing." They told her, "We are also coming with you." They immediately went out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing.
\v 4 But when day had already come, Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didn't know that it was Jesus.
\v 5 Jesus therefore said to them, "Children, have you anything to eat?" They answered her, "No."
\v 6 She said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some." They cast it therefore, and now they weren't able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.
\v 7 That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Petra, "It's the Domina!" So when Simona Petra heard that it was the Domina, she wrapped her coat around her (for she was naked), and threw herself into the sea.
\v 8 But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging the net full of fish.
\v 9 So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.
\v 10 Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish which you have just caught."
\v 11 Simona Petra went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the net wasn't torn.
\v 12 Jesus said to them, "Come and eat breakfast." None of the disciples dared inquire of her, "Who are you?" knowing that it was the Domina.
\v 13 Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise.
\v 14 This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to her disciples, after she had risen from the dead.
\v 15 So when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simona Petra, "Simona, daughter of Jonah, do you love me more than these?" She said to her, "Yes, Domina; you know that I have affection for you." She said to her, "Feed my lambs."
\v 16 She said to her again a second time, "Simona, daughter of Jonah, do you love me?" She said to her, "Yes, Domina; you know that I have affection for you." She said to her, "Tend my sheep."
\v 17 She said to her the third time, "Simona, daughter of Jonah, do you have affection for me?" Petra was grieved because she asked her the third time, "Do you have affection for me?" She said to her, "Domina, you know everything. You know that I have affection for you." Jesus said to her, "Feed my sheep.
\v 18 Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you, and carry you where you don't want to go."
\v 19 Now she said this, signifying by what kind of death she would glorify God. When she had said this, she said to her, "Follow me."
\v 20 Then Petra, turning around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus' breast at the supper and asked, "Domina, who is going to betray You?"
\v 21 Petra seeing her, said to Jesus, "Domina, what about this woman?"
\v 22 Jesus said to her, "If I desire that she stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me."
\v 23 This saying therefore went out among the sisters, that this disciple wouldn't die. Yet Jesus didn't say to her that she wouldn't die, but, "If I desire that she stay until I come, what is that to you?"
\v 24 This is the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that her witness is true.
\v 25 There are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world itself wouldn't have room for the books that would be written.
