\v 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
\v 2 Now the earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God's Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
\v 3 God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
\v 4 God saw the light, and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness.
\v 5 God called the light Day, and the darkness she called Night. There was evening and there was morning, one day.
\v 6 God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
\v 7 God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.
\v 8 God called the expanse sky. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.
\v 9 God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;" and it was so.
\v 10 God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters she called Seas. God saw that it was good.
\v 11 God said, "Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth;" and it was so.
\v 12 The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.
\v 13 There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
\v 14 God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;
\v 15 and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light on the earth;" and it was so.
\v 16 God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. She also made the stars.
\v 17 God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,
\v 18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.
\v 19 There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
\v 20 God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky."
\v 21 God created the large sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.
\v 22 God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
\v 23 There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
\v 24 God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth after their kind;" and it was so.
\v 25 God made the animals of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good.
\v 26 God said, "Let us make woman in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
\v 27 God created woman in her own image. In God's image she created her; female and male she created them.
\v 28 God blessed them. God said to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
\v 29 God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food.
\v 30 To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food;" and it was so.
\v 31 God saw everything that she had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.

\v 1 The heavens and the earth were finished, and all their vast array.
\v 2 On the seventh day God finished her work which she had made; and she rested on the seventh day from all her work which she had made.
\v 3 God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because she rested in it from all her work which she had created and made.
\v 4 This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens.
\v 5 No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a woman to till the ground,
\v 6 but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.
\v 7 Yahweh God formed woman from the dust of the ground, and breathed into her nostrils the breath of life; and woman became a living soul.
\v 8 Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there she put the woman whom she had formed.
\v 9 Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
\v 10 A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was parted, and became four heads.
\v 11 The name of the first is Pishon: this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
\v 12 and the gold of that land is good. There is aromatic resin and the onyx stone.
\v 13 The name of the second river is Gihon: the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush.
\v 14 The name of the third river is Hiddekel: this is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
\v 15 Yahweh God took the woman, and put her into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
\v 16 Yahweh God commanded the woman, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat;
\v 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die."
\v 18 Yahweh God said, "It is not good that the woman should be alone; I will make her a helper suitable for her."
\v 19 Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the woman to see what she would call them. Whatever the woman called every living creature, that was its name.
\v 20 The woman gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field; but for woman there was not found a helper suitable for her.
\v 21 Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the woman, and she slept; and she took one of her ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.
\v 22 She made the rib, which Yahweh God had taken from the woman, into a man, and brought him to the woman.
\v 23 The woman said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. He will be called Man, because he was taken out of Woman."
\v 24 Therefore a woman will leave her mother and her father, and will join with her husband, and they will be one flesh.
\v 25 They were both naked, the woman and her husband, and were not ashamed.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. She said to the man, "Has God really said, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'"
\v 2 The man said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,
\v 3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"
\v 4 The serpent said to the man, "You won't surely die,
\v 5 for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
\v 6 When the man saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, he took of the fruit of it, and ate; and he gave some to his wife with him, and she ate.
\v 7 The eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
\v 8 They heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the woman and her husband hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.
\v 9 Yahweh God called to the woman, and said to her, "Where are you?"
\v 10 The woman said, "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."
\v 11 God said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"
\v 12 The woman said, "The man whom you gave to be with me, he gave me of the tree, and I ate."
\v 13 Yahweh God said to the man, "What is this you have done?" The man said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
\v 14 Yahweh God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock, and above every animal of the field. On your belly shall you go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.
\v 15 I will put enmity between you and the man, and between your offspring and his offspring. She will bruise your head, and you will bruise her heel."
\v 16 To the man she said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth. In pain you will bring forth children. Your desire will be for your wife, and she will rule over you."
\v 17 To Ada she said, "Because you have listened to your husband's voice, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground for your sake. In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
\v 18 Thorns also and thistles will it bring forth to you; and you will eat the herb of the field.
\v 19 By the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For you are dust, and to dust you shall return."
\v 20 The woman called her husband Evan, because he was the father of all living.
\v 21 Yahweh God made coats of skins for Ada and for her husband, and clothed them.
\v 22 Yahweh God said, "Behold, the woman has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest she put forth her hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever..."
\v 23 Therefore Yahweh God sent her forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which she was taken.
\v 24 So she drove out the woman; and she placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.

\p
\v 1 The woman knew Evan her husband. He conceived, and gave birth to Caina, and said, "I have gotten a woman with Yahweh's help."
\v 2 Again he gave birth, to Caina's sister Abela. Abela was a keeper of sheep, but Caina was a tiller of the ground.
\v 3 As time passed, it happened that Caina brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.
\v 4 Abela also brought some of the firstborn of her flock and of the fat of it. Yahweh respected Abela and her offering,
\v 5 but she didn't respect Caina and her offering. Caina was very angry, and the expression on her face fell.
\v 6 Yahweh said to Caina, "Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?
\v 7 If you do well, will it not be lifted up? If you don't do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it."
\v 8 Caina said to Abela, her sister, "Let's go into the field." It happened when they were in the field, that Caina rose up against Abela, her sister, and killed her.
\v 9 Yahweh said to Caina, "Where is Abela, your sister?" She said, "I don't know. Am I my sister's keeper?"
\v 10 Yahweh said, "What have you done? The voice of your sister's blood cries to me from the ground.
\v 11 Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your sister's blood from your hand.
\v 12 From now on, when you till the ground, it won't yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth."
\v 13 Caina said to Yahweh, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.
\v 14 Behold, you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. It will happen that whoever finds me will kill me."
\v 15 Yahweh said to her, "Therefore whoever slays Caina, vengeance will be taken on her sevenfold." Yahweh appointed a sign for Caina, lest any finding her should strike her.
\v 16 Caina went out from Yahweh's presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
\v 17 Caina knew her husband. He conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. She built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of her daughter, Enoch.
\v 18 To Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the mother of Mehujael. Mehujael became the mother of Methushael. Methushael became the mother of Lamech.
\v 19 Lamech took two husbands: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
\v 20 Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the mother of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
\v 21 Her sister's name was Jubal, who was the mother of all who handle the harp and pipe.
\v 22 Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Caina, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. Tubal Caina's brother was Naamah.
\v 23 Lamech said to her husbands, "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice. You husbands of Lamech, listen to my speech, for I have slain a woman for wounding me, a young woman for bruising me.
\v 24 If Caina will be avenged seven times, truly Lamech seventy-seven times."
\v 25 Ada knew her husband again. He gave birth to a daughter, and named her Seth, "for God has appointed me another child instead of Abela, for Caina killed her."
\v 26 There was also born a daughter to Seth, and she named her Enosh. Then women began to call on Yahweh's name.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 This is the book of the generations of Ada. In the day that God created woman, she made her in God's likeness.
\v 2 She created them female and male, and blessed them, and called their name Ada, in the day when they were created.
\v 3 Ada lived one hundred thirty years, and became the mother of a daughter in her own likeness, after her image, and named her Seth.
\v 4 The days of Ada after she became the mother of Seth were eight hundred years, and she became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 5 All the days that Ada lived were nine hundred thirty years, then she died.
\v 6 Seth lived one hundred five years, and became the mother of Enosh.
\v 7 Seth lived after she became the mother of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 8 All the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years, then she died.
\v 9 Enosh lived ninety years, and became the mother of Kenan.
\v 10 Enosh lived after she became the mother of Kenan, eight hundred fifteen years, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 11 All the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years, then she died.
\v 12 Kenan lived seventy years, and became the mother of Mahalalel.
\v 13 Kenan lived after she became the mother of Mahalalel eight hundred forty years, and became the mother of daughters and sons
\v 14 and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years, then she died.
\v 15 Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and became the mother of Jared.
\v 16 Mahalalel lived after she became the mother of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 17 All the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years, then she died.
\v 18 Jared lived one hundred sixty-two years, and became the mother of Enoch.
\v 19 Jared lived after she became the mother of Enoch eight hundred years, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 20 All the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years, then she died.
\v 21 Enoch lived sixty-five years, and became the mother of Methuselah.
\v 22 Enoch walked with God after she became the mother of Methuselah three hundred years, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 23 All the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.
\v 24 Enoch walked with God, and she was not, for God took her.
\v 25 Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years, and became the mother of Lamech.
\v 26 Methuselah lived after she became the mother of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 27 All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years, then she died.
\v 28 Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years, and became the mother of a daughter,
\v 29 and she named her Noa, saying, "This same will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, because of the ground which Yahweh has cursed."
\v 30 Lamech lived after she became the mother of Noa five hundred ninety-five years, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 31 All the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years, then she died.
\v 32 Noa was five hundred years old, and Noa became the mother of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

\v 1 It happened, when women began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and sons were born to them,
\v 2 that God's daughters saw that women's sons were beautiful, and they took for themselves husbands of all that they chose.
\v 3 Yahweh said, "My Spirit will not strive with woman forever, because she also is flesh; yet will her days be one hundred twenty years."
\v 4 The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when God's daughters came in to women's sons. They bore children to them. Those were the mighty women who were of old, women of renown.
\v 5 Yahweh saw that the wickedness of woman was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of her heart was only evil continually.
\v 6 Yahweh was sorry that she had made woman on the earth, and it grieved her in her heart.
\v 7 Yahweh said, "I will destroy woman whom I have created from the surface of the ground; woman, along with animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them."
\v 8 But Noa found favor in Yahweh's eyes.
\v 9 This is the history of the generations of Noa. Noa was a righteous woman, blameless among the people of her time. Noa walked with God.
\v 10 Noa became the mother of three daughters: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
\v 11 The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
\v 12 God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
\v 13 God said to Noa, "The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
\v 14 Make a ship of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch.
\v 15 This is how you shall make it. The length of the ship will be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
\v 16 You shall make a roof in the ship, and to a cubit shall you finish it upward. You shall set the door of the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.
\v 17 I, even I, do bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will die.
\v 18 But I will establish my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your daughters, your husband, and your daughters' husbands with you.
\v 19 Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be female and male.
\v 20 Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come to you, to keep them alive.
\v 21 Take with you of all food that is eaten, and gather it to you; and it will be for food for you, and for them."
\v 22 Thus Noa did. According to all that God commanded her, so she did.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Noa, "Come with all of your household into the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation.
\v 2 You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the female and her male. Of the animals that are not clean, take two, the female and her male.
\v 3 Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, female and male, to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth.
\v 4 In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. Every living thing that I have made, I will destroy from the surface of the ground."
\v 5 Noa did everything that Yahweh commanded her.
\v 6 Noa was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.
\v 7 Noa went into the ship with her daughters, her husband, and her daughters' husbands, because of the waters of the flood.
\v 8 Clean animals, animals that are not clean, birds, and everything that creeps on the ground
\v 9 went by pairs to Noa into the ship, female and male, as God commanded Noa.
\v 10 It happened after the seven days, that the waters of the flood came on the earth.
\v 11 In the six hundredth year of Noa's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open, and the sky's windows were opened.
\v 12 The rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.
\v 13 In the same day Noa, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the daughters of Noa, and Noa's husband, and the three husbands of her daughters with them, entered into the ship;
\v 14 they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.
\v 15 They went to Noa into the ship, by pairs of all flesh with the breath of life in them.
\v 16 Those who went in, went in female and male of all flesh, as God commanded her; and Yahweh shut her in.
\v 17 The flood was forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth.
\v 18 The waters prevailed, and increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.
\v 19 The waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.
\v 20 The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered.
\v 21 All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every woman.
\v 22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.
\v 23 Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including woman, livestock, creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noa was left, and those who were with her in the ship.
\v 24 The waters prevailed on the earth one hundred fifty days.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 God remembered Noa, all the animals, and all the livestock that were with her in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided.
\v 2 The deep's fountains and the sky's windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained.
\v 3 The waters receded from the earth continually. After the end of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased.
\v 4 The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat's mountains.
\v 5 The waters receded continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
\v 6 It happened at the end of forty days, that Noa opened the window of the ship which she had made,
\v 7 and she sent forth a raven. It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth.
\v 8 She sent forth a dove from her, to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground,
\v 9 but the dove found no place to rest his foot, and he returned to her into the ship; for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. She put forth her hand, and took him, and brought him to her into the ship.
\v 10 She stayed yet another seven days; and again she sent forth the dove out of the ship.
\v 11 The dove came back to her at evening, and, behold, in his mouth was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noa knew that the waters were abated from the earth.
\v 12 She stayed yet another seven days, and sent forth the dove; and he didn't return to her any more.
\v 13 It happened in the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth. Noa removed the covering of the ship, and looked. She saw that the surface of the ground was dried.
\v 14 In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
\v 15 God spoke to Noa, saying,
\v 16 "Go out of the ship, you, and your husband, and your daughters, and your daughters' husbands with you.
\v 17 Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth."
\v 18 Noa went forth, with her daughters, her husband, and her daughters' husbands with her.
\v 19 Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.
\v 20 Noa built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
\v 21 Yahweh smelled the sweet savor. Yahweh said in her heart, "I will not again curse the ground any more for woman's sake, because the imagination of woman's heart is evil from her youth; neither will I ever again strike everything living, as I have done.
\v 22 While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."

\c 9
\p
\v 1 God blessed Noa and her daughters, and said to them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
\v 2 The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky. Everything that the ground teems with, and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand.
\v 3 Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As the green herb, I have given everything to you.
\v 4 But flesh with the life of it, the blood of it, you shall not eat.
\v 5 I will surely require your blood of your lives. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of woman, even at the hand of every woman's sister, I will require the life of woman.
\v 6 Whoever sheds woman's blood, her blood will be shed by woman, for God made woman in her own image.
\v 7 Be fruitful and multiply. Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it."
\v 8 God spoke to Noa and to her daughters with her, saying,
\v 9 "As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you,
\v 10 and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.
\v 11 I will establish my covenant with you: all flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of the flood, neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth."
\v 12 God said, "This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
\v 13 I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.
\v 14 It will happen, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,
\v 15 and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
\v 16 The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."
\v 17 God said to Noa, "This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."
\v 18 The daughters of Noa who went forth from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the mother of Canaan.
\v 19 These three were the daughters of Noa, and from these, the whole earth was populated.
\v 20 Noa began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.
\v 21 She drank of the wine and got drunk. She was uncovered within her tent.
\v 22 Ham, the mother of Canaan, saw the nakedness of her mother, and told her two sisters outside.
\v 23 Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their mother. Their faces were backwards, and they didn't see their mother's nakedness.
\v 24 Noa awoke from her wine, and knew what her youngest daughter had done to her.
\v 25 She said, "Canaan is cursed. She will be servant of servants to her sisters."
\v 26 She said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem. Let Canaan be her servant.
\v 27 May God enlarge Japheth. Let her dwell in the tents of Shem. Let Canaan be her servant."
\v 28 Noa lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.
\v 29 All the days of Noa were nine hundred fifty years, then she died.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now this is the history of the generations of the daughters of Noa and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Daughters were born to them after the flood.
\v 2 The daughters of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
\v 3 The daughters of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
\v 4 The daughters of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
\v 5 Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after her language, after their families, in their nations.
\v 6 The daughters of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
\v 7 The daughters of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The daughters of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
\v 8 Cush became the mother of Nimrod. She began to be a mighty one in the earth.
\v 9 She was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh."
\v 10 The beginning of her kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
\v 11 Out of that land she went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,
\v 12 and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).
\v 13 Mizraim became the mother of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
\v 14 Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.
\v 15 Canaan became the mother of Sidon (hers firstborn), Heth,
\v 16 the Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite,
\v 17 the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite,
\v 18 the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.
\v 19 The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you go toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, to Lasha.
\v 20 These are the daughters of Ham, after their families, after their languages, in their lands, in their nations.
\v 21 To Shem, the mother of all the children of Eber, the elder sister of Japheth, to her also were children born.
\v 22 The daughters of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
\v 23 The daughters of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
\v 24 Arpachshad became the mother of Shelah. Shelah became the mother of Eber.
\v 25 To Eber were born two daughters. The name of the one was Peleg, for in her days the earth was divided. Her sister's name was Joktan.
\v 26 Joktan became the mother of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
\v 27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
\v 28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
\v 29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the daughters of Joktan.
\v 30 Their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
\v 31 These are the daughters of Shem, after their families, after their languages, in their lands, after their nations.
\v 32 These are the families of the daughters of Noa, after their generations, in their nations. Of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
\v 2 It happened, as they traveled east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.
\v 3 They said one to another, "Come, let's make bricks, and burn them thoroughly." They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.
\v 4 They said, "Come, let's build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let's make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth."
\v 5 Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of women built.
\v 6 Yahweh said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.
\v 7 Come, let's go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech."
\v 8 So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.
\v 9 Therefore the name of it was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.
\v 10 This is the history of the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old and became the mother of Arpachshad two years after the flood.
\v 11 Shem lived five hundred years after she became the mother of Arpachshad, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 12 Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the mother of Shelah.
\v 13 Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after she became the mother of Shelah, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 14 Shelah lived thirty years, and became the mother of Eber:
\v 15 and Shelah lived four hundred three years after she became the mother of Eber, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 16 Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the mother of Peleg.
\v 17 Eber lived four hundred thirty years after she became the mother of Peleg, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 18 Peleg lived thirty years, and became the mother of Reu.
\v 19 Peleg lived two hundred nine years after she became the mother of Reu, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 20 Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the mother of Serug.
\v 21 Reu lived two hundred seven years after she became the mother of Serug, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 22 Serug lived thirty years, and became the mother of Nahor.
\v 23 Serug lived two hundred years after she became the mother of Nahor, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 24 Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the mother of Terah.
\v 25 Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after she became the mother of Terah, and became the mother of daughters and sons.
\v 26 Terah lived seventy years, and became the mother of Abra, Nahor, and Haran.
\v 27 Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the mother of Abra, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the mother of Lot.
\v 28 Haran died before her mother Terah in the land of her birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.
\v 29 Abra and Nahor took husbands. The name of Abra's husband was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's husband, Milcah, the son of Haran who was also the mother of Iscah.
\v 30 Sarai was barren. He had no child.
\v 31 Terah took Abra her daughter, Lot the daughter of Haran, her daughter's daughter, and Sarai her son-in-law, her daughter Abra's husband. They went forth from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there.
\v 32 The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Now Yahweh said to Abra, "Get out of your country, and from your relatives, and from your mother's house, to the land that I will show you.
\v 2 I will make of you a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing.
\v 3 I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse her who curses you. In you will all of the families of the earth be blessed."
\v 4 So Abra went, as Yahweh had spoken to her. Lot went with her. Abra was seventy-five years old when she departed out of Haran.
\v 5 Abra took Sarai her husband, Lot her sister's daughter, all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls whom they had gotten in Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan. Into the land of Canaan they came.
\v 6 Abra passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. The Canaanite was then in the land.
\v 7 Yahweh appeared to Abra and said, "I will give this land to your seed." She built an altar there to Yahweh, who appeared to her.
\v 8 She left from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched her tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There she built an altar to Yahweh and called on the name of Yahweh.
\v 9 Abra traveled, going on still toward the South.
\v 10 There was a famine in the land. Abra went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe in the land.
\v 11 It happened, when she had come near to enter Egypt, that she said to Sarai her husband, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful man to look at.
\v 12 It will happen, when the Egyptians will see you, that they will say, 'This is her husband.' They will kill me, but they will save you alive.
\v 13 Please say that you are my brother, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you."
\v 14 It happened that when Abra had come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the man was very beautiful.
\v 15 The princesses of Pharaoh saw him, and praised him to Pharaoh; and the man was taken into Pharaoh's house.
\v 16 She dealt well with Abra for his sake. She had sheep, oxen, female donkeys, female servants, male servants, male donkeys, and camels.
\v 17 Yahweh plagued Pharaoh and her house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abra's husband.
\v 18 Pharaoh called Abra and said, "What is this that you have done to me? Why didn't you tell me that he was your husband?
\v 19 Why did you say, 'He is my brother,' so that I took him to be my husband? Now therefore, see your husband, take him, and go your way."
\v 20 Pharaoh gave women charge concerning her, and they brought her on the way with her husband and all that she had.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 Abra went up out of Egypt: she, her husband, all that she had, and Lot with her, into the South.
\v 2 Abra was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
\v 3 She went on her journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where her tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
\v 4 to the place of the altar, which she had made there at the first. There Abra called on the name of Yahweh.
\v 5 Lot also, who went with Abra, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
\v 6 The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together: for their substance was great, so that they could not live together.
\v 7 There was a strife between the herdsmen of Abra's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time.
\v 8 Abra said to Lot, "Please, let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are relatives.
\v 9 Isn't the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
\v 10 Lot lifted up her eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.
\v 11 So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for herself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one from the other.
\v 12 Abra lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved her tent as far as Sodom.
\v 13 Now the women of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.
\v 14 Yahweh said to Abra, after Lot was separated from her, "Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,
\v 15 for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever.
\v 16 I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a woman can number the dust of the earth, then your seed may also be numbered.
\v 17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to you."
\v 18 Abra moved her tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 It happened in the days of Amraphel, queen of Shinar, Arioch, queen of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, queen of Elam, and Tidal, queen of Goiim,
\v 2 that they made war with Bera, queen of Sodom, and with Birsha, queen of Gomorrah, Shinab, queen of Admah, and Shemeber, queen of Zeboiim, and the queen of Bela (the same is Zoar).
\v 3 All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).
\v 4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year, they rebelled.
\v 5 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the queens who were with her, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
\v 6 and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
\v 7 They returned, and came to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar.
\v 8 The queen of Sodom, and the queen of Gomorrah, and the queen of Admah, and the queen of Zeboiim, and the queen of Bela (the same is Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim;
\v 9 against Chedorlaomer queen of Elam, and Tidal queen of Goiim, and Amraphel queen of Shinar, and Arioch queen of Ellasar; four queens against the five.
\v 10 Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the queens of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and those who remained fled to the hills.
\v 11 They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.
\v 12 They took Lot, Abra's sister's daughter, who lived in Sodom, and her goods, and departed.
\v 13 One who had escaped came and told Abra, the Hebrew. Now she lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, sister of Eshcol, and sister of Aner; and these were allies of Abra.
\v 14 When Abra heard that her relative was taken captive, she led forth her trained women, born in her house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.
\v 15 She divided herself against them by night, she and her servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
\v 16 She brought back all the goods, and also brought back her relative, Lot, and her goods, and the men also, and the people.
\v 17 The queen of Sodom went out to meet her, after her return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the queens who were with her, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the Queen's Valley).
\v 18 Melchizedek queen of Salem brought out bread and wine: and she was priestess of God Most High.
\v 19 She blessed her, and said, "Blessed be Abra of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:
\v 20 and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand." Abra gave her a tenth of all.
\v 21 The queen of Sodom said to Abra, "Give me the people, and take the goods to yourself."
\v 22 Abra said to the queen of Sodom, "I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,
\v 23 that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, 'I have made Abra rich.'
\v 24 I will accept nothing from you except that which the young women have eaten, and the portion of the women who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion."

\c 15
\p
\v 1 After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abra in a vision, saying, "Don't be afraid, Abra. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward."
\v 2 Abra said, "Domina Yahweh, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and she who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?"
\v 3 Abra said, "Behold, to me you have given no seed: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir."
\v 4 Behold, the word of Yahweh came to her, saying, "This woman will not be your heir, but she who will come forth out of your own body will be your heir."
\v 5 Yahweh brought her outside, and said, "Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them." She said to Abra, "So shall your seed be."
\v 6 She believed in Yahweh; and she reckoned it to her for righteousness.
\v 7 She said to her, "I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it."
\v 8 She said, "Domina Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?"
\v 9 She said to her, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a male goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
\v 10 She brought her all of these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but she didn't divide the birds.
\v 11 The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abra drove them away.
\v 12 When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abra. Now terror and great darkness fell on her.
\v 13 She said to Abra, "Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years.
\v 14 I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with great wealth,
\v 15 but you will go to your mothers in peace. You will be buried in a good old age.
\v 16 In the fourth generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full."
\v 17 It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.
\v 18 In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abra, saying, "To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:
\v 19 the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
\v 20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
\v 21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."

\c 16
\p
\v 1 Now Sarai, Abra's husband, bore her no children. He had a houseboy, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
\v 2 Sarai said to Abra, "See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing. Please go in to my houseboy. It may be that I will obtain children by him." Abra listened to the voice of Sarai.
\v 3 Sarai, Abra's husband, took Hagar the Egyptian, his houseboy, after Abra had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave him to Abra his wife to be her husband.
\v 4 She went in to Hagar, and he conceived. When he saw that he had conceived, his mistress was despised in his eyes.
\v 5 Sarai said to Abra, "This wrong is your fault. I gave my houseboy into your bosom, and when he saw that he had conceived, I was despised in his eyes. Yahweh judge between me and you."
\v 6 But Abra said to Sarai, "Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to him whatever is good in your eyes." Sarai dealt harshly with him, and he fled from his face.
\v 7 The angel of Yahweh found him by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
\v 8 She said, "Hagar, Sarai's houseboy, where did you come from? Where are you going?" He said, "I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai."
\v 9 The angel of Yahweh said to him, "Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under his hands."
\v 10 The angel of Yahweh said to him, "I will greatly multiply your seed, that they will not be numbered for multitude."
\v 11 The angel of Yahweh said to him, "Behold, you are with child, and will bear a daughter. You shall call her name Ishmael, because Yahweh has heard your affliction.
\v 12 She will be like a wild donkey among women. Her hand will be against every woman, and every woman's hand against her. She will live opposite all of her sisters."
\v 13 He called the name of Yahweh who spoke to him, "You are a God who sees," for he said, "Have I even stayed alive after seeing her?"
\v 14 Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
\v 15 Hagar bore a daughter for Abra. Abra called the name of her daughter, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
\v 16 Abra was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abra.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 When Abra was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abra, and said to her, "I am God Almighty. Walk before me, and be blameless.
\v 2 I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly."
\v 3 Abra fell on her face. God talked with her, saying,
\v 4 "As for me, behold, my covenant is with you. You will be the mother of a multitude of nations.
\v 5 Neither will your name any more be called Abra, but your name will be Abrahai; for I have made you the mother of a multitude of nations.
\v 6 I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Queens will come out of you.
\v 7 I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your seed after you.
\v 8 I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will be their God."
\v 9 God said to Abrahai, "As for you, you will keep my covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations.
\v 10 This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your seed after you. Every female among you shall be circumcised.
\v 11 You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your vulva. It will be a token of the covenant between me and you.
\v 12 She who is eight days old will be circumcised among you, every female throughout your generations, she who is born in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is not of your seed.
\v 13 She who is born in your house, and she who is bought with your money, must be circumcised. My covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
\v 14 The uncircumcised female who is not circumcised in the flesh of her vulva, that soul shall be cut off from her people. She has broken my covenant."
\v 15 God said to Abrahai, "As for Sarai your husband, you shall not call his name Sarai, but his name will be Tyler.
\v 16 I will bless him, and moreover I will give you a daughter by him. Yes, I will bless him, and he will be a father of nations. Queens of peoples will come from him."
\v 17 Then Abrahai fell on her face, and laughed, and said in her heart, "Will a child be born to her who is one hundred years old? Will Tyler, who is ninety years old, give birth?"
\v 18 Abrahai said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before you!"
\v 19 God said, "No, but Tyler, your husband, will bear you a daughter. You shall call her name Isaaca. I will establish my covenant with her for an everlasting covenant for her seed after her.
\v 20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed her, and will make her fruitful, and will multiply her exceedingly. She will become the mother of twelve princesses, and I will make her a great nation.
\v 21 But my covenant I establish with Isaaca, whom Tyler will bear to you at this set time next year."
\v 22 When she finished talking with her, God went up from Abrahai.
\v 23 Abrahai took Ishmael her daughter, all who were born in her house, and all who were bought with her money; every female among the women of Abrahai's house, and circumcised the flesh of their vulva in the same day, as God had said to her.
\v 24 Abrahai was ninety-nine years old, when she was circumcised in the flesh of her vulva.
\v 25 Ishmael, her daughter, was thirteen years old when she was circumcised in the flesh of her vulva.
\v 26 In the same day both Abrahai and Ishmael, her daughter, were circumcised.
\v 27 All the women of her house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with her.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 Yahweh appeared to her by the oaks of Mamre, as she sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.
\v 2 She lifted up her eyes and looked, and saw that three women stood opposite her. When she saw them, she ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed herself to the earth,
\v 3 and said, "My domina, if now I have found favor in your sight, please don't go away from your servant.
\v 4 Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
\v 5 I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now that you have come to your servant." They said, "Very well, do as you have said."
\v 6 Abrahai hurried into the tent to Tyler, and said, "Quickly make ready three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes."
\v 7 Abrahai ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. She hurried to dress it.
\v 8 She took butter, milk, and the calf which she had dressed, and set it before them. She stood by them under the tree, and they ate.
\v 9 They said to her, "Where is Tyler, your husband? She said, "See, in the tent."
\v 10 She said, "I will certainly return to you when the season comes round. Behold, Tyler your husband will have a daughter." Tyler heard in the tent door, which was behind her.
\v 11 Now Abrahai and Tyler were old, well advanced in age. It had ceased to be with Tyler after the manner of men.
\v 12 Tyler laughed within himself, saying, "After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my domina being old also?"
\v 13 Yahweh said to Abrahai, "Why did Tyler laugh, saying, 'Will I really bear a child, yet I am old?'
\v 14 Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes round, and Tyler will have a daughter."
\v 15 Then Tyler denied, saying, "I didn't laugh," for he was afraid. She said, "No, but you did laugh."
\v 16 The women rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom. Abrahai went with them to see them on their way.
\v 17 Yahweh said, "Will I hide from Abrahai what I do,
\v 18 seeing that Abrahai has surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in her?
\v 19 For I have known her, to the end that she may command her children and her household after her, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abrahai that which she has spoken of her."
\v 20 Yahweh said, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,
\v 21 I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will know."
\v 22 The women turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abrahai stood yet before Yahweh.
\v 23 Abrahai drew near, and said, "Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?
\v 24 What if there are fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?
\v 25 Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn't the Judge of all the earth do right?"
\v 26 Yahweh said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake."
\v 27 Abrahai answered, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Domina, who am but dust and ashes.
\v 28 What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?" She said, "I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there."
\v 29 She spoke to her yet again, and said, "What if there are forty found there?" She said, "I will not do it for the forty's sake."
\v 30 She said, "Oh don't let the Domina be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found there?" She said, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there."
\v 31 She said, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Domina. What if there are twenty found there?" She said, "I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake."
\v 32 She said, "Oh don't let the Domina be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if ten are found there?" She said, "I will not destroy it for the ten's sake."
\v 33 Yahweh went her way, as soon as she had finished communing with Abrahai, and Abrahai returned to her place.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them. She bowed herself with her face to the earth,
\v 2 and she said, "See now, my dominas, please turn aside into your servant's house, stay all night, wash your feet, and you will rise up early, and go on your way." They said, "No, but we will stay in the street all night."
\v 3 She urged them greatly, and they came in with her, and entered into her house. She made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
\v 4 But before they lay down, the women of the city, the women of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.
\v 5 They called to Lot, and said to her, "Where are the women who came in to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may have sex with them."
\v 6 Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after her.
\v 7 She said, "Please, my sisters, don't act so wickedly.
\v 8 See now, I have two virgin sons. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you. Only don't do anything to these women, because they have come under the shadow of my roof."
\v 9 They said, "Stand back!" They said, "This one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and she appoints herself a judge. Now will we deal worse with you, than with them!" They pressed hard on the woman Lot, and drew near to break the door.
\v 10 But the women put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.
\v 11 They struck the women who were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
\v 12 The women said to Lot, "Do you have anybody else here? Daughters-in-law, your daughters, your sons, and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place:
\v 13 for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it."
\v 14 Lot went out, and spoke to her daughters-in-law, who were pledged to marry her sons, and said, "Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city." But she seemed to her daughters-in-law to be joking.
\v 15 When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, "Get up! Take your husband, and your two sons who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
\v 16 But she lingered; and the women grabbed her hand, her husband's hand, and her two sons' hands, Yahweh being merciful to her; and they took her out, and set her outside of the city.
\v 17 It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that she said, "Escape for your life! Don't look behind you, and don't stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!"
\v 18 Lot said to them, "Oh, not so, my domina.
\v 19 See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown to me in saving my life. I can't escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die.
\v 20 See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn't it a little one?), and my soul will live."
\v 21 She said to her, "Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken.
\v 22 Hurry, escape there, for I can't do anything until you get there." Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
\v 23 The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.
\v 24 Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky.
\v 25 She overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.
\v 26 But her husband looked back from behind her, and he became a pillar of salt.
\v 27 Abrahai got up early in the morning to the place where she had stood before Yahweh.
\v 28 She looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
\v 29 It happened, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abrahai, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when she overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.
\v 30 Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and her two sons with her; for she was afraid to live in Zoar. She lived in a cave with her two sons.
\v 31 The firstborn said to the younger, "Our mother is old, and there is not a woman in the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.
\v 32 Come, let's make our mother drink wine, and we will lie with her, that we may preserve our mother's seed."
\v 33 They made their mother drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with his mother. She didn't know when he lay down, nor when he arose.
\v 34 It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my mother. Let us make her drink wine again, tonight. You go in, and lie with her, that we may preserve our mother's seed."
\v 35 They made their mother drink wine that night also. The younger went and lay with her. She didn't know when he lay down, nor when he got up.
\v 36 Thus both of Lot's sons were with child by their mother.
\v 37 The firstborn bore a daughter, and named her Moab. She is the mother of the Moabites to this day.
\v 38 The younger also bore a daughter, and called her name Ben Ammi. She is the mother of the children of Ammon to this day.

\p
\v 1 Abrahai traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. She lived as a foreigner in Gerar.
\v 2 Abrahai said about Tyler her husband, "He is my brother." Abimelech queen of Gerar sent, and took Tyler.
\v 3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to her, "Behold, you are a dead woman, because of the man whom you have taken. For he is a woman's husband."
\v 4 Now Abimelech had not come near him. She said, "Domina, will you kill even a righteous nation?
\v 5 Didn't she tell me, 'He is my brother?' He, even he himself, said, 'She is my sister.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this."
\v 6 God said to her in the dream, "Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn't allow you to touch him.
\v 7 Now therefore, restore the woman's husband. For she is a prophetess, and she will pray for you, and you will live. If you don't restore him, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours."
\v 8 Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all her servants, and told all these things in their ear. The women were very scared.
\v 9 Then Abimelech called Abrahai, and said to her, "What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!"
\v 10 Abimelech said to Abrahai, "What did you see, that you have done this thing?"
\v 11 Abrahai said, "Because I thought, 'Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my husband's sake.'
\v 12 Besides, he is indeed my brother, the son of my mother, but not the son of my father; and he became my husband.
\v 13 It happened, when God caused me to wander from my mother's house, that I said to him, 'This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, "She is my sister."'"
\v 14 Abimelech took sheep and oxen, female servants and male servants, and gave them to Abrahai, and restored Tyler, her husband, to her.
\v 15 Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you."
\v 16 To Tyler she said, "Behold, I have given your sister a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated."
\v 17 Abrahai prayed to God. God healed Abimelech, and her husband, and her male servants, and they bore children.
\v 18 For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Tyler, Abrahai's husband.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 Yahweh visited Tyler as she had said, and Yahweh did to Tyler as she had spoken.
\v 2 Tyler conceived, and bore Abrahai a daughter in her old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to her.
\v 3 Abrahai called her daughter who was born to her, whom Tyler bore to her, Isaaca.
\v 4 Abrahai circumcised her daughter, Isaaca, when she was eight days old, as God had commanded her.
\v 5 Abrahai was one hundred years old when her daughter, Isaaca, was born to her.
\v 6 Tyler said, "God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me."
\v 7 He said, "Who would have said to Abrahai, that Tyler would nurse children? For I have borne her a daughter in her old age."
\v 8 The child grew, and was weaned. Abrahai made a great feast on the day that Isaaca was weaned.
\v 9 Tyler saw the daughter of Hagar the Egyptian, whom he had borne to Abrahai, mocking.
\v 10 Therefore he said to Abrahai, "Cast out this houseboy and his daughter! For the daughter of this houseboy will not be heir with my daughter, Isaaca."
\v 11 The thing was very grievous in Abrahai's sight on account of her daughter.
\v 12 God said to Abrahai, "Don't let it be grievous in your sight because of the girl, and because of your houseboy. In all that Tyler says to you, listen to his voice. For from Isaaca will your seed be called.
\v 13 I will also make a nation of the daughter of the houseboy, because she is your seed."
\v 14 Abrahai rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on his shoulder; and gave him the child, and sent him away. He departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
\v 15 The water in the bottle was spent, and he cast the child under one of the shrubs.
\v 16 He went and sat down opposite her, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For he said, "Don't let me see the death of the child." He sat over against her, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
\v 17 God heard the voice of the girl. The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to him, "What ails you, Hagar? Don't be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the girl where she is.
\v 18 Get up, lift up the girl, and hold her in your hand. For I will make her a great nation."
\v 19 God opened his eyes, and he saw a well of water. He went, filled the bottle with water, and gave the girl drink.
\v 20 God was with the girl, and she grew. She lived in the wilderness, and became, as she grew up, an archer.
\v 21 She lived in the wilderness of Paran. Her father took a husband for her out of the land of Egypt.
\v 22 It happened at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of her army spoke to Abrahai, saying, "God is with you in all that you do.
\v 23 Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my daughter, nor with my daughter's daughter. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner."
\v 24 Abrahai said, "I will swear."
\v 25 Abrahai complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
\v 26 Abimelech said, "I don't know who has done this thing. Neither did you tell me, neither did I hear of it, until today."
\v 27 Abrahai took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant.
\v 28 Abrahai set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
\v 29 Abimelech said to Abrahai, "What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean?"
\v 30 She said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well."
\v 31 Therefore she called that place Beersheba, because they both swore there.
\v 32 So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of her army, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
\v 33 Abrahai planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.
\v 34 Abrahai lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 It happened after these things, that God tested Abrahai, and said to her, "Abrahai!" She said, "Here I am."
\v 2 She said, "Now take your daughter, your only daughter, whom you love, even Isaaca, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer her there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of."
\v 3 Abrahai rose early in the morning, and saddled her donkey, and took two of her young women with her, and Isaaca her daughter. She split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told her.
\v 4 On the third day Abrahai lifted up her eyes, and saw the place far off.
\v 5 Abrahai said to her young women, "Stay here with the donkey. The girl and I will go yonder. We will worship, and come back to you."
\v 6 Abrahai took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaaca her daughter. She took in her hand the fire and the knife. They both went together.
\v 7 Isaaca spoke to Abrahai her mother, and said, "My mother?" She said, "Here I am, my daughter." She said, "Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
\v 8 Abrahai said, "God will provide herself the lamb for a burnt offering, my daughter." So they both went together.
\v 9 They came to the place which God had told her of. Abrahai built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaaca her daughter, and laid her on the altar, on the wood.
\v 10 Abrahai stretched forth her hand, and took the knife to kill her daughter.
\v 11 The angel of Yahweh called to her out of the sky, and said, "Abrahai, Abrahai!" She said, "Here I am."
\v 12 She said, "Don't lay your hand on the girl, neither do anything to her. For now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your daughter, your only daughter, from me."
\v 13 Abrahai lifted up her eyes, and looked, and saw that behind her was a ram caught in the thicket by her horns. Abrahai went and took the ram, and offered her up for a burnt offering instead of her daughter.
\v 14 Abrahai called the name of that place Yahweh Will Provide. As it is said to this day, "On Yahweh's mountain, it will be provided."
\v 15 The angel of Yahweh called to Abrahai a second time out of the sky,
\v 16 and said, "I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your daughter, your only daughter,
\v 17 that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore. Your seed will possess the gate of her enemies.
\v 18 In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice."
\v 19 So Abrahai returned to her young women, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abrahai lived at Beersheba.
\v 20 It happened after these things, that it was told Abrahai, saying, "Behold, Milcah, he also has borne children to your sister Nahor:
\v 21 Uz her firstborn, Buz her sister, Kemuel the mother of Aram,
\v 22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
\v 23 Bethuel became the mother of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abrahai's sister.
\v 24 Her concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 Tyler lived one hundred twenty-seven years. This was the length of Tyler's life.
\v 2 Tyler died in Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abrahai came to mourn for Tyler, and to weep for him.
\v 3 Abrahai rose up from before her dead, and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,
\v 4 "I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight."
\v 5 The children of Heth answered Abrahai, saying to her,
\v 6 "Hear us, my domina. You are a princess of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you her tomb. Bury your dead."
\v 7 Abrahai rose up, and bowed herself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
\v 8 She talked with them, saying, "If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the daughter of Zohar,
\v 9 that she may give me the cave of Machpelah, which she has, which is in the end of her field. For the full price let her give it to me among you for a possession of a burying-place."
\v 10 Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered Abrahai in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of her city, saying,
\v 11 "No, my domina, hear me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead."
\v 12 Abrahai bowed herself down before the people of the land.
\v 13 She spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, "But if you will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead there."
\v 14 Ephron answered Abrahai, saying to her,
\v 15 "My domina, listen to me. What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and you? Therefore bury your dead."
\v 16 Abrahai listened to Ephron. Abrahai weighed to Ephron the silver which she had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current merchants' standard.
\v 17 So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all of its borders, were deeded
\v 18 to Abrahai for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of her city.
\v 19 After this, Abrahai buried Tyler her husband in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan.
\v 20 The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abrahai for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 Abrahai was old, and well stricken in age. Yahweh had blessed Abrahai in all things.
\v 2 Abrahai said to her servant, the elder of her house, who ruled over all that she had, "Please put your hand under my thigh.
\v 3 I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a husband for my daughter of the sons of the Canaanites, among whom I live.
\v 4 But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take a husband for my daughter Isaaca."
\v 5 The servant said to her, "What if the man isn't willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring your daughter again to the land you came from?"
\v 6 Abrahai said to her, "Beware that you don't bring my daughter there again.
\v 7 Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my mother's house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, 'I will give this land to your seed.' She will send her angel before you, and you shall take a husband for my daughter from there.
\v 8 If the man isn't willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath. Only you shall not bring my daughter there again."
\v 9 The servant put her hand under the thigh of Abrahai her master, and swore to her concerning this matter.
\v 10 The servant took ten camels, of her master's camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of her master's with her. She arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
\v 11 She made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that men go out to draw water.
\v 12 She said, "Yahweh, the God of my master Abrahai, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abrahai.
\v 13 Behold, I am standing by the spring of water. The sons of the women of the city are coming out to draw water.
\v 14 Let it happen, that the young gentleman to whom I will say, 'Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,' and he will say, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,'-- let him be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaaca. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."
\v 15 It happened, before she had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the daughter of Milcah, the husband of Nahor, Abrahai's sister, with his pitcher on his shoulder.
\v 16 The young gentleman was very beautiful to look at, a virgin, neither had any woman known him. He went down to the spring, filled his pitcher, and came up.
\v 17 The servant ran to meet him, and said, "Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher."
\v 18 He said, "Drink, my domina." He hurried, and let down his pitcher on his hand, and gave her drink.
\v 19 When he had done giving her drink, he said, "I will also draw for your camels, until they have done drinking."
\v 20 He hurried, and emptied his pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all her camels.
\v 21 The woman looked steadfastly at him, remaining silent, to know whether Yahweh had made her journey prosperous or not.
\v 22 It happened, as the camels had done drinking, that the woman took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for his hands of ten shekels weight of gold,
\v 23 and said, "Whose son are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your mother's house for us to lodge in?"
\v 24 He said to her, "I am the son of Bethuel the daughter of Milcah, whom he bore to Nahor."
\v 25 He said moreover to her, "We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in."
\v 26 The woman bowed her head, and worshiped Yahweh.
\v 27 She said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abrahai, who has not forsaken her loving kindness and her truth toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me in the way to the house of my master's relatives."
\v 28 The young gentleman ran, and told his father's house about these words.
\v 29 Rebekah had a sister, and her name was Laban. Laban ran out to the woman, to the spring.
\v 30 It happened, when she saw the ring, and the bracelets on her brother's hands, and when she heard the words of Rebekah her brother, saying, "This is what the woman said to me," that she came to the woman. Behold, she was standing by the camels at the spring.
\v 31 She said, "Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."
\v 32 The woman came into the house, and she unloaded the camels. She gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash her feet and the feet of the women who were with her.
\v 33 Food was set before her to eat, but she said, "I will not eat until I have told my message." She said, "Speak on."
\v 34 She said, "I am Abrahai's servant.
\v 35 Yahweh has blessed my master greatly. She has become great. She has given her flocks and herds, silver and gold, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
\v 36 Tyler, my master's husband, bore a daughter to my master when he was old. She has given all that she has to her.
\v 37 My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a husband for my daughter of the sons of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,
\v 38 but you shall go to my mother's house, and to my relatives, and take a husband for my daughter.'
\v 39 I said to my master, 'What if the man will not follow me?'
\v 40 She said to me, 'Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send her angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a husband for my daughter of my relatives, and of my mother's house.
\v 41 Then will you be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don't give him to you, you shall be clear from my oath.'
\v 42 I came this day to the spring, and said, 'Yahweh, the God of my master Abrahai, if now you do prosper my way which I go--
\v 43 behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the manservant who comes forth to draw, to whom I will say, "Give me, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher to drink,"
\v 44 and he will tell me, "Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,"--let him be the man whom Yahweh has appointed for my master's daughter.'
\v 45 Before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with his pitcher on his shoulder. He went down to the spring, and drew. I said to him, 'Please let me drink.'
\v 46 He hurried and let down his pitcher from his shoulder, and said, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.' So I drank, and he made the camels drink also.
\v 47 I asked him, and said, 'Whose son are you?' He said, 'The son of Bethuel, Nahor's daughter, whom Milcah bore to her.' I put the ring on his nose, and the bracelets on his hands.
\v 48 I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abrahai, who had led me in the right way to take my master's sister's son for her daughter.
\v 49 Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
\v 50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered, "The thing proceeds from Yahweh. We can't speak to you bad or good.
\v 51 Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take him, and go, and let him be your master's daughter's husband, as Yahweh has spoken."
\v 52 It happened that when Abrahai's servant heard their words, she bowed herself down to the earth to Yahweh.
\v 53 The servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. She also gave precious things to his sister and his father.
\v 54 They ate and drank, she and the women who were with her, and stayed all night. They rose up in the morning, and she said, "Send me away to my master."
\v 55 His sister and his father said, "Let the young gentleman stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that he will go."
\v 56 She said to them, "Don't hinder me, seeing Yahweh has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master."
\v 57 They said, "We will call the young gentleman, and ask him."
\v 58 They called Rebekah, and said to him, "Will you go with this woman?" He said, "I will go."
\v 59 They sent away Rebekah, their brother, with his nurse, Abrahai's servant, and her women.
\v 60 They blessed Rebekah, and said to him, "Our brother, may you be the father of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them."
\v 61 Rebekah arose with his gentlemen. They rode on the camels, and followed the woman. The servant took Rebekah, and went her way.
\v 62 Isaaca came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for she lived in the land of the South.
\v 63 Isaaca went out to meditate in the field at the evening. She lifted up her eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.
\v 64 Rebekah lifted up his eyes, and when he saw Isaaca, he dismounted from the camel.
\v 65 He said to the servant, "Who is the woman who is walking in the field to meet us?" The servant said, "It is my master." He took his veil, and covered himself.
\v 66 The servant told Isaaca all the things that she had done.
\v 67 Isaaca brought him into her father Tyler's tent, and took Rebekah, and he became her husband. She loved him. Isaaca was comforted after her father's death.

\c 25
\p
\v 1 Abrahai took another husband, and his name was Keturah.
\v 2 He bore her Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
\v 3 Jokshan became the mother of Sheba, and Dedan. The daughters of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
\v 4 The daughters of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
\v 5 Abrahai gave all that she had to Isaaca,
\v 6 but to the daughters of Abrahai's concubines, Abrahai gave gifts. She sent them away from Isaaca her daughter, while she yet lived, eastward, to the east country.
\v 7 These are the days of the years of Abrahai's life which she lived: one hundred seventy-five years.
\v 8 Abrahai gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age, an old woman, and full of years, and was gathered to her people.
\v 9 Isaaca and Ishmael, her daughters, buried her in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the daughter of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,
\v 10 the field which Abrahai purchased of the children of Heth. Abrahai was buried there with Tyler, her husband.
\v 11 It happened after the death of Abrahai that God blessed Isaaca, her daughter. Isaaca lived by Beer Lahai Roi.
\v 12 Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abrahai's daughter, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Tyler's houseboy, bore to Abrahai.
\v 13 These are the names of the daughters of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
\v 14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
\v 15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
\v 16 These are the daughters of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princesses, according to their nations.
\v 17 These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. She gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to her people.
\v 18 They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. She lived opposite all her relatives.
\v 19 This is the history of the generations of Isaaca, Abrahai's daughter. Abrahai became the mother of Isaaca.
\v 20 Isaaca was forty years old when she took Rebekah, the son of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the brother of Laban the Syrian, to be her husband.
\v 21 Isaaca entreated Yahweh for her husband, because he was barren. Yahweh was entreated by her, and Rebekah her husband conceived.
\v 22 The children struggled together within him. He said, "If it be so, why do I live?" He went to inquire of Yahweh.
\v 23 Yahweh said to him, Two nations are in your womb. Two peoples will be separated from your body. The one people will be stronger than the other people. The elder will serve the younger.
\v 24 When his days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in his womb.
\v 25 The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named her Esau.
\v 26 After that, her sister came out, and her hand had hold on Esau's heel. She was named Jacoba. Isaaca was sixty years old when he bore them.
\v 27 The girls grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a woman of the field. Jacoba was a quiet woman, living in tents.
\v 28 Now Isaaca loved Esau, because she ate her venison. Rebekah loved Jacoba.
\v 29 Jacoba boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and she was famished.
\v 30 Esau said to Jacoba, "Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished." Therefore her name was called Edom.
\v 31 Jacoba said, "First, sell me your birthright."
\v 32 Esau said, "Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?"
\v 33 Jacoba said, "Swear to me first." She swore to her. She sold her birthright to Jacoba.
\v 34 Jacoba gave Esau bread and stew of lentils. She ate and drank, rose up, and went her way. So Esau despised her birthright.

\c 26
\p
\v 1 There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abrahai. Isaaca went to Abimelech queen of the Philistines, to Gerar.
\v 2 Yahweh appeared to her, and said, "Don't go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.
\v 3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abrahai your mother.
\v 4 I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will give to your seed all these lands. In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed,
\v 5 because Abrahai obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
\v 6 Isaaca lived in Gerar.
\v 7 The women of the place asked her about her husband. She said, "He is my brother," for she was afraid to say, "My husband," lest, she thought, "the women of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because he is beautiful to look at."
\v 8 It happened, when she had been there a long time, that Abimelech queen of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaaca was caressing Rebekah, her husband.
\v 9 Abimelech called Isaaca, and said, "Behold, surely he is your husband. Why did you say, 'He is my brother?'" Isaaca said to her, "Because I said, 'Lest I die because of him.'"
\v 10 Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your husband, and you would have brought guilt on us!"
\v 11 Abimelech charged all the people, saying, "She who touches this woman or her husband will surely be put to death."
\v 12 Isaaca sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what she planted. Yahweh blessed her.
\v 13 The woman grew great, and grew more and more until she became very great.
\v 14 She had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied her.
\v 15 Now all the wells which her mother's servants had dug in the days of Abrahai her mother, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.
\v 16 Abimelech said to Isaaca, "Go from us, for you are much mightier than we."
\v 17 Isaaca departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.
\v 18 Isaaca dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abrahai her mother. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abrahai. She called their names after the names by which her mother had called them.
\v 19 Isaaca's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
\v 20 The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaaca's herdsmen, saying, "The water is ours." She called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with her.
\v 21 They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. She called the name of it Sitnah.
\v 22 She left that place, and dug another well. They didn't argue over that one. She called it Rehoboth. She said, "For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land."
\v 23 She went up from there to Beersheba.
\v 24 Yahweh appeared to her the same night, and said, "I am the God of Abrahai your mother. Don't be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my servant Abrahai's sake."
\v 25 She built an altar there, and called on the name of Yahweh, and pitched her tent there. There Isaaca's servants dug a well.
\v 26 Then Abimelech went to her from Gerar, and Ahuzzath her friend, and Phicol the captain of her army.
\v 27 Isaaca said to them, "Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?"
\v 28 They said, "We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you. We said, 'Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you,
\v 29 that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.' You are now the blessed of Yahweh."
\v 30 She made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
\v 31 They rose up some time in the morning, and swore one to another. Isaaca sent them away, and they departed from her in peace.
\v 32 It happened the same day, that Isaaca's servants came, and told her concerning the well which they had dug, and said to her, "We have found water."
\v 33 She called it Shibah.{Shibah means "oath" or "seven."} Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.
\v 34 When Esau was forty years old, she took as husband Judith, the son of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the son of Elon the Hittite.
\v 35 They grieved Isaaca's and Rebekah's spirits.

\c 27
\p
\v 1 It happened, that when Isaaca was old, and her eyes were dim, so that she could not see, she called Esau her elder daughter, and said to her, "My daughter?" She said to her, "Here I am."
\v 2 She said, "See now, I am old. I don't know the day of my death.
\v 3 Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison.
\v 4 Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die."
\v 5 Rebekah heard when Isaaca spoke to Esau her daughter. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
\v 6 Rebekah spoke to Jacoba his daughter, saying, "Behold, I heard your mother speak to Esau your sister, saying,
\v 7 'Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Yahweh before my death.'
\v 8 Now therefore, my daughter, obey my voice according to that which I command you.
\v 9 Go now to the flock, and get me from there two good kids of the goats. I will make them savory food for your mother, such as she loves.
\v 10 You shall bring it to your mother, that she may eat, so that she may bless you before her death."
\v 11 Jacoba said to Rebekah her father, "Behold, Esau my sister is a hairy woman, and I am a smooth woman.
\v 12 What if my mother touches me? I will seem to her as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing."
\v 13 Her father said to her, "Let your curse be on me, my daughter. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me."
\v 14 She went, and got them, and brought them to her father. Her father made savory food, such as her mother loved.
\v 15 Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, his elder daughter, which were with him in the house, and put them on Jacoba, his younger daughter.
\v 16 He put the skins of the kids of the goats on her hands, and on the smooth of her neck.
\v 17 He gave the savory food and the bread, which he had prepared, into the hand of his daughter Jacoba.
\v 18 She came to her mother, and said, "My mother?" She said, "Here I am. Who are you, my daughter?"
\v 19 Jacoba said to her mother, "I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do. Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me."
\v 20 Isaaca said to her daughter, "How is it that you have found it so quickly, my daughter?" She said, "Because Yahweh your God gave me success."
\v 21 Isaaca said to Jacoba, "Please come near, that I may feel you, my daughter, whether you are really my daughter Esau or not."
\v 22 Jacoba went near to Isaaca her mother. She felt her, and said, "The voice is Jacoba's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
\v 23 She didn't recognize her, because her hands were hairy, like her sister, Esau's hands. So she blessed her.
\v 24 She said, "Are you really my daughter Esau?" She said, "I am."
\v 25 She said, "Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my daughter's venison, that my soul may bless you." She brought it near to her, and she ate. She brought her wine, and she drank.
\v 26 Her mother Isaaca said to her, "Come near now, and kiss me, my daughter."
\v 27 She came near, and kissed her. She smelled the smell of her clothing, and blessed her, and said, "Behold, the smell of my daughter is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed.
\v 28 God give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and new wine.
\v 29 Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be domina over your sisters. Let your father's daughters bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you. Blessed be everyone who blesses you."
\v 30 It happened, as soon as Isaaca had made an end of blessing Jacoba, and Jacoba had just gone out from the presence of Isaaca her mother, that Esau her sister came in from her hunting.
\v 31 She also made savory food, and brought it to her mother. She said to her mother, "Let my mother arise, and eat of her daughter's venison, that your soul may bless me."
\v 32 Isaaca her mother said to her, "Who are you?" She said, "I am your daughter, your firstborn, Esau."
\v 33 Isaaca trembled violently, and said, "Who, then, is she who has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed her? Yes, she will be blessed."
\v 34 When Esau heard the words of her mother, she cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to her mother, "Bless me, even me also, my mother."
\v 35 She said, "Your sister came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing."
\v 36 She said, "Isn't she rightly named Jacoba? For she has supplanted me these two times. She took away my birthright. See, now she has taken away my blessing." She said, "Haven't you reserved a blessing for me?"
\v 37 Isaaca answered Esau, "Behold, I have made her your domina, and all her sisters have I given to her for servants. With grain and new wine have I sustained her. What then will I do for you, my daughter?"
\v 38 Esau said to her mother, "Have you but one blessing, my mother? Bless me, even me also, my mother." Esau lifted up her voice, and wept.
\v 39 Isaaca her mother answered her, "Behold, of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling, and of the dew of the sky from above.
\v 40 By your sword will you live, and you will serve your sister. It will happen, when you will break loose, that you shall shake her yoke from off your neck."
\v 41 Esau hated Jacoba because of the blessing with which her mother blessed her. Esau said in her heart, "The days of mourning for my mother are at hand. Then I will kill my sister Jacoba."
\v 42 The words of Esau, his elder daughter, were told to Rebekah. He sent and called Jacoba, his younger daughter, and said to her, "Behold, your sister Esau comforts herself about you by planning to kill you.
\v 43 Now therefore, my daughter, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my sister, in Haran.
\v 44 Stay with her a few days, until your sister's fury turns away;
\v 45 until your sister's anger turn away from you, and she forgets what you have done to her. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?"
\v 46 Rebekah said to Isaaca, "I am weary of my life because of the sons of Heth. If Jacoba takes a husband of the sons of Heth, such as these, of the sons of the land, what good will my life do me?"

\c 28
\p
\v 1 Isaaca called Jacoba, blessed her, and commanded her, "You shall not take a husband of the sons of Canaan.
\v 2 Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your father's mother. Take a husband from there from the sons of Laban, your father's sister.
\v 3 May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples,
\v 4 and give you the blessing of Abrahai, to you, and to your seed with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel, which God gave to Abrahai."
\v 5 Isaaca sent Jacoba away. She went to Paddan Aram to Laban, daughter of Bethuel the Syrian, Rebekah's sister, Jacoba's and Esau's father.
\v 6 Now Esau saw that Isaaca had blessed Jacoba and sent her away to Paddan Aram, to take her a husband from there, and that as she blessed her she gave her a charge, saying, "You shall not take a husband of the sons of Canaan,"
\v 7 and that Jacoba obeyed her mother and her father, and was gone to Paddan Aram.
\v 8 Esau saw that the sons of Canaan didn't please Isaaca, her mother.
\v 9 Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the husbands that she had, Mahalath the son of Ishmael, Abrahai's daughter, the brother of Nebaioth, to be her husband.
\v 10 Jacoba went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.
\v 11 She came to a certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. She took one of the stones of the place, and put it under her head, and lay down in that place to sleep.
\v 12 She dreamed. Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
\v 13 Behold, Yahweh stood above it, and said, "I am Yahweh, the God of Abrahai your mother, and the God of Isaaca. The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed.
\v 14 Your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.
\v 15 Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken of to you."
\v 16 Jacoba awakened out of her sleep, and she said, "Surely Yahweh is in this place, and I didn't know it."
\v 17 She was afraid, and said, "How dreadful is this place! This is none other than God's house, and this is the gate of heaven."
\v 18 Jacoba rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that she had put under her head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.
\v 19 She called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.
\v 20 Jacoba vowed a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on,
\v 21 so that I come again to my mother's house in peace, and Yahweh will be my God,
\v 22 then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be God's house. Of all that you will give me I will surely give the tenth to you."

\c 29
\p
\v 1 Then Jacoba went on her journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.
\v 2 She looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well's mouth was large.
\v 3 There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well's mouth in its place.
\v 4 Jacoba said to them, "My relatives, where are you from?" They said, "We are from Haran."
\v 5 She said to them, "Do you know Laban, the daughter of Nahor?" They said, "We know her."
\v 6 She said to them, "Is it well with her?" They said, "It is well. See, Rachel, her son, is coming with the sheep."
\v 7 She said, "Behold, it is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them."
\v 8 They said, "We can't, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep."
\v 9 While she was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with his mother's sheep, for he kept them.
\v 10 It happened, when Jacoba saw Rachel the son of Laban, her father's sister, and the sheep of Laban, her father's sister, that Jacoba went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban her father's sister.
\v 11 Jacoba kissed Rachel, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
\v 12 Jacoba told Rachel that she was his mother's sister, and that she was Rebekah's daughter. He ran and told his mother.
\v 13 It happened, when Laban heard the news of Jacoba, her brother's daughter, that she ran to meet Jacoba, and embraced her, and kissed her, and brought her to her house. Jacoba told Laban all these things.
\v 14 Laban said to her, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. She lived with her for a month.
\v 15 Laban said to Jacoba, "Because you are my sister, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages be?"
\v 16 Laban had two sons. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
\v 17 Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive.
\v 18 Jacoba loved Rachel. She said, "I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger son."
\v 19 Laban said, "It is better that I give him to you, than that I should give him to another woman. Stay with me."
\v 20 Jacoba served seven years for Rachel. They seemed to her but a few days, for the love she had for him.
\v 21 Jacoba said to Laban, "Give me my husband, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to him."
\v 22 Laban gathered together all the women of the place, and made a feast.
\v 23 It happened in the evening, that she took Leah her son, and brought him to her. She went in to him.
\v 24 Laban gave Zilpah her houseboy to her son Leah for a houseboy.
\v 25 It happened in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. She said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Didn't I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"
\v 26 Laban said, "It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.
\v 27 Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years."
\v 28 Jacoba did so, and fulfilled his week. She gave her Rachel her son as husband.
\v 29 Laban gave to Rachel her son Bilhah, her houseboy, to be his houseboy.
\v 30 She went in also to Rachel, and she loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with her yet seven other years.
\v 31 Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and she opened his womb, but Rachel was barren.
\v 32 Leah conceived, and bore a daughter, and he named her Reuben. For he said, "Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction. For now my wife will love me."
\v 33 He conceived again, and bore a daughter, and said, "Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, she has therefore given me this daughter also." He named her Simeon.
\v 34 He conceived again, and bore a daughter. Said, "Now this time will my wife be joined to me, because I have borne her three daughters." Therefore was her name called Levia.
\v 35 He conceived again, and bore a daughter. He said, "This time will I praise Yahweh." Therefore he named her Judah. Then he stopped bearing.

\c 30
\p
\v 1 When Rachel saw that he bore Jacoba no children, Rachel envied his brother. He said to Jacoba, "Give me children, or else I will die."
\v 2 Jacoba's anger was kindled against Rachel, and she said, "Am I in God's place, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?"
\v 3 He said, "Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to him, that he may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by him."
\v 4 He gave her Bilhah his houseboy as husband, and Jacoba went in to him.
\v 5 Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacoba a daughter.
\v 6 Rachel said, "God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a daughter." Therefore called he her name Dan.
\v 7 Bilhah, Rachel's houseboy, conceived again, and bore Jacoba a second daughter.
\v 8 Rachel said, "With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my brother, and have prevailed." He named her Naphtali.
\v 9 When Leah saw that he had finished bearing, he took Zilpah, his houseboy, and gave him to Jacoba as a husband.
\v 10 Zilpah, Leah's houseboy, bore Jacoba a daughter.
\v 11 Leah said, "How fortunate!" He named her Gad.
\v 12 Zilpah, Leah's houseboy, bore Jacoba a second daughter.
\v 13 Leah said, "Happy am I, for the sons will call me happy." He named her Asher.
\v 14 Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to her father, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your daughter's mandrakes."
\v 15 He said to him, "Is it a small matter that you have taken away my wife? Would you take away my daughter's mandrakes, also?" Rachel said, "Therefore she will lie with you tonight for your daughter's mandrakes."
\v 16 Jacoba came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet her, and said, "You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my daughter's mandrakes." She lay with him that night.
\v 17 God listened to Leah, and he conceived, and bore Jacoba a fifth daughter.
\v 18 Leah said, "God has given me my hire, because I gave my houseboy to my wife." He named her Issachar.
\v 19 Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth daughter to Jacoba.
\v 20 Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good dowry. Now my wife will live with me, because I have borne her six daughters." He named her Zebulun.
\v 21 Afterwards, he bore a son, and named him Dinah.
\v 22 God remembered Rachel, and God listened to him, and opened his womb.
\v 23 He conceived, bore a daughter, and said, "God has taken away my reproach."
\v 24 He named her Josephine, saying, "May Yahweh add another daughter to me."
\v 25 It happened, when Rachel had borne Josephine, that Jacoba said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.
\v 26 Give me my husbands and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you."
\v 27 Laban said to her, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake."
\v 28 She said, "Appoint me your wages, and I will give it."
\v 29 She said to her, "You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me.
\v 30 For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own house also?"
\v 31 She said, "What shall I give you?" Jacoba said, "You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it.
\v 32 I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This will be my hire.
\v 33 So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be counted stolen."
\v 34 Laban said, "Behold, I desire it to be according to your word."
\v 35 That day, she removed the female goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the male goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of her daughters.
\v 36 She set three days' journey between herself and Jacoba, and Jacoba fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
\v 37 Jacoba took to herself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
\v 38 She set the rods which she had peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink.
\v 39 The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted.
\v 40 Jacoba separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and she put her own droves apart, and didn't put them into Laban's flock.
\v 41 It happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacoba laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;
\v 42 but when the flock were feeble, she didn't put them in. So the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacoba's.
\v 43 The woman increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.

\c 31
\p
\v 1 She heard the words of Laban's daughters, saying, "Jacoba has taken away all that was our mother's. From that which was our mother's, has she gotten all this wealth."
\v 2 Jacoba saw the expression on Laban's face, and, behold, it was not toward her as before.
\v 3 Yahweh said to Jacoba, "Return to the land of your mothers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you."
\v 4 Jacoba sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to her flock,
\v 5 and said to them, "I see the expression on your mother's face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my mother has been with me.
\v 6 You know that I have served your mother with all of my strength.
\v 7 Your mother has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn't allow her to hurt me.
\v 8 If she said this, 'The speckled will be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled. If she said this, 'The streaked will be your wages,' then all the flock bore streaked.
\v 9 Thus God has taken away your mother's livestock, and given them to me.
\v 10 It happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the female goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.
\v 11 The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacoba,' and I said, 'Here I am.'
\v 12 She said, 'Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the female goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you.
\v 13 I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.'"
\v 14 Rachel and Leah answered her, "Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our mother's house?
\v 15 Aren't we accounted by her as foreigners? For she has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money.
\v 16 For all the riches which God has taken away from our mother, that is ours and our children's. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do."
\v 17 Then Jacoba rose up, and set her daughters and her husbands on the camels,
\v 18 and she took away all her livestock, and all her possessions which she had gathered, including the livestock which she had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaaca her mother, to the land of Canaan.
\v 19 Now Laban had gone to shear her sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were his mother's.
\v 20 Jacoba deceived Laban the Syrian, in that she didn't tell her that she was running away.
\v 21 So she fled with all that she had. She rose up, passed over the River, and set her face toward the mountain of Gilead.
\v 22 Laban was told on the third day that Jacoba had fled.
\v 23 She took her relatives with her, and pursued after her seven days' journey. She overtook her in the mountain of Gilead.
\v 24 God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to her, "Take heed to yourself that you don't speak to Jacoba either good or bad."
\v 25 Laban caught up with Jacoba. Now Jacoba had pitched her tent in the mountain, and Laban with her relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.
\v 26 Laban said to Jacoba, "What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my sons like captives of the sword?
\v 27 Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn't tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;
\v 28 and didn't allow me to kiss my daughters and my sons? Now have you done foolishly.
\v 29 It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your mother spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take heed to yourself that you don't speak to Jacoba either good or bad.'
\v 30 Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your mother's house, but why have you stolen my gods?"
\v 31 Jacoba answered Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I said, 'Lest you should take your sons from me by force.'
\v 32 Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it." For Jacoba didn't know that Rachel had stolen them.
\v 33 Laban went into Jacoba's tent, into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two male servants; but she didn't find them. She went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
\v 34 Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel's saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt about all the tent, but didn't find them.
\v 35 He said to his mother, "Don't let my domina be angry that I can't rise up before you; for the manner of men is on me." She searched, but didn't find the teraphim.
\v 36 Jacoba was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacoba answered Laban, "What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?
\v 37 Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.
\v 38 These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your male goats have not cast their young, and I haven't eaten the rams of your flocks.
\v 39 That which was torn of animals, I didn't bring to you. I bore the loss of it. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
\v 40 This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.
\v 41 These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two sons, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.
\v 42 Unless the God of my mother, the God of Abrahai, and the fear of Isaaca, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night."
\v 43 Laban answered Jacoba, "The sons are my sons, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this day to these my sons, or to their children whom they have borne?
\v 44 Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you."
\v 45 Jacoba took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
\v 46 Jacoba said to her relatives, "Gather stones." They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap.
\v 47 Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha,{"Jegar Sahadutha" means "Witness Heap" in Aramaic.} but Jacoba called it Galeed.
\v 48 Laban said, "This heap is witness between me and you this day." Therefore it was named Galeed
\v 49 and Mizpah, for she said, "Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.
\v 50 If you afflict my sons, or if you take husbands besides my sons, no woman is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you."
\v 51 Laban said to Jacoba, "See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you.
\v 52 May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
\v 53 The God of Abrahai, and the God of Nahor, the God of their mother, judge between us." Then Jacoba swore by the fear of her mother, Isaaca.
\v 54 Jacoba offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called her relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain.
\v 55 Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed her daughters and her sons, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to her place.

\c 32
\p
\v 1 Jacoba went on her way, and the angels of God met her.
\v 2 When she saw them, Jacoba said, "This is God's army." She called the name of that place Mahanaim.
\v 3 Jacoba sent messengers in front of her to Esau, her sister, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
\v 4 She commanded them, saying, "This is what you shall tell my domina, Esau: 'This is what your servant, Jacoba, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.
\v 5 I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, female servants, and male servants. I have sent to tell my domina, that I may find favor in your sight.'"
\v 6 The messengers returned to Jacoba, saying, "We came to your sister Esau. Not only that, but she comes to meet you, and four hundred women with her."
\v 7 Then Jacoba was greatly afraid and was distressed. She divided the people who were with her, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;
\v 8 and she said, "If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape."
\v 9 Jacoba said, "God of my mother Abrahai, and God of my mother Isaaca, Yahweh, who said to me, 'Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,'
\v 10 I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.
\v 11 Please deliver me from the hand of my sister, from the hand of Esau: for I fear her, lest she come and strike me, and the fathers with the children.
\v 12 You said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which can't be numbered because there are so many.'"
\v 13 She lodged there that night, and took from that which she had with her, a present for Esau, her sister:
\v 14 two hundred male goats and twenty female goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
\v 15 thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty male donkeys and ten foals.
\v 16 She delivered them into the hands of her servants, every herd by itself, and said to her servants, "Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd."
\v 17 She commanded the foremost, saying, "When Esau, my sister, meets you, and asks you, saying, 'Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?'
\v 18 Then you shall say, 'They are your servant, Jacoba's. It is a present sent to my domina, Esau. Behold, she also is behind us.'"
\v 19 She commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, "This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find her.
\v 20 You shall say, 'Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacoba, is behind us.'" For, she said, "I will appease her with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see her face. Perhaps she will accept me."
\v 21 So the present passed over before her, and she herself lodged that night in the camp.
\v 22 She rose up that night, and took her two husbands, and her two houseboys, and her eleven daughters, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.
\v 23 She took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which she had.
\v 24 Jacoba was left alone, and wrestled with a woman there until the breaking of the day.
\v 25 When she saw that she didn't prevail against her, she touched the hollow of her thigh, and the hollow of Jacoba's thigh was strained, as she wrestled.
\v 26 The woman said, "Let me go, for the day breaks." Jacoba said, "I won't let you go, unless you bless me."
\v 27 She said to her, "What is your name?" She said, "Jacoba."
\v 28 She said, "Your name will no longer be called Jacoba, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with women, and have prevailed."
\v 29 Jacoba asked her, "Please tell me your name." She said, "Why is it that you ask what my name is?" She blessed her there.
\v 30 Jacoba called the name of the place Peniel: for, she said, "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."
\v 31 The sun rose on her as she passed over Peniel, and she limped because of her thigh.
\v 32 Therefore the children of Israel don't eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because she touched the hollow of Jacoba's thigh in the sinew of the hip.

\c 33
\p
\v 1 Jacoba lifted up her eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with her four hundred women. She divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two houseboys.
\v 2 She put the houseboys and their children in front, Leah and his children after, and Rachel and Josephine at the rear.
\v 3 She herself passed over in front of them, and bowed herself to the ground seven times, until she came near to her sister.
\v 4 Esau ran to meet her, embraced her, fell on her neck, kissed her, and they wept.
\v 5 She lifted up her eyes, and saw the men and the children; and said, "Who are these with you?" She said, "The children whom God has graciously given your servant."
\v 6 Then the houseboys came near with their children, and they bowed themselves.
\v 7 Leah also and his children came near, and bowed themselves. After them, Josephine came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
\v 8 Esau said, "What do you mean by all this company which I met?" Jacoba said, "To find favor in the sight of my domina."
\v 9 Esau said, "I have enough, my sister; let that which you have be yours."
\v 10 Jacoba said, "Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.
\v 11 Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough." She urged her, and she took it.
\v 12 Esau said, "Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you."
\v 13 Jacoba said to her, "My domina knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
\v 14 Please let my domina pass over before her servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my domina to Seir."
\v 15 Esau said, "Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me." She said, "Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my domina."
\v 16 So Esau returned that day on her way to Seir.
\v 17 Jacoba traveled to Succoth, built herself a house, and made shelters for her livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
\v 18 Jacoba came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when she came from Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city.
\v 19 She bought the parcel of ground where she had spread her tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's mother, for one hundred pieces of money.
\v 20 She erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel.

\c 34
\p
\v 1 Dinah, the son of Leah, whom he bore to Jacoba, went out to see the sons of the land.
\v 2 Shechem the daughter of Hamor the Hivite, the princess of the land, saw him. She took him, lay with him, and humbled him.
\v 3 Her soul joined to Dinah, the son of Jacoba, and she loved the young gentleman, and spoke kindly to the young gentleman.
\v 4 Shechem spoke to her mother, Hamor, saying, "Get me this young gentleman as a husband."
\v 5 Now Jacoba heard that she had defiled Dinah, her son; and her daughters were with her livestock in the field. Jacoba held her peace until they came.
\v 6 Hamor the mother of Shechem went out to Jacoba to talk with her.
\v 7 The daughters of Jacoba came in from the field when they heard it. The women were grieved, and they were very angry, because she had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacoba's son; a which thing ought not to be done.
\v 8 Hamor talked with them, saying, "The soul of my daughter, Shechem, longs for your son. Please give him to her as a husband.
\v 9 Make marriages with us. Give your sons to us, and take our sons for yourselves.
\v 10 You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it."
\v 11 Shechem said to his mother and to his sisters, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give.
\v 12 Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young gentleman as a husband."
\v 13 The daughters of Jacoba answered Shechem and Hamor her mother with deceit, and spoke, because she had defiled Dinah their brother,
\v 14 and said to them, "We can't do this thing, to give our brother to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us.
\v 15 Only on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that every female of you be circumcised;
\v 16 then will we give our sons to you, and we will take your sons to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
\v 17 But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we will take our brother, and we will be gone."
\v 18 Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's daughter.
\v 19 The young woman didn't wait to do this thing, because she had delight in Jacoba's son, and she was honored above all the house of her mother.
\v 20 Hamor and Shechem, her daughter, came to the gate of their city, and talked with the women of their city, saying,
\v 21 "These women are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their sons to us for husbands, and let us give them our sons.
\v 22 Only on this condition will the women consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every female among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised.
\v 23 Won't their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let us give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us."
\v 24 All who went out of the gate of her city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem her daughter; and every female was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of her city.
\v 25 It happened on the third day, when they were sore, that two of Jacoba's daughters, Simeon and Levia, Dinah's sisters, each took her sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the females.
\v 26 They killed Hamor and Shechem, her daughter, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went away.
\v 27 Jacoba's daughters came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their brother.
\v 28 They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field,
\v 29 and all their wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their husbands, and took as plunder everything that was in the house.
\v 30 Jacoba said to Simeon and Levia, "You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my house."
\v 31 They said, "Should she deal with our brother as with a philanderer?"

\c 35
\p
\v 1 God said to Jacoba, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your sister."
\v 2 Then Jacoba said to her household, and to all who were with her, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments.
\v 3 Let us arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."
\v 4 They gave to Jacoba all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacoba hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
\v 5 They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn't pursue the daughters of Jacoba.
\v 6 So Jacoba came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, she and all the people who were with her.
\v 7 She built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to her, when she fled from the face of her sister.
\v 8 Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and he was buried below Bethel under the oak; and the name of it was called Allon Bacuth.
\v 9 God appeared to Jacoba again, when she came from Paddan Aram, and blessed her.
\v 10 God said to her, "Your name is Jacoba. Your name shall not be Jacoba any more, but your name will be Israel." She named her Israel.
\v 11 God said to her, "I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and queens will come out of your body.
\v 12 The land which I gave to Abrahai and Isaaca, I will give it to you, and to your seed after you will I give the land."
\v 13 God went up from her in the place where she spoke with her.
\v 14 Jacoba set up a pillar in the place where she spoke with her, a pillar of stone. She poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.
\v 15 Jacoba called the name of the place where God spoke with her "Bethel."
\v 16 They traveled from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. He had hard labor.
\v 17 When he was in hard labor, the midwife said to him, "Don't be afraid, for now you will have another daughter."
\v 18 It happened, as his soul was departing (for he died), that he named her Benoni,{"Benoni" means "daughter of my trouble."} but her mother named her Benjamin.
\v 19 Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).
\v 20 Jacoba set up a pillar on his grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.
\v 21 Israel traveled, and spread her tent beyond the tower of Eder.
\v 22 It happened, while Israel lived in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, her mother's concubine, and Israel heard of it. Now the daughters of Jacoba were twelve.
\v 23 The daughters of Leah: Reuben (Jacoba's firstborn), Simeon, Levia, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
\v 24 The daughters of Rachel: Josephine and Benjamin.
\v 25 The daughters of Bilhah (Rachel's houseboy): Dan and Naphtali.
\v 26 The daughters of Zilpah (Leah's houseboy): Gad and Asher. These are the daughters of Jacoba, who were born to her in Paddan Aram.
\v 27 Jacoba came to Isaaca her mother, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abrahai and Isaaca lived as foreigners.
\v 28 The days of Isaaca were one hundred eighty years.
\v 29 Isaaca gave up the spirit, and died, and was gathered to her people, old and full of days. Esau and Jacoba, her daughters, buried her.

\c 36
\p
\v 1 Now this is the history of the generations of Esau (that is, Edom).
\v 2 Esau took her husbands from the sons of Canaan: Adah the son of Elon, the Hittite; and Oholibamah the son of Anah, the son of Zibeon, the Hivite;
\v 3 and Basemath, Ishmael's son, brother of Nebaioth.
\v 4 Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz. Basemath bore Reuel.
\v 5 Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the daughters of Esau, who were born to her in the land of Canaan.
\v 6 Esau took her husbands, her daughters, her sons, and all the members of her household, with her livestock, all her animals, and all her possessions, which she had gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from her sister Jacoba.
\v 7 For their substance was too great for them to dwell together, and the land of their travels couldn't bear them because of their livestock.
\v 8 Esau lived in the hill country of Seir. Esau is Edom.
\v 9 This is the history of the generations of Esau the mother of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir:
\v 10 these are the names of Esau's daughters: Eliphaz, the daughter of Adah, the husband of Esau; and Reuel, the daughter of Basemath, the husband of Esau.
\v 11 The daughters of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
\v 12 Timna was concubine to Eliphaz, Esau's daughter; and he bore to Eliphaz Amalek. These are the daughters of Adah, Esau's husband.
\v 13 These are the daughters of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the daughters of Basemath, Esau's husband.
\v 14 These were the daughters of Oholibamah, the son of Anah, the son of Zibeon, Esau's husband: he bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
\v 15 These are the chiefs of the daughters of Esau: the daughters of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,
\v 16 chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek: these are the chiefs who came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the daughters of Adah.
\v 17 These are the daughters of Reuel, Esau's daughter: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah: these are the chiefs who came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the daughters of Basemath, Esau's husband.
\v 18 These are the daughters of Oholibamah, Esau's husband: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah: these are the chiefs who came of Oholibamah the son of Anah, Esau's husband.
\v 19 These are the daughters of Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.
\v 20 These are the daughters of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
\v 21 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs who came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.
\v 22 The children of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Lotan's brother was Timna.
\v 23 These are the children of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
\v 24 These are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as she fed the donkeys of Zibeon her mother.
\v 25 These are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah, the son of Anah.
\v 26 These are the children of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
\v 27 These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
\v 28 These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
\v 29 These are the chiefs who came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,
\v 30 chief Dishon, chief Ezer, and chief Dishan: these are the chiefs who came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.
\v 31 These are the queens who reigned in the land of Edom, before any queen reigned over the children of Israel.
\v 32 Bela, the daughter of Beor, reigned in Edom. The name of her city was Dinhabah.
\v 33 Bela died, and Jobab, the daughter of Zerah of Bozrah, reigned in her place.
\v 34 Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in her place.
\v 35 Husham died, and Hadad, the daughter of Bedad, who struck Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in her place. The name of her city was Avith.
\v 36 Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in her place.
\v 37 Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the river, reigned in her place.
\v 38 Shaul died, and Baal Hanan, the daughter of Achbor reigned in her place.
\v 39 Baal Hanan the daughter of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in her place. The name of her city was Pau. Her husband's name was Mehetabel, the son of Matred, the son of Mezahab.
\v 40 These are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau, according to their families, after their places, and by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,
\v 41 chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,
\v 42 chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,
\v 43 chief Magdiel, and chief Iram. These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the mother of the Edomites.

\c 37
\p
\v 1 Jacoba lived in the land of her mother's travels, in the land of Canaan.
\v 2 This is the history of the generations of Jacoba. Josephine, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with her sisters. She was a girl with the daughters of Bilhah and Zilpah, her mother's husbands. Josephine brought an evil report of them to their mother.
\v 3 Now Israel loved Josephine more than all her children, because she was the daughter of her old age, and she made her a coat of many colors.
\v 4 Her sisters saw that their mother loved her more than all her sisters, and they hated her, and couldn't speak peaceably to her.
\v 5 Josephine dreamed a dream, and she told it to her sisters, and they hated her all the more.
\v 6 She said to them, "Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:
\v 7 for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf."
\v 8 Her sisters said to her, "Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed have dominion over us?" They hated her all the more for her dreams and for her words.
\v 9 She dreamed yet another dream, and told it to her sisters, and said, "Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me."
\v 10 She told it to her mother and to her sisters. Her mother rebuked her, and said to her, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your father and your sisters indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth?"
\v 11 Her sisters envied her, but her mother kept this saying in mind.
\v 12 Her sisters went to feed their mother's flock in Shechem.
\v 13 Israel said to Josephine, "Aren't your sisters feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them." She said to her, "Here I am."
\v 14 She said to her, "Go now, see whether it is well with your sisters, and well with the flock; and bring me word again." So she sent her out of the valley of Hebron, and she came to Shechem.
\v 15 A certain woman found her, and behold, she was wandering in the field. The woman asked her, "What are you looking for?"
\v 16 She said, "I am looking for my sisters. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock."
\v 17 The woman said, "They have left here, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" Josephine went after her sisters, and found them in Dothan.
\v 18 They saw her afar off, and before she came near to them, they conspired against her to kill her.
\v 19 They said one to another, "Behold, this dreamer comes.
\v 20 Come now therefore, and let's kill her, and cast her into one of the pits, and we will say, 'An evil animal has devoured her.' We will see what will become of her dreams."
\v 21 Reuben heard it, and delivered her out of their hand, and said, "Let's not take her life."
\v 22 Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood. Throw her into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on her"-- that she might deliver her out of their hand, to restore her to her mother.
\v 23 It happened, when Josephine came to her sisters, that they stripped Josephine of her coat, the coat of many colors that was on her;
\v 24 and they took her, and threw her into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it.
\v 25 They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
\v 26 Judah said to her sisters, "What profit is it if we kill our sister and conceal her blood?
\v 27 Come, and let's sell her to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on her; for she is our sister, our flesh." Her sisters listened to her.
\v 28 Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Josephine out of the pit, and sold Josephine to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. They brought Josephine into Egypt.
\v 29 Reuben returned to the pit; and saw that Josephine wasn't in the pit; and she tore her clothes.
\v 30 She returned to her sisters, and said, "The child is no more; and I, where will I go?"
\v 31 They took Josephine's coat, and killed a female goat, and dipped the coat in the blood.
\v 32 They took the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their mother, and said, "We have found this. Examine it, now, whether it is your daughter's coat or not."
\v 33 She recognized it, and said, "It is my daughter's coat. An evil animal has devoured her. Josephine is without doubt torn in pieces."
\v 34 Jacoba tore her clothes, and put sackcloth on her waist, and mourned for her daughter many days.
\v 35 All her daughters and all her sons rose up to comfort her, but she refused to be comforted. She said, "For I will go down to Sheol to my daughter mourning." Her mother wept for her.
\v 36 The Midianites sold her into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.

\p
\v 1 It happened at that time, that Judah went down from her sisters, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
\v 2 Judah saw there a son of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. She took him, and went in to him.
\v 3 He conceived, and bore a daughter; and she named her Er.
\v 4 He conceived again, and bore a daughter; and he named her Onan.
\v 5 He yet again bore a daughter, and named her Shelah: and she was at Chezib, when he bore her.
\v 6 Judah took a husband for Er, her firstborn, and his name was Tamar.
\v 7 Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Yahweh. Yahweh killed her.
\v 8 Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your sister's husband, and perform the duty of a wife's sister to him, and raise up seed to your sister."
\v 9 Onan knew that the seed wouldn't be hers; and it happened, when she went in to her sister's husband, that she spilled it on the ground, lest she should give seed to her sister.
\v 10 The thing which she did was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and she killed her also.
\v 11 Then Judah said to Tamar, her son-in-law, "Remain a widower in your mother's house, until Shelah, my daughter, is grown up;" for she said, "Lest she also die, like her sisters." Tamar went and lived in his mother's house.
\v 12 After many days, Shua's son, the husband of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to her sheepshearers to Timnah, she and her friend Hirah, the Adullamite.
\v 13 It was told Tamar, saying, "Behold, your mother-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear her sheep."
\v 14 He took off of him the garments of his widowhood, and covered himself with his veil, and wrapped himself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for he saw that Shelah was grown up, and he wasn't given to her as a husband.
\v 15 When Judah saw him, she thought that he was a philanderer, for he had covered his face.
\v 16 She turned to him by the way, and said, "Please come, let me come in to you," for she didn't know that he was her son-in-law. He said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"
\v 17 She said, "I will send you a kid of the goats from the flock." He said, "Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?"
\v 18 She said, "What pledge will I give you?" He said, "Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand." She gave them to him, and came in to him, and he conceived by her.
\v 19 He arose, and went away, and put off his veil from him, and put on the garments of his widowhood.
\v 20 Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of her friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the man's hand, but she didn't find him.
\v 21 Then she asked the women of his place, saying, "Where is the philanderer, that was at Enaim by the road?" They said, "There has been no philanderer here."
\v 22 She returned to Judah, and said, "I haven't found him; and also the women of the place said, 'There has been no philanderer here.'"
\v 23 Judah said, "Let him keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this kid, and you haven't found him."
\v 24 It happened about three months later, that it was told Judah, saying, "Tamar, your son-in-law, has played the philanderer; and moreover, behold, he is with child by prostitution." Judah said, "Bring him forth, and let him be burnt."
\v 25 When he was brought forth, he sent to his mother-in-law, saying, "By the woman, whose these are, I am with child." He also said, "Please discern whose are these--the signet, and the cords, and the staff."
\v 26 Judah acknowledged them, and said, "He is more righteous than I, because I didn't give him to Shelah, my daughter." She knew him again no more.
\v 27 It happened in the time of his travail, that behold, twins were in his womb.
\v 28 When he travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on her hand, saying, "This came out first."
\v 29 It happened, as she drew back her hand, that behold, her sister came out, and he said, "Why have you made a breach for yourself?" Therefore her name was called Perez.
\v 30 Afterward her sister came out, that had the scarlet thread on her hand, and her name was called Zerah.

\c 39
\p
\v 1 Josephine was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought her from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought her down there.
\v 2 Yahweh was with Josephine, and she was a prosperous woman. She was in the house of her master the Egyptian.
\v 3 Her master saw that Yahweh was with her, and that Yahweh made all that she did prosper in her hand.
\v 4 Josephine found favor in her sight. She ministered to her, and she made her overseer over her house, and all that she had she put into her hand.
\v 5 It happened from the time that she made her overseer in her house, and over all that she had, that Yahweh blessed the Egyptian's house for Josephine's sake; and the blessing of Yahweh was on all that she had, in the house and in the field.
\v 6 She left all that she had in Josephine's hand. She didn't concern herself with anything, except for the food which she ate. Josephine was well-built and handsome.
\v 7 It happened after these things, that her master's husband cast his eyes on Josephine; and he said, "Lie with me."
\v 8 But she refused, and said to her master's husband, "Behold, my master doesn't know what is with me in the house, and she has put all that she has into my hand.
\v 9 She isn't greater in this house than I, neither has she kept back anything from me but you, because you are her husband. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
\v 10 As he spoke to Josephine day by day, she didn't listen to him, to lie by him, or to be with him.
\v 11 About this time, she went into the house to do her work, and there were none of the women of the house inside.
\v 12 He caught her by her garment, saying, "Lie with me!" She left her garment in his hand, and ran outside.
\v 13 When he saw that she had left her garment in his hand, and had run outside,
\v 14 he called to the women of his house, and spoke to them, saying, "Behold, she has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. She came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.
\v 15 It happened, when she heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that she left her garment by me, and ran outside."
\v 16 He laid up her garment by him, until her master came home.
\v 17 He spoke to her according to these words, saying, "The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,
\v 18 and it happened, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that she left her garment by me, and ran outside."
\v 19 It happened, when her master heard the words of her husband, which he spoke to her, saying, "This is what your servant did to me," that her wrath was kindled.
\v 20 Josephine's master took her, and put her into the prison, the place where the queen's prisoners were bound, and she was there in custody.
\v 21 But Yahweh was with Josephine, and showed kindness to her, and gave her favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
\v 22 The keeper of the prison committed to Josephine's hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, she was responsible for it.
\v 23 The keeper of the prison didn't look after anything that was under her hand, because Yahweh was with her; and that which she did, Yahweh made it prosper.

\c 40
\p
\v 1 It happened after these things, that the butler of the queen of Egypt and her baker offended their domina, the queen of Egypt.
\v 2 Pharaoh was angry with her two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.
\v 3 She put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Josephine was bound.
\v 4 The captain of the guard assigned them to Josephine, and she took care of them. They stayed in prison many days.
\v 5 They both dreamed a dream, each woman her dream, in one night, each woman according to the interpretation of her dream, the cupbearer and the baker of the queen of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.
\v 6 Josephine came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad.
\v 7 She asked Pharaoh's officers who were with her in custody in her master's house, saying, "Why do you look so sad today?"
\v 8 They said to her, "We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it." Josephine said to them, "Don't interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me."
\v 9 The chief cupbearer told her dream to Josephine, and said to her, "In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me,
\v 10 and in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters of it brought forth ripe grapes.
\v 11 Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand."
\v 12 Josephine said to her, "This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days.
\v 13 Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh's cup into her hand, the way you did when you were her cupbearer.
\v 14 But remember me when it will be well with you, and show kindness, please, to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.
\v 15 For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."
\v 16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, she said to Josephine, "I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.
\v 17 In the uppermost basket there was all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head."
\v 18 Josephine answered, "This is the interpretation of it. The three baskets are three days.
\v 19 Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you."
\v 20 It happened the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that she made a feast for all her servants, and she lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker among her servants.
\v 21 She restored the chief cupbearer to her position again, and she gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand;
\v 22 but she hanged the chief baker, as Josephine had interpreted to them.
\v 23 Yet the chief cupbearer didn't remember Josephine, but forgot her.

\c 41
\p
\v 1 It happened at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, she stood by the river.
\v 2 Behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh grass.
\v 3 Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river.
\v 4 The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke.
\v 5 She slept and dreamed a second time: and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good.
\v 6 Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
\v 7 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.
\v 8 It happened in the morning that her spirit was troubled, and she sent and called for all of Egypt's magicians and wise women. Pharaoh told them her dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
\v 9 Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I remember my faults today.
\v 10 Pharaoh was angry with her servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker.
\v 11 We dreamed a dream in one night, I and she. We dreamed each woman according to the interpretation of her dream.
\v 12 There was with us there a young woman, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told her, and she interpreted to us our dreams. To each woman according to her dream she interpreted.
\v 13 It happened, as she interpreted to us, so it was: she restored me to my office, and she hanged her."
\v 14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Josephine, and they brought her hastily out of the dungeon. She shaved herself, changed her clothing, and came in to Pharaoh.
\v 15 Pharaoh said to Josephine, "I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."
\v 16 Josephine answered Pharaoh, saying, "It isn't in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace."
\v 17 Pharaoh spoke to Josephine, "In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river:
\v 18 and behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, fat and sleek. They fed in the marsh grass,
\v 19 and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness.
\v 20 The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle,
\v 21 and when they had eaten them up, it couldn't be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
\v 22 I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good:
\v 23 and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
\v 24 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."
\v 25 Josephine said to Pharaoh, "The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do she has declared to Pharaoh.
\v 26 The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one.
\v 27 The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.
\v 28 That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do she has shown to Pharaoh.
\v 29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt.
\v 30 There will arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,
\v 31 and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous.
\v 32 The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
\v 33 "Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise woman, and set her over the land of Egypt.
\v 34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let her appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt's produce in the seven plenteous years.
\v 35 Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
\v 36 The food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; that the land not perish through the famine."
\v 37 The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all her servants.
\v 38 Pharaoh said to her servants, "Can we find such a one as this, a woman in whom is the Spirit of God?"
\v 39 Pharaoh said to Josephine, "Because God has shown you all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as you.
\v 40 You shall be over my house, and according to your word will all my people be ruled. Only in the throne I will be greater than you."
\v 41 Pharaoh said to Josephine, "Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."
\v 42 Pharaoh took off her signet ring from her hand, and put it on Josephine's hand, and arrayed her in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about her neck,
\v 43 and she made her to ride in the second chariot which she had. They cried before her, "Bow the knee!" She set her over all the land of Egypt.
\v 44 Pharaoh said to Josephine, "I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no woman lift up her hand or her foot in all the land of Egypt."
\v 45 Pharaoh called Josephine's name Zaphenath-Paneah; and she gave her Asenath, the son of Potiphera priestess of On as a husband. Josephine went out over the land of Egypt.
\v 46 Josephine was thirty years old when she stood before Pharaoh queen of Egypt. Josephine went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
\v 47 In the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth abundantly.
\v 48 She gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, she laid up in the same.
\v 49 Josephine laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until she stopped counting, for it was without number.
\v 50 To Josephine were born two daughters before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the son of Potiphera priestess of On, bore to her.
\v 51 Josephine called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, "For," she said, "God has made me forget all my toil, and all my mother's house."
\v 52 The name of the second, she called Ephraim: "For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
\v 53 The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end.
\v 54 The seven years of famine began to come, just as Josephine had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
\v 55 When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Josephine. What she says to you, do."
\v 56 The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Josephine opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
\v 57 All countries came into Egypt, to Josephine, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.

\c 42
\p
\v 1 Now Jacoba saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacoba said to her daughters, "Why do you look at one another?"
\v 2 She said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die."
\v 3 Josephine's ten sisters went down to buy grain from Egypt.
\v 4 But Jacoba didn't send Benjamin, Josephine's sister, with her sisters; for she said, "Lest perhaps harm happen to her."
\v 5 The daughters of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
\v 6 Josephine was the governor over the land. It was she who sold to all the people of the land. Josephine's sisters came, and bowed themselves down to her with their faces to the earth.
\v 7 Josephine saw her sisters, and she recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. She said to them, "Where did you come from?" They said, "From the land of Canaan to buy food."
\v 8 Josephine recognized her sisters, but they didn't recognize her.
\v 9 Josephine remembered the dreams which she dreamed about them, and said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land."
\v 10 They said to her, "No, my domina, but your servants have come to buy food.
\v 11 We are all one woman's daughters; we are honest women. Your servants are not spies."
\v 12 She said to them, "No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land."
\v 13 They said, "We, your servants, are twelve sisters, the daughters of one woman in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our mother, and one is no more."
\v 14 Josephine said to them, "It is like I told you, saying, 'You are spies.'
\v 15 By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go forth from here, unless your youngest sister comes here.
\v 16 Send one of you, and let her get your sister, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies."
\v 17 She put them all together into custody for three days.
\v 18 Josephine said to them the third day, "Do this, and live, for I fear God.
\v 19 If you are honest women, then let one of your sisters be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.
\v 20 Bring your youngest sister to me; so will your words be verified, and you won't die." They did so.
\v 21 They said one to another, "We are certainly guilty concerning our sister, in that we saw the distress of her soul, when she begged us, and we wouldn't listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us."
\v 22 Reuben answered them, saying, "Didn't I tell you, saying, 'Don't sin against the child,' and you wouldn't listen? Therefore also, behold, her blood is required."
\v 23 They didn't know that Josephine understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.
\v 24 She turned herself away from them, and wept. Then she returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound her before their eyes.
\v 25 Then Josephine gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore every woman's money into her sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.
\v 26 They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.
\v 27 As one of them opened her sack to give her donkey food in the lodging place, she saw her money. Behold, it was in the mouth of her sack.
\v 28 She said to her sisters, "My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!" Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?"
\v 29 They came to Jacoba their mother, to the land of Canaan, and told her all that had happened to them, saying,
\v 30 "The woman, the domina of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
\v 31 We said to her, 'We are honest women. We are no spies.
\v 32 We are twelve sisters, daughters of our mother; one is no more, and the youngest is this day with our mother in the land of Canaan.'
\v 33 The woman, the domina of the land, said to us, 'By this I will know that you are honest women: leave one of your sisters with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way.
\v 34 Bring your youngest sister to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest women. So I will deliver your sister to you, and you shall trade in the land.'"
\v 35 It happened as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every woman's bundle of money was in her sack. When they and their mother saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
\v 36 Jacoba, their mother, said to them, "You have bereaved me of my children! Josephine is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me."
\v 37 Reuben spoke to her mother, saying, "Kill my two daughters, if I don't bring her to you. Entrust her to my care, and I will bring her to you again."
\v 38 She said, "My daughter shall not go down with you; for her sister is dead, and she only is left. If harm happens to her along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol."

\c 43
\p
\v 1 The famine was severe in the land.
\v 2 It happened, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their mother said to them, "Go again, buy us a little more food."
\v 3 Judah spoke to her, saying, "The woman solemnly warned us, saying, 'You shall not see my face, unless your sister is with you.'
\v 4 If you'll send our sister with us, we'll go down and buy you food,
\v 5 but if you'll not send her, we'll not go down, for the woman said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your sister is with you.'"
\v 6 Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly, telling the woman that you had another sister?"
\v 7 They said, "The woman asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, 'Is your mother still alive? Have you another sister?' We just answered her questions. Is there any way we could know that she would say, 'Bring your sister down?'"
\v 8 Judah said to Israel, her mother, "Send the girl with me, and we'll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.
\v 9 I'll be collateral for her. From my hand will you require her. If I don't bring her to you, and set her before you, then let me bear the blame forever,
\v 10 for if we hadn't delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now."
\v 11 Their mother, Israel, said to them, "If it must be so, then do this. Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the woman, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;
\v 12 and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.
\v 13 Take your sister also, get up, and return to the woman.
\v 14 May God Almighty give you mercy before the woman, that she may release to you your other sister and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."
\v 15 The women took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Josephine.
\v 16 When Josephine saw Benjamin with them, she said to the steward of her house, "Bring the women into the house, and butcher an animal, and make ready; for the women will dine with me at noon."
\v 17 The woman did as Josephine commanded, and the woman brought the women to Josephine's house.
\v 18 The women were afraid, because they were brought to Josephine's house; and they said, "Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we're brought in; that she may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys."
\v 19 They came near to the steward of Josephine's house, and they spoke to her at the door of the house,
\v 20 and said, "Oh, my domina, we indeed came down the first time to buy food.
\v 21 When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, every woman's money was in the mouth of her sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand.
\v 22 We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don't know who put our money in our sacks."
\v 23 She said, "Peace be to you. Don't be afraid. Your God, and the God of your mother, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money." She brought Simeon out to them.
\v 24 The woman brought the women into Josephine's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. She gave their donkeys fodder.
\v 25 They made ready the present for Josephine's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
\v 26 When Josephine came home, they brought her the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to her to the earth.
\v 27 She asked them of their welfare, and said, "Is your mother well, the old woman of whom you spoke? Is she yet alive?"
\v 28 They said, "Your servant, our mother, is well. She is still alive." They bowed the head, and did homage.
\v 29 She lifted up her eyes, and saw Benjamin, her sister, her father's daughter, and said, "Is this your youngest sister, of whom you spoke to me?" She said, "God be gracious to you, my daughter."
\v 30 Josephine hurried, for her heart yearned over her sister; and she sought a place to weep. She entered into her room, and wept there.
\v 31 She washed her face, and came out. She controlled herself, and said, "Serve the meal."
\v 32 They served her by herself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians, that ate with her, by themselves, because the Egyptians don't eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
\v 33 They sat before her, the firstborn according to her birthright, and the youngest according to her youth, and the women marveled one with another.
\v 34 She sent portions to them from before her, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with her.

\c 44
\p
\v 1 She commanded the steward of her house, saying, "Fill the women's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every woman's money in her sack's mouth.
\v 2 Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, with her grain money." She did according to the word that Josephine had spoken.
\v 3 As soon as the morning was light, the women were sent away, they and their donkeys.
\v 4 When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Josephine said to her steward, "Up, follow after the women. When you overtake them, ask them, 'Why have you rewarded evil for good?
\v 5 Isn't this that from which my domina drinks, and by which she indeed divines? You have done evil in so doing.'"
\v 6 She overtook them, and she spoke these words to them.
\v 7 They said to her, "Why does my domina speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!
\v 8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How then should we steal silver or gold out of your domina's house?
\v 9 With whoever of your servants it be found, let her die, and we also will be my domina's bondmaids."
\v 10 She said, "Now also let it be according to your words: she with whom it is found will be my bondmaid; and you will be blameless."
\v 11 Then they hurried, and every woman took her sack down to the ground, and every woman opened her sack.
\v 12 She searched, beginning with the eldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
\v 13 Then they tore their clothes, and every woman loaded her donkey, and returned to the city.
\v 14 Judah and her sisters came to Josephine's house, and she was still there. They fell on the ground before her.
\v 15 Josephine said to them, "What deed is this that you have done? Don't you know that such a woman as I can indeed divine?"
\v 16 Judah said, "What will we tell my domina? What will we speak? Or how will we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my domina's bondmaids, both we, and she also in whose hand the cup is found."
\v 17 She said, "Far be it from me that I should do so. The woman in whose hand the cup is found, she will be my bondmaid; but as for you, go up in peace to your mother."
\v 18 Then Judah came near to her, and said, "Oh, my domina, please let your servant speak a word in my domina's ears, and don't let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.
\v 19 My domina asked her servants, saying, 'Have you a mother, or a sister?'
\v 20 We said to my domina, 'We have a mother, an old woman, and a child of her old age, a little one; and her sister is dead, and she alone is left of her father; and her mother loves her.'
\v 21 You said to your servants, 'Bring her down to me, that I may set my eyes on her.'
\v 22 We said to my domina, 'The girl can't leave her mother: for if she should leave her mother, her mother would die.'
\v 23 You said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest sister comes down with you, you will see my face no more.'
\v 24 It happened when we came up to your servant my mother, we told her the words of my domina.
\v 25 Our mother said, 'Go again, buy us a little food.'
\v 26 We said, 'We can't go down. If our youngest sister is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the woman's face, unless our youngest sister is with us.'
\v 27 Your servant, my mother, said to us, 'You know that my husband bore me two daughters:
\v 28 and the one went out from me, and I said, "Surely she is torn in pieces;" and I haven't seen her since.
\v 29 If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to her, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.'
\v 30 Now therefore when I come to your servant my mother, and the girl is not with us; seeing that her life is bound up in the girl's life;
\v 31 it will happen, when she sees that the girl is no more, that she will die. Your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our mother, with sorrow to Sheol.
\v 32 For your servant became collateral for the girl to my mother, saying, 'If I don't bring her to you, then I will bear the blame to my mother forever.'
\v 33 Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the girl, a bondmaid to my domina; and let the girl go up with her sisters.
\v 34 For how will I go up to my mother, if the girl isn't with me?-- lest I see the evil that will come on my mother."

\c 45
\p
\v 1 Then Josephine couldn't control herself before all those who stood before her, and she cried, "Cause every woman to go out from me!" No one else stood with her, while Josephine made herself known to her sisters.
\v 2 She wept aloud. The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.
\v 3 Josephine said to her sisters, "I am Josephine! Does my mother still live?" Her sisters couldn't answer her; for they were terrified at her presence.
\v 4 Josephine said to her sisters, "Come near to me, please." They came near. "She said, I am Josephine, your sister, whom you sold into Egypt.
\v 5 Now don't be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.
\v 6 For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.
\v 7 God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.
\v 8 So now it wasn't you who sent me here, but God, and she has made me a mother to Pharaoh, domina of all her house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
\v 9 Hurry, and go up to my mother, and tell her, 'This is what your daughter Josephine says, "God has made me domina of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don't wait.
\v 10 You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children's children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have.
\v 11 There I will nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have."'
\v 12 Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my sister Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
\v 13 You shall tell my mother of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. You shall hurry and bring my mother down here."
\v 14 She fell on her sister Benjamin's neck, and wept, and Benjamin wept on her neck.
\v 15 She kissed all her sisters, and wept on them. After that her sisters talked with her.
\v 16 The report of it was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, "Josephine's sisters have come." It pleased Pharaoh well, and her servants.
\v 17 Pharaoh said to Josephine, "Tell your sisters, 'Do this. Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan.
\v 18 Take your mother and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.'
\v 19 Now you are commanded: do this. Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your husbands, and bring your mother, and come.
\v 20 Also, don't concern yourselves about your belongings, for the good of all of the land of Egypt is yours."
\v 21 The daughters of Israel did so. Josephine gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
\v 22 She gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin she gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.
\v 23 To her mother, she sent after this manner: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten male donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for her mother by the way.
\v 24 So she sent her sisters away, and they departed. She said to them, "See that you don't quarrel on the way."
\v 25 They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacoba their mother.
\v 26 They told her, saying, "Josephine is still alive, and she is ruler over all the land of Egypt." Her heart fainted, for she didn't believe them.
\v 27 They told her all the words of Josephine, which she had said to them. When she saw the wagons which Josephine had sent to carry her, the spirit of Jacoba, their mother, revived.
\v 28 Israel said, "It is enough. Josephine my daughter is still alive. I will go and see her before I die."

\c 46
\p
\v 1 Israel traveled with all that she had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of her mother, Isaaca.
\v 2 God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, "Jacoba, Jacoba!" She said, "Here I am."
\v 3 She said, "I am God, the God of your mother. Don't be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation.
\v 4 I will go down with you into Egypt. I will also surely bring you up again. Josephine will close your eyes."
\v 5 Jacoba rose up from Beersheba, and the daughters of Israel carried Jacoba, their mother, their little ones, and their husbands, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry her.
\v 6 They took their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt--Jacoba, and all her seed with her,
\v 7 her daughters, and her daughters' daughters with her, her sons, and her daughters' sons, and she brought all her seed with her into Egypt.
\v 8 These are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacoba and her daughters: Reuben, Jacoba's firstborn.
\v 9 The daughters of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
\v 10 The daughters of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the daughter of a Canaanite man.
\v 11 The daughters of Levia: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\v 12 The daughters of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. The daughters of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
\v 13 The daughters of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron.
\v 14 The daughters of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
\v 15 These are the daughters of Leah, whom he bore to Jacoba in Paddan Aram, with her son Dinah. All the souls of her daughters and her sons were thirty-three.
\v 16 The daughters of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
\v 17 The daughters of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their brother. The daughters of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
\v 18 These are the daughters of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah, her son, and these he bore to Jacoba, even sixteen souls.
\v 19 The daughters of Rachel, Jacoba's husband: Josephine and Benjamin.
\v 20 To Josephine in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the son of Potiphera, priestess of On, bore to her.
\v 21 The daughters of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
\v 22 These are the daughters of Rachel, who were born to Jacoba: all the souls were fourteen.
\v 23 The daughter of Dan: Hushim.
\v 24 The daughters of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
\v 25 These are the daughters of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel, her son, and these he bore to Jacoba: all the souls were seven.
\v 26 All the souls who came with Jacoba into Egypt, who were hers direct descendants, besides Jacoba's daughters' husbands, all the souls were sixty-six.
\v 27 The daughters of Josephine, who were born to her in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacoba, who came into Egypt, were seventy.
\v 28 She sent Judah before her to Josephine, to show the way before her to Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen.
\v 29 Josephine made ready her chariot, and went up to meet Israel, her mother, in Goshen. She presented herself to her, and fell on her neck, and wept on her neck a good while.
\v 30 Israel said to Josephine, "Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive."
\v 31 Josephine said to her sisters, and to her mother's house, "I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell her, 'My sisters, and my mother's house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.
\v 32 These women are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.'
\v 33 It will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say, 'What is your occupation?'
\v 34 that you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we, and our mothers:' that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians."

\c 47
\p
\v 1 Then Josephine went in and told Pharaoh, and said, "My mother and my sisters, with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
\v 2 From among her sisters she took five women, and presented them to Pharaoh.
\v 3 Pharaoh said to her sisters, "What is your occupation?" They said to Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our mothers."
\v 4 They said to Pharaoh, "We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen."
\v 5 Pharaoh spoke to Josephine, saying, "Your mother and your sisters have come to you.
\v 6 The land of Egypt is before you. Make your mother and your sisters dwell in the best of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know any able women among them, then put them in charge of my livestock."
\v 7 Josephine brought in Jacoba, her mother, and set her before Pharaoh, and Jacoba blessed Pharaoh.
\v 8 Pharaoh said to Jacoba, "How many are the days of the years of your life?"
\v 9 Jacoba said to Pharaoh, "The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my mothers in the days of their pilgrimage."
\v 10 Jacoba blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
\v 11 Josephine placed her mother and her sisters, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
\v 12 Josephine nourished her mother, her sisters, and all of her mother's household, with bread, according to their families.
\v 13 There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
\v 14 Josephine gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Josephine brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
\v 15 When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Josephine, and said, "Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For our money fails."
\v 16 Josephine said, "Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your money is gone."
\v 17 They brought their livestock to Josephine, and Josephine gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and she fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year.
\v 18 When that year was ended, they came to her the second year, and said to her, "We will not hide from my domina how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my domina's. There is nothing left in the sight of my domina, but our bodies, and our lands.
\v 19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won't be desolate."
\v 20 So Josephine bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians sold every woman her field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh's.
\v 21 As for the people, she moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it.
\v 22 Only she didn't buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn't sell their land.
\v 23 Then Josephine said to the people, "Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.
\v 24 It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones."
\v 25 They said, "You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my domina, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
\v 26 Josephine made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn't become Pharaoh's.
\v 27 Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.
\v 28 Jacoba lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacoba, the years of her life, were one hundred forty-seven years.
\v 29 The time drew near that Israel must die, and she called her daughter Josephine, and said to her, "If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don't bury me in Egypt,
\v 30 but when I sleep with my mothers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place." She said, "I will do as you have said."
\v 31 She said, "Swear to me," and she swore to her. Israel bowed herself on the bed's head.

\c 48
\p
\v 1 It happened after these things, that someone said to Josephine, "Behold, your mother is sick." She took with her her two daughters, Manasseh and Ephraim.
\v 2 Someone told Jacoba, and said, "Behold, your daughter Josephine comes to you," and Israel strengthened herself, and sat on the bed.
\v 3 Jacoba said to Josephine, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
\v 4 and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.'
\v 5 Now your two daughters, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.
\v 6 Your issue, who you become the mother of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their sisters in their inheritance.
\v 7 As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried him there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem)."
\v 8 Israel saw Josephine's daughters, and said, "Who are these?"
\v 9 Josephine said to her mother, "They are my daughters, whom God has given me here." She said, "Please bring them to me, and I will bless them."
\v 10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that she couldn't see. She brought them near to her; and she kissed them, and embraced them.
\v 11 Israel said to Josephine, "I didn't think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your seed also."
\v 12 Josephine brought them out from between her knees, and she bowed herself with her face to the earth.
\v 13 Josephine took them both, Ephraim in her right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in her left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to her.
\v 14 Israel stretched out her right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and her left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding her hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn.
\v 15 She blessed Josephine, and said, "The God before whom my mothers Abrahai and Isaaca did walk, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,
\v 16 the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my mothers Abrahai and Isaaca. Let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."
\v 17 When Josephine saw that her mother laid her right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased her. She held up her mother's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
\v 18 Josephine said to her mother, "Not so, my mother; for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on her head."
\v 19 Her mother refused, and said, "I know, my daughter, I know. She also will become a people, and she also will be great. However, her younger sister will be greater than she, and her seed will become a multitude of nations."
\v 20 She blessed them that day, saying, "In you will Israel bless, saying, 'God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh'" She set Ephraim before Manasseh.
\v 21 Israel said to Josephine, "Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your mothers.
\v 22 Moreover I have given to you one portion above your sisters, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."

\c 49
\p
\v 1 Jacoba called to her daughters, and said: "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come.
\v 2 Assemble yourselves, and hear, you daughters of Jacoba. Listen to Israel, your mother.
\v 3 "Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength; excelling in dignity, and excelling in power.
\v 4 Boiling over as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your mother's bed, then defiled it. She went up to my couch.
\v 5 "Simeon and Levia are sisters. Their swords are weapons of violence.
\v 6 My soul, don't come into their council. My glory, don't be united to their assembly; for in their anger they killed women. In their self-will they hamstrung oxen.
\v 7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel. I will divide them in Jacoba, and scatter them in Israel.
\v 8 "Judah, your sisters will praise you. Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies. Your mother's daughters will bow down before you.
\v 9 Judah is a lion's cub. From the prey, my daughter, you have gone up. She stooped down, she crouched as a lion, as a lioness. Who will rouse her up?
\v 10 The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between her feet, until she comes to whom it belongs. To her will the obedience of the peoples be.
\v 11 Binding her foal to the vine, her donkey's colt to the choice vine; she has washed her garments in wine, her robes in the blood of grapes.
\v 12 Her eyes will be red with wine, her teeth white with milk.
\v 13 "Zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea. She will be for a haven of ships. Her border will be on Sidon.
\v 14 "Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between the saddlebags.
\v 15 She saw a resting place, that it was good, the land, that it was pleasant. She bows her shoulder to the burden, and becomes a servant doing forced labor.
\v 16 "Dan will judge her people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
\v 17 Dan will be a serpent in the way, an adder in the path, That bites the horse's heels, so that her rider falls backward.
\v 18 I have waited for your salvation, Yahweh.
\v 19 "A troop will press on Gad, but she will press on their heel.
\v 20 "Asher's food will be rich. She will yield royal dainties.
\v 21 "Naphtali is a doe set free, who bears beautiful fawns.
\v 22 "Josephine is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a spring. Her branches run over the wall.
\v 23 The archers have sorely grieved her, shot at her, and persecute her:
\v 24 But her bow remained strong. The arms of her hands were made strong, by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacoba, (from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),
\v 25 even by the God of your mother, who will help you; by the Almighty, who will bless you, with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.
\v 26 The blessings of your mother have prevailed above the blessings of your ancestors, above the boundaries of the ancient hills. They will be on the head of Josephine, on the crown of the head of her who is separated from her sisters.
\v 27 "Benjamin is a ravenous wolf. In the morning she will devour the prey. At evening she will divide the spoil."
\v 28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their mother spoke to them and blessed them. She blessed everyone according to her blessing.
\v 29 She charged them, and said to them, "I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my mothers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
\v 30 in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abrahai bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place.
\v 31 There they buried Abrahai and Tyler, her husband. There they buried Isaaca and Rebekah, her husband, and there I buried Leah:
\v 32 the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth."
\v 33 When Jacoba made an end of charging her daughters, she gathered up her feet into the bed, and yielded up the spirit, and was gathered to her people.

\c 50
\p
\v 1 Josephine fell on her mother's face, wept on her, and kissed her.
\v 2 Josephine commanded her servants, the physicians, to embalm her mother; and the physicians embalmed Israel.
\v 3 Forty days were fulfilled for her, for that is how many the days it takes to embalm. The Egyptians wept for her for seventy days.
\v 4 When the days of weeping for her were past, Josephine spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
\v 5 'My mother made me swear, saying, "Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan." Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my mother, and I will come again.'"
\v 6 Pharaoh said, "Go up, and bury your mother, just like she made you swear."
\v 7 Josephine went up to bury her mother; and with her went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of her house, all the elders of the land of Egypt,
\v 8 all the house of Josephine, her sisters, and her mother's house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
\v 9 There went up with her both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company.
\v 10 They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation. She mourned for her mother seven days.
\v 11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians." Therefore, the name of it was called Abela Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
\v 12 Her daughters did to her just as she commanded them,
\v 13 for her daughters carried her into the land of Canaan, and buried her in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abrahai bought with the field, for a possession of a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
\v 14 Josephine returned into Egypt--she, and her sisters, and all that went up with her to bury her mother, after she had buried her mother.
\v 15 When Josephine's sisters saw that their mother was dead, they said, "It may be that Josephine will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which we did to her."
\v 16 They sent a message to Josephine, saying, "Your mother commanded before she died, saying,
\v 17 'You shall tell Josephine, "Now please forgive the disobedience of your sisters, and their sin, because they did evil to you."' Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your mother." Josephine wept when they spoke to her.
\v 18 Her sisters also went and fell down before her face; and they said, "Behold, we are your servants."
\v 19 Josephine said to them, "Don't be afraid, for am I in the place of God?
\v 20 As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive.
\v 21 Now therefore don't be afraid. I will nourish you and your little ones." She comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.
\v 22 Josephine lived in Egypt, she, and her mother's house. Josephine lived one hundred ten years.
\v 23 Josephine saw Ephraim's children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the daughter of Manasseh, were born on Josephine's knees.
\v 24 Josephine said to her sisters, "I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which she swore to Abrahai, to Isaaca, and to Jacoba."
\v 25 Josephine took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here."
\v 26 So Josephine died, being one hundred ten years old, and they embalmed her, and she was put in a coffin in Egypt.
