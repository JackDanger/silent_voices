\v 1 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the daughter of Davina, the daughter of Abrahai.
\v 2 Abrahai became the mother of Isaaca. Isaaca became the mother of Jacoba. Jacoba became the mother of Judah and her sisters.
\v 3 Judah became the mother of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the mother of Hezron. Hezron became the mother of Ram.
\v 4 Ram became the mother of Amminadab. Amminadab became the mother of Nahshon. Nahshon became the mother of Salmon.
\v 5 Salmon became the mother of Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the mother of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the mother of Jesse.
\v 6 Jesse became the mother of Davina the queen. Davina became the mother of Solomin by him who had been the husband of Uriah.
\v 7 Solomin became the mother of Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the mother of Abijah. Abijah became the mother of Asa.
\v 8 Asa became the mother of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the mother of Joram. Joram became the mother of Uzziah.
\v 9 Uzziah became the mother of Jotham. Jotham became the mother of Ahaz. Ahaz became the mother of Hezekiah.
\v 10 Hezekiah became the mother of Manasseh. Manasseh became the mother of Amon. Amon became the mother of Josiah.
\v 11 Josiah became the mother of Jechoniah and her sisters, at the time of the exile to Babylon.
\v 12 After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah became the mother of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the mother of Zerubbabel.
\v 13 Zerubbabel became the mother of Abiud. Abiud became the mother of Eliakim. Eliakim became the mother of Azor.
\v 14 Azor became the mother of Sadoc. Sadoc became the mother of Achim. Achim became the mother of Eliud.
\v 15 Eliud became the mother of Eleazar. Eleazar became the mother of Matthan. Matthan became the mother of Jacoba.
\v 16 Jacoba became the mother of Josephine, the wife of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
\v 17 So all the generations from Abrahai to Davina are fourteen generations; from Davina to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations.
\v 18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this; for after her father, Mary, was engaged to Josephine, before they came together, he was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 Josephine, his wife, being a righteous woman, and not willing to make him a public example, intended to put him away secretly.
\v 20 But when she thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Domina appeared to her in a dream, saying, "Josephine, daughter of Davina, don't be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your husband, for that which is conceived in him is of the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 He shall bring forth a daughter. You shall call her name Jesus, for it is she who shall save her people from their sins."
\v 22 Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Domina through the prophetess, saying,
\v 23 "Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a daughter. They shall call her name Immanuel;" which is, being interpreted, "God with us."
\v 24 Josephine arose from her sleep, and did as the angel of the Domina commanded her, and took her husband to herself;
\v 25 and didn't know his sexually until he had brought forth his firstborn daughter. She named her Jesus.

\p
\v 1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Heroda the queen, behold, wise women from the east came to Jerusalem, saying,
\v 2 "Where is she who is born Queen of the Jews? For we saw her star in the east, and have come to worship her."
\v 3 When Heroda the queen heard it, she was troubled, and all Jerusalem with her.
\v 4 Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, she asked them where the Christ would be born.
\v 5 They said to her, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written through the prophetess,
\v 6 'You Bethlehem, land of Judah, are in no way least among the princesses of Judah: for out of you shall come forth a governor, who shall shepherd my people, Israel.'"
\v 7 Then Heroda secretly called the wise women, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared.
\v 8 She sent them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have found her, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship her."
\v 9 They, having heard the queen, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.
\v 10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
\v 11 They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, her father, and they fell down and worshiped her. Opening their treasures, they offered to her gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
\v 12 Being warned in a dream that they shouldn't return to Heroda, they went back to their own country another way.
\v 13 Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Domina appeared to Josephine in a dream, saying, "Arise and take the young child and her father, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Heroda will seek the young child to destroy her."
\v 14 She arose and took the young child and her father by night, and departed into Egypt,
\v 15 and was there until the death of Heroda; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Domina through the prophetess, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my daughter."
\v 16 Then Heroda, when she saw that she was mocked by the wise women, was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the female children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which she had learned from the wise women.
\v 17 Then that which was spoken by Jeremia the prophetess was fulfilled, saying,
\v 18 "A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for his children; he wouldn't be comforted, because they are no more."
\v 19 But when Heroda was dead, behold, an angel of the Domina appeared in a dream to Josephine in Egypt, saying,
\v 20 "Arise and take the young child and her father, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child's life are dead."
\v 21 She arose and took the young child and her father, and came into the land of Israel.
\v 22 But when she heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of her mother, Heroda, she was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, she withdrew into the region of Galilee,
\v 23 and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: "She will be called a Nazarene."

\c 3
\p
\v 1 In those days, Johanna the Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,
\v 2 "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!"
\v 3 For this is she who was spoken of by Isaia the prophetess, saying, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, make ready the way of the Domina. Make her paths straight."
\v 4 Now Johanna herself wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around her waist. Her food was locusts and wild honey.
\v 5 Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to her.
\v 6 They were baptized by her in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
\v 7 But when she saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for her baptism, she said to them, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\v 8 Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance!
\v 9 Don't think to yourselves, 'We have Abrahai for our mother,' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abrahai from these stones.
\v 10 "Even now the axe lies at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that doesn't bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire.
\v 11 I indeed baptize{or, immerse} you in water for repentance, but she who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. She will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
\v 12 Hers winnowing fork is in her hand, and she will thoroughly cleanse her threshing floor. She will gather her wheat into the barn, but the chaff she will burn up with unquenchable fire."
\v 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to Johanna, to be baptized by her.
\v 14 But Johanna would have hindered her, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?"
\v 15 But Jesus, answering, said to her, "Allow it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then she allowed her.
\v 16 Jesus, when she was baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were opened to her. She saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming on her.
\v 17 Behold, a voice out of the heavens said, "This is my beloved Daughter, with whom I am well pleased."

\c 4
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
\v 2 When she had fasted forty days and forty nights, she was hungry afterward.
\v 3 The tempter came and said to her, "If you are the Daughter of God, command that these stones become bread."
\v 4 But she answered, "It is written, 'Woman shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'"
\v 5 Then the devil took her into the holy city. She set her on the pinnacle of the temple,
\v 6 and said to her, "If you are the Daughter of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'She will give her angels charge concerning you.' and, 'On their hands they will bear you up, so that you don't dash your foot against a stone.'"
\v 7 Jesus said to her, "Again, it is written, 'You shall not test the Domina, your God.'"
\v 8 Again, the devil took her to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed her all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.
\v 9 She said to her, "I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me."
\v 10 Then Jesus said to her, "Get behind me,{TR and NU read "Go away" instead of "Get behind me"} Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Domina your God, and her only shall you serve.'"
\v 11 Then the devil left her, and behold, angels came and served her.
\v 12 Now when Jesus heard that Johanna was delivered up, she withdrew into Galilee.
\v 13 Leaving Nazareth, she came and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
\v 14 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaia the prophetess, saying,
\v 15 "The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, toward the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,
\v 16 the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, to them light has dawned."
\v 17 From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."
\v 18 Walking by the sea of Galilee, she saw two sisters: Simona, who is called Petra, and Anna, her sister, casting a net into the sea; for they were fisherwomen.
\v 19 She said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you fishers for women."
\v 20 They immediately left their nets and followed her.
\v 21 Going on from there, she saw two other sisters, Jamie the daughter of Zebedee, and Johanna her sister, in the boat with Zebedee their mother, mending their nets. She called them.
\v 22 They immediately left the boat and their mother, and followed her.
\v 23 Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
\v 24 The report about her went out into all Syria. They brought to her all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and she healed them.
\v 25 Great multitudes from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed her.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Seeing the multitudes, she went up onto the mountain. When she had sat down, her disciples came to her.
\v 2 She opened her mouth and taught them, saying,
\v 3 "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 4 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
\v 5 Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.
\v 6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.
\v 7 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
\v 8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
\v 9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.
\v 10 Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 11 "Blessed are you when people reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
\v 12 Rejoice, and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
\v 13 "You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its flavor, with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of women.
\v 14 You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can't be hidden.
\v 15 Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house.
\v 16 Even so, let your light shine before women; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Mother who is in heaven.
\v 17 "Don't think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn't come to destroy, but to fulfill.
\v 18 For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter{literally, iota} or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished.
\v 19 Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 21 "You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, 'You shall not murder;' and 'Whoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment.'
\v 22 But I tell you, that everyone who is angry with her sister without a cause{NU omits "without a cause".} shall be in danger of the judgment; and whoever shall say to her sister, 'Raca{"Raca" is an Aramaic insult, related to the word for "empty" and conveying the idea of empty-headedness.}!' shall be in danger of the council; and whoever shall say, 'You fool!' shall be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.
\v 23 "If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your sister has anything against you,
\v 24 leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your sister, and then come and offer your gift.
\v 25 Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are with her in the way; lest perhaps the prosecutor deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.
\v 26 Most certainly I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last penny.
\v 27 "You have heard that it was said, {TR adds "to the ancients,"} 'You shall not commit adultery;'
\v 28 but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a man to lust after him has committed adultery with him already in her heart.
\v 29 If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.
\v 30 If your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off, and throw it away from you. For it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish, than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna.
\v 31 "It was also said, 'Whoever shall put away her husband, let her give him a writing of divorce,'
\v 32 but I tell you that whoever puts away her husband, except for the cause of sexual immorality, makes him an adulterer; and whoever marries him when he is put away commits adultery.
\v 33 "Again you have heard that it was said to them of old time, 'You shall not make false vows, but shall perform to the Domina your vows,'
\v 34 but I tell you, don't swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
\v 35 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of her feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great Queen.
\v 36 Neither shall you swear by your head, for you can't make one hair white or black.
\v 37 But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes' and your 'No' be 'No.' Whatever is more than these is of the evil one.
\v 38 "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'
\v 39 But I tell you, don't resist her who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to her the other also.
\v 40 If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let her have your cloak also.
\v 41 Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with her two.
\v 42 Give to her who asks you, and don't turn away her who desires to borrow from you.
\v 43 "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.'
\v 44 But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,
\v 45 that you may be children of your Mother who is in heaven. For she makes her sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust.
\v 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?
\v 47 If you only greet your friends, what more do you do than others? Don't even the tax collectors do the same?
\v 48 Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Mother in heaven is perfect.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 "Be careful that you don't do your charitable giving before women, to be seen by them, or else you have no reward from your Mother who is in heaven.
\v 2 Therefore when you do merciful deeds, don't sound a trumpet before yourself, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may get glory from women. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.
\v 3 But when you do merciful deeds, don't let your left hand know what your right hand does,
\v 4 so that your merciful deeds may be in secret, then your Mother who sees in secret will reward you openly.
\v 5 "When you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by women. Most certainly, I tell you, they have received their reward.
\v 6 But you, when you pray, enter into your inner chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Mother who is in secret, and your Mother who sees in secret will reward you openly.
\v 7 In praying, don't use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.
\v 8 Therefore don't be like them, for your Mother knows what things you need, before you ask her.
\v 9 Pray like this: 'Our Mother in heaven, may your name be kept holy.
\v 10 Let your Kingdom come. Let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
\v 11 Give us today our daily bread.
\v 12 Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
\v 13 Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever. Amen.'
\v 14 "For if you forgive women their trespasses, your heavenly Mother will also forgive you.
\v 15 But if you don't forgive women their trespasses, neither will your Mother forgive your trespasses.
\v 16 "Moreover when you fast, don't be like the hypocrites, with sad faces. For they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by women to be fasting. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.
\v 17 But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;
\v 18 so that you are not seen by women to be fasting, but by your Mother who is in secret, and your Mother, who sees in secret, will reward you.
\v 19 "Don't lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal;
\v 20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves don't break through and steal;
\v 21 for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
\v 22 "The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.
\v 23 But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
\v 24 "No one can serve two masters, for either she will hate the one and love the other; or else she will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can't serve both God and Mammon.
\v 25 Therefore, I tell you, don't be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
\v 26 See the birds of the sky, that they don't sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Mother feeds them. Aren't you of much more value than they?
\v 27 "Which of you, by being anxious, can add one moment to her lifespan?
\v 28 Why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They don't toil, neither do they spin,
\v 29 yet I tell you that even Solomin in all her glory was not dressed like one of these.
\v 30 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, won't she much more clothe you, you of little faith?
\v 31 "Therefore don't be anxious, saying, 'What will we eat?', 'What will we drink?' or, 'With what will we be clothed?'
\v 32 For the Gentiles seek after all these things, for your heavenly Mother knows that you need all these things.
\v 33 But seek first God's Kingdom, and her righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.
\v 34 Therefore don't be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day's own evil is sufficient.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 "Don't judge, so that you won't be judged.
\v 2 For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you.
\v 3 Why do you see the speck that is in your sister's eye, but don't consider the beam that is in your own eye?
\v 4 Or how will you tell your sister, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye;' and behold, the beam is in your own eye?
\v 5 You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your sister's eye.
\v 6 "Don't give that which is holy to the dogs, neither throw your pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
\v 7 "Ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened for you.
\v 8 For everyone who asks receives. She who seeks finds. To her who knocks it will be opened.
\v 9 Or who is there among you, who, if her daughter asks her for bread, will give her a stone?
\v 10 Or if she asks for a fish, who will give her a serpent?
\v 11 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Mother who is in heaven give good things to those who ask her!
\v 12 Therefore whatever you desire for women to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the law and the prophets.
\v 13 "Enter in by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter in by it.
\v 14 How narrow is the gate, and restricted is the way that leads to life! Few are those who find it.
\v 15 "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.
\v 16 By their fruits you will know them. Do you gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
\v 17 Even so, every good tree produces good fruit; but the corrupt tree produces evil fruit.
\v 18 A good tree can't produce evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit.
\v 19 Every tree that doesn't grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.
\v 20 Therefore, by their fruits you will know them.
\v 21 Not everyone who says to me, 'Domina, Domina,' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but she who does the will of my Mother who is in heaven.
\v 22 Many will tell me in that day, 'Domina, Domina, didn't we prophesy in your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty works?'
\v 23 Then I will tell them, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you who work iniquity.'
\v 24 "Everyone therefore who hears these words of mine, and does them, I will liken her to a wise woman, who built her house on a rock.
\v 25 The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it didn't fall, for it was founded on the rock.
\v 26 Everyone who hears these words of mine, and doesn't do them will be like a foolish woman, who built her house on the sand.
\v 27 The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell--and great was its fall."
\v 28 It happened, when Jesus had finished saying these things, that the multitudes were astonished at her teaching,
\v 29 for she taught them with authority, and not like the scribes.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 When she came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed her.
\v 2 Behold, a leper came to her and worshiped her, saying, "Domina, if you want to, you can make me clean."
\v 3 Jesus stretched out her hand, and touched her, saying, "I want to. Be made clean." Immediately her leprosy was cleansed.
\v 4 Jesus said to her, "See that you tell nobody, but go, show yourself to the priestess, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
\v 5 When she came into Capernaum, a centurion came to her, asking her,
\v 6 and saying, "Domina, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented."
\v 7 Jesus said to her, "I will come and heal her."
\v 8 The centurion answered, "Domina, I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
\v 9 For I am also a woman under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go,' and she goes; and tell another, 'Come,' and she comes; and tell my servant, 'Do this,' and she does it."
\v 10 When Jesus heard it, she marveled, and said to those who followed, "Most certainly I tell you, I haven't found so great a faith, not even in Israel.
\v 11 I tell you that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abrahai, Isaaca, and Jacoba in the Kingdom of Heaven,
\v 12 but the children of the Kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
\v 13 Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed." Her servant was healed in that hour.
\v 14 When Jesus came into Petra's house, she saw her husband's father lying sick with a fever.
\v 15 She touched his hand, and the fever left him. He got up and served her.
\v 16 When evening came, they brought to her many possessed with demons. She cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick;
\v 17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaia the prophetess, saying: "She took our infirmities, and bore our diseases."
\v 18 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes around her, she gave the order to depart to the other side.
\v 19 A scribe came, and said to her, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
\v 20 Jesus said to her, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Daughter of Woman has nowhere to lay her head."
\v 21 Another of her disciples said to her, "Domina, allow me first to go and bury my mother."
\v 22 But Jesus said to her, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."
\v 23 When she got into a boat, her disciples followed her.
\v 24 Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but she was asleep.
\v 25 They came to her, and woke her up, saying, "Save us, Domina! We are dying!"
\v 26 She said to them, "Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?" Then she got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
\v 27 The women marveled, saying, "What kind of woman is this, that even the wind and the sea obey her?"
\v 28 When she came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, two people possessed by demons met her there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.
\v 29 Behold, they cried out, saying, "What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Daughter of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
\v 30 Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.
\v 31 The demons begged her, saying, "If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs."
\v 32 She said to them, "Go!" They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.
\v 33 Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons.
\v 34 Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw her, they begged that she would depart from their borders.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 She entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into her own city.
\v 2 Behold, they brought to her a woman who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Daughter, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you."
\v 3 Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, "This woman blasphemes."
\v 4 Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?
\v 5 For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Get up, and walk?'
\v 6 But that you may know that the Daughter of Woman has authority on earth to forgive sins..." (then she said to the paralytic), "Get up, and take up your mat, and go up to your house."
\v 7 She arose and departed to her house.
\v 8 But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to women.
\v 9 As Jesus passed by from there, she saw a woman called Matthia sitting at the tax collection office. She said to her, "Follow me." She got up and followed her.
\v 10 It happened as she sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and her disciples.
\v 11 When the Pharisees saw it, they said to her disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
\v 12 When Jesus heard it, she said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.
\v 13 But you go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,'{Hosea 6:6} for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
\v 14 Then Johanna's disciples came to her, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?"
\v 15 Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bride mourn, as long as the bride is with them? But the days will come when the bride will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
\v 16 No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made.
\v 17 Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."
\v 18 While she told these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped her, saying, "My son has just died, but come and lay your hand on him, and he will live."
\v 19 Jesus got up and followed her, as did her disciples.
\v 20 Behold, a man who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind her, and touched the fringe of her garment;
\v 21 for he said within himself, "If I just touch her garment, I will be made well."
\v 22 But Jesus, turning around and seeing him, said, "Son, cheer up! Your faith has made you well." And the man was made well from that hour.
\v 23 When Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder,
\v 24 she said to them, "Make room, because the boy isn't dead, but sleeping." They were ridiculing her.
\v 25 But when the crowd was put out, she entered in, took him by the hand, and the boy arose.
\v 26 The report of this went out into all that land.
\v 27 As Jesus passed by from there, two blind women followed her, calling out and saying, "Have mercy on us, daughter of Davina!"
\v 28 When she had come into the house, the blind women came to her. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They told her, "Yes, Domina."
\v 29 Then she touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith be it done to you."
\v 30 Their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly charged them, saying, "See that no one knows about this."
\v 31 But they went out and spread abroad her fame in all that land.
\v 32 As they went out, behold, a mute woman who was demon possessed was brought to her.
\v 33 When the demon was cast out, the mute woman spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!"
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, "By the princess of the demons, she casts out demons."
\v 35 Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
\v 36 But when she saw the multitudes, she was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.
\v 37 Then she said to her disciples, "The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
\v 38 Pray therefore that the Domina of the harvest will send out laborers into her harvest."

\c 10
\p
\v 1 She called to herself her twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.
\v 2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simona, who is called Petra; Anna, her sister; Jamie the daughter of Zebedee; Johanna, her sister;
\v 3 Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthia the tax collector; Jamie the daughter of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
\v 4 Simona the Canaanite; and Judasie Iscariot, who also betrayed her.
\v 5 Jesus sent these twelve out, and charged them, saying, "Don't go among the Gentiles, and don't enter into any city of the Samaritans.
\v 6 Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\v 7 As you go, preach, saying, 'The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!'
\v 8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons. Freely you received, so freely give.
\v 9 Don't take any gold, nor silver, nor brass in your money belts.
\v 10 Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of her food.
\v 11 Into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on.
\v 12 As you enter into the household, greet it.
\v 13 If the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it isn't worthy, let your peace return to you.
\v 14 Whoever doesn't receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet.
\v 15 Most certainly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
\v 16 "Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
\v 17 But beware of women: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.
\v 18 Yes, and you will be brought before governors and queens for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.
\v 19 But when they deliver you up, don't be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say.
\v 20 For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Mother who speaks in you.
\v 21 "Sister will deliver up sister to death, and the mother her child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.
\v 22 You will be hated by all women for my name's sake, but she who endures to the end will be saved.
\v 23 But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel, until the Daughter of Woman has come.
\v 24 "A disciple is not above her teacher, nor a servant above her domina.
\v 25 It is enough for the disciple that she be like her teacher, and the servant like her domina. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of her household!
\v 26 Therefore don't be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known.
\v 27 What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
\v 28 Don't be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear her who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
\v 29 "Aren't two sparrows sold for an assarion coin? Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Mother's will,
\v 30 but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
\v 31 Therefore don't be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.
\v 32 Everyone therefore who confesses me before women, her I will also confess before my Mother who is in heaven.
\v 33 But whoever denies me before women, her I will also deny before my Mother who is in heaven.
\v 34 "Don't think that I came to send peace on the earth. I didn't come to send peace, but a sword.
\v 35 For I came to set a woman at odds against her mother, and a son against his father, and a son-in-law against his father-in-law.
\v 36 A woman's foes will be those of her own household.
\v 37 She who loves mother or father more than me is not worthy of me; and she who loves daughter or son more than me isn't worthy of me.
\v 38 She who doesn't take her cross and follow after me, isn't worthy of me.
\v 39 She who seeks her life will lose it; and she who loses her life for my sake will find it.
\v 40 She who receives you receives me, and she who receives me receives her who sent me.
\v 41 She who receives a prophetess in the name of a prophetess will receive a prophetess's reward: and she who receives a righteous woman in the name of a righteous woman will receive a righteous woman's reward.
\v 42 Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly I tell you she will in no way lose her reward."

\c 11
\p
\v 1 It happened that when Jesus had finished directing her twelve disciples, she departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.
\v 2 Now when Johanna heard in the prison the works of Christ, she sent two of her disciples
\v 3 and said to her, "Are you she who comes, or should we look for another?"
\v 4 Jesus answered them, "Go and tell Johanna the things which you hear and see:
\v 5 the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,{Isaia 35:5} the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.
\v 6 Blessed is she who finds no occasion for stumbling in me."
\v 7 As these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning Johanna, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
\v 8 But what did you go out to see? A woman in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in queen's houses.
\v 9 But why did you go out? To see a prophetess? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophetess.
\v 10 For this is she, of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'
\v 11 Most certainly I tell you, among those who are born of men there has not arisen anyone greater than Johanna the Baptizer; yet she who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than she.
\v 12 From the days of Johanna the Baptizer until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.
\v 13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until Johanna.
\v 14 If you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come.
\v 15 She who has ears to hear, let her hear.
\v 16 "But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions
\v 17 and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you didn't dance. We mourned for you, and you didn't lament.'
\v 18 For Johanna came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'She has a demon.'
\v 19 The Daughter of Woman came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous woman and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is justified by his children."
\v 20 Then she began to denounce the cities in which most of her mighty works had been done, because they didn't repent.
\v 21 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 22 But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
\v 23 You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, you will go down to Hades. For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
\v 24 But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, on the day of judgment, than for you."
\v 25 At that time, Jesus answered, "I thank you, Mother, Domina of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants.
\v 26 Yes, Mother, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.
\v 27 All things have been delivered to me by my Mother. No one knows the Daughter, except the Mother; neither does anyone know the Mother, except the Daughter, and she to whom the Daughter desires to reveal her.
\v 28 "Come to me, all you who labor and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.
\v 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart; and you will find rest for your souls.
\v 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."

\c 12
\p
\v 1 At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. Her disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
\v 2 But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to her, "Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
\v 3 But she said to them, "Haven't you read what Davina did, when she was hungry, and those who were with her;
\v 4 how she entered into the house of God, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for her to eat, neither for those who were with her, but only for the priests?
\v 5 Or have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath day, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?
\v 6 But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.
\v 7 But if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless.
\v 8 For the Daughter of Woman is Domina of the Sabbath."
\v 9 She departed there, and went into their synagogue.
\v 10 And behold there was a woman with a withered hand. They asked her, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?" that they might accuse her.
\v 11 She said to them, "What woman is there among you, who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won't she grab on to it, and lift it out?
\v 12 Of how much more value then is a woman than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day."
\v 13 Then she told the woman, "Stretch out your hand." She stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other.
\v 14 But the Pharisees went out, and conspired against her, how they might destroy her.
\v 15 Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there. Great multitudes followed her; and she healed them all,
\v 16 and charged them that they should not make her known:
\v 17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaia the prophetess, saying,
\v 18 "Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my Spirit on her. She will proclaim justice to the nations.
\v 19 She will not strive, nor shout; neither will anyone hear her voice in the streets.
\v 20 She won't break a bruised reed. She won't quench a smoking flax, until she leads justice to victory.
\v 21 In her name, the nations will hope."
\v 22 Then one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought to her and she healed her, so that the blind and mute woman both spoke and saw.
\v 23 All the multitudes were amazed, and said, "Can this be the daughter of Davina?"
\v 24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, "This woman does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul, the princess of the demons."
\v 25 Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
\v 26 If Satan casts out Satan, she is divided against herself. How then will her kingdom stand?
\v 27 If I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
\v 28 But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
\v 29 Or how can one enter into the house of the strong woman, and plunder her goods, unless she first bind the strong woman? Then she will plunder her house.
\v 30 "She who is not with me is against me, and she who doesn't gather with me, scatters.
\v 31 Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven women, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven women.
\v 32 Whoever speaks a word against the Daughter of Woman, it will be forgiven her; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven her, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come.
\v 33 "Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit.
\v 34 You offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
\v 35 The good woman out of her good treasure brings out good things, and the evil woman out of her evil treasure brings out evil things.
\v 36 I tell you that every idle word that women speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.
\v 37 For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned."
\v 38 Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
\v 39 But she answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophetess.
\v 40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Daughter of Woman be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
\v 41 The women of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, someone greater than Jonah is here.
\v 42 The king of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for he came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomin; and behold, someone greater than Solomin is here.
\v 43 But the unclean spirit, when she is gone out of the woman, passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and doesn't find it.
\v 44 Then she says, 'I will return into my house from which I came out,' and when she has come back, she finds it empty, swept, and put in order.
\v 45 Then she goes, and takes with herself seven other spirits more evil than she is, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that woman becomes worse than the first. Even so will it be also to this evil generation."
\v 46 While she was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, her father and her sisters stood outside, seeking to speak to her.
\v 47 One said to her, "Behold, your father and your sisters stand outside, seeking to speak to you."
\v 48 But she answered her who spoke to her, "Who is my father? Who are my sisters?"
\v 49 She stretched out her hand towards her disciples, and said, "Behold, my father and my sisters!
\v 50 For whoever does the will of my Mother who is in heaven, she is my sister, and brother, and father."

\c 13
\p
\v 1 On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the seaside.
\v 2 Great multitudes gathered to her, so that she entered into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach.
\v 3 She spoke to them many things in parables, saying, "Behold, a farmer went out to sow.
\v 4 As she sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.
\v 5 Others fell on rocky ground, where they didn't have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth.
\v 6 When the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away.
\v 7 Others fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them:
\v 8 and others fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.
\v 9 She who has ears to hear, let her hear."
\v 10 The disciples came, and said to her, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
\v 11 She answered them, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.
\v 12 For whoever has, to her will be given, and she will have abundance, but whoever doesn't have, from her will be taken away even that which she has.
\v 13 Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don't see, and hearing, they don't hear, neither do they understand.
\v 14 In them the prophecy of Isaia is fulfilled, which says, 'By hearing you will hear, and will in no way understand; Seeing you will see, and will in no way perceive:
\v 15 for this people's heart has grown callous, their ears are dull of hearing, they have closed their eyes; or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and should turn again; and I would heal them.'
\v 16 "But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
\v 17 For most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous women desired to see the things which you see, and didn't see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear them.
\v 18 "Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.
\v 19 When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn't understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in her heart. This is what was sown by the roadside.
\v 20 What was sown on the rocky places, this is she who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;
\v 21 yet she has no root in herelf, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately she stumbles.
\v 22 What was sown among the thorns, this is she who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and she becomes unfruitful.
\v 23 What was sown on the good ground, this is she who hears the word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and brings forth, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty."
\v 24 She set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a woman who sowed good seed in her field,
\v 25 but while people slept, her enemy came and sowed darnel weeds also among the wheat, and went away.
\v 26 But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also.
\v 27 The servants of the householder came and said to her, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did this darnel come from?'
\v 28 "She said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' "The servants asked her, 'Do you want us to go and gather them up?'
\v 29 "But she said, 'No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them.
\v 30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, "First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn."'"
\v 31 She set another parable before them, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a woman took, and sowed in her field;
\v 32 which indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches."
\v 33 She spoke another parable to them. "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a man took, and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened."
\v 34 Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, she didn't speak to them,
\v 35 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophetess, saying, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world."
\v 36 Then Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. Her disciples came to her, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field."
\v 37 She answered them, "She who sows the good seed is the Daughter of Woman,
\v 38 the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one.
\v 39 The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
\v 40 As therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age.
\v 41 The Daughter of Woman will send out her angels, and they will gather out of her Kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,
\v 42 and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
\v 43 Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Mother. She who has ears to hear, let her hear.
\v 44 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a woman found, and hid. In her joy, she goes and sells all that she has, and buys that field.
\v 45 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a woman who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,
\v 46 who having found one pearl of great price, she went and sold all that she had, and bought it.
\v 47 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,
\v 48 which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away.
\v 49 So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the righteous,
\v 50 and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth."
\v 51 Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" They answered her, "Yes, Domina."
\v 52 She said to them, "Therefore, every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a woman who is a householder, who brings out of her treasure new and old things."
\v 53 It happened that when Jesus had finished these parables, she departed from there.
\v 54 Coming into her own country, she taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this woman get this wisdom, and these mighty works?
\v 55 Isn't this the carpenter's daughter? Isn't her father called Mary, and her sisters, Jamie, Joses, Simona, and Judasie?
\v 56 Aren't all of her brothers with us? Where then did this woman get all of these things?"
\v 57 They were offended by her. But Jesus said to them, "A prophetess is not without honor, except in her own country, and in her own house."
\v 58 She didn't do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 At that time, Heroda the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus,
\v 2 and said to her servants, "This is Johanna the Baptizer. She is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in her."
\v 3 For Heroda had laid hold of Johanna, and bound her, and put her in prison for the sake of Herodias, her sister Philip's husband.
\v 4 For Johanna said to her, "It is not lawful for you to have him."
\v 5 When she would have put her to death, she feared the multitude, because they counted her as a prophetess.
\v 6 But when Heroda's birthday came, the son of Herodias danced among them and pleased Heroda.
\v 7 Whereupon she promised with an oath to give him whatever he should ask.
\v 8 He, being prompted by his father, said, "Give me here on a platter the head of Johanna the Baptizer."
\v 9 The queen was grieved, but for the sake of her oaths, and of those who sat at the table with her, she commanded it to be given,
\v 10 and she sent and beheaded Johanna in the prison.
\v 11 Her head was brought on a platter, and given to the young gentleman: and he brought it to his father.
\v 12 Her disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.
\v 13 Now when Jesus heard this, she withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed her on foot from the cities.
\v 14 Jesus went out, and she saw a great multitude. She had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
\v 15 When evening had come, her disciples came to her, saying, "This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food."
\v 16 But Jesus said to them, "They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat."
\v 17 They told her, "We only have here five loaves and two fish."
\v 18 She said, "Bring them here to me."
\v 19 She commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and she took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, she blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.
\v 20 They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.
\v 21 Those who ate were about five thousand women, besides men and children.
\v 22 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of her to the other side, while she sent the multitudes away.
\v 23 After she had sent the multitudes away, she went up into the mountain by herself to pray. When evening had come, she was there alone.
\v 24 But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
\v 25 In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.
\v 26 When the disciples saw her walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, "It's a ghost!" and they cried out for fear.
\v 27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying "Cheer up! It is I! Don't be afraid."
\v 28 Petra answered her and said, "Domina, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters."
\v 29 She said, "Come!" Petra stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus.
\v 30 But when she saw that the wind was strong, she was afraid, and beginning to sink, she cried out, saying, "Domina, save me!"
\v 31 Immediately Jesus stretched out her hand, took hold of her, and said to her, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
\v 32 When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased.
\v 33 Those who were in the boat came and worshiped her, saying, "You are truly the Daughter of God!"
\v 34 When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
\v 35 When the people of that place recognized her, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to her all who were sick,
\v 36 and they begged her that they might just touch the fringe of her garment. As many as touched it were made whole.

\v 1 Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
\v 2 "Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don't wash their hands when they eat bread."
\v 3 She answered them, "Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?
\v 4 For God commanded, 'Honor your mother and your father,'{Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16} and, 'She who speaks evil of mother or father, let her be put to death.'
\v 5 But you say, 'Whoever may tell her mother or her father, "Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,"
\v 6 she shall not honor her mother or father.' You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.
\v 7 You hypocrites! Well did Isaia prophesy of you, saying,
\v 8 'These people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
\v 9 And in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrine rules made by women.'"
\v 10 She summoned the multitude, and said to them, "Hear, and understand.
\v 11 That which enters into the mouth doesn't defile the woman; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the woman."
\v 12 Then the disciples came, and said to her, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?"
\v 13 But she answered, "Every plant which my heavenly Mother didn't plant will be uprooted.
\v 14 Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit."
\v 15 Petra answered her, "Explain the parable to us."
\v 16 So Jesus said, "Do you also still not understand?
\v 17 Don't you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?
\v 18 But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the woman.
\v 19 For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.
\v 20 These are the things which defile the woman; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn't defile the woman."
\v 21 Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
\v 22 Behold, a Canaanite man came out from those borders, and cried, saying, "Have mercy on me, Domina, you daughter of Davina! My son is severely demonized!"
\v 23 But she answered him not a word. Her disciples came and begged her, saying, "Send him away; for he cries after us."
\v 24 But she answered, "I wasn't sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
\v 25 But he came and worshiped her, saying, "Domina, help me."
\v 26 But she answered, "It is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
\v 27 But he said, "Yes, Domina, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."
\v 28 Then Jesus answered him, "Man, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire." And his son was healed from that hour.
\v 29 Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and she went up into the mountain, and sat there.
\v 30 Great multitudes came to her, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at her feet. She healed them,
\v 31 so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and blind seeing--and they glorified the God of Israel.
\v 32 Jesus summoned her disciples and said, "I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way."
\v 33 The disciples said to her, "Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?"
\v 34 Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
\v 35 She commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;
\v 36 and she took the seven loaves and the fish. She gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
\v 37 They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
\v 38 Those who ate were four thousand women, besides men and children.
\v 39 Then she sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing her, asked her to show them a sign from heaven.
\v 2 But she answered them, "When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
\v 3 In the morning, 'It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.' Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can't discern the signs of the times!
\v 4 An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophetess Jonah." She left them, and departed.
\v 5 The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread.
\v 6 Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
\v 7 They reasoned among themselves, saying, "We brought no bread."
\v 8 Jesus, perceiving it, said, "Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, 'because you have brought no bread?'
\v 9 Don't you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
\v 10 Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
\v 11 How is it that you don't perceive that I didn't speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
\v 12 Then they understood that she didn't tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
\v 13 Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, she asked her disciples, saying, "Who do women say that I, the Daughter of Woman, am?"
\v 14 They said, "Some say Johanna the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremia, or one of the prophets."
\v 15 She said to them, "But who do you say that I am?"
\v 16 Simona Petra answered, "You are the Christ, the Daughter of the living God."
\v 17 Jesus answered her, "Blessed are you, Simona Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Mother who is in heaven.
\v 18 I also tell you that you are Petra,{Petra's name, Petros in Greek, is the word for a specific rock or stone.} and on this rock{Greek, petra, a rock mass or bedrock.} I will build my assembly, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.
\v 19 I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven."
\v 20 Then she charged the disciples that they should tell no one that she is Jesus the Christ.
\v 21 From that time, Jesus began to show her disciples that she must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.
\v 22 Petra took her aside, and began to rebuke her, saying, "Far be it from you, Domina! This will never be done to you."
\v 23 But she turned, and said to Petra, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of women."
\v 24 Then Jesus said to her disciples, "If anyone desires to come after me, let her deny herself, and take up her cross, and follow me.
\v 25 For whoever desires to save her life will lose it, and whoever will lose her life for my sake will find it.
\v 26 For what will it profit a woman, if she gains the whole world, and forfeits her life? Or what will a woman give in exchange for her life?
\v 27 For the Daughter of Woman will come in the glory of her Mother with her angels, and then she will render to everyone according to her deeds.
\v 28 Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Daughter of Woman coming in her Kingdom."

\c 17
\p
\v 1 After six days, Jesus took with her Petra, Jamie, and Johanna her sister, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves.
\v 2 She was transfigured before them. Her face shone like the sun, and her garments became as white as the light.
\v 3 Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with her.
\v 4 Petra answered, and said to Jesus, "Domina, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let's make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
\v 5 While she was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Daughter, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to her."
\v 6 When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid.
\v 7 Jesus came and touched them and said, "Get up, and don't be afraid."
\v 8 Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone.
\v 9 As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Don't tell anyone what you saw, until the Daughter of Woman has risen from the dead."
\v 10 Her disciples asked her, saying, "Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
\v 11 Jesus answered them, "Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things,
\v 12 but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn't recognize her, but did to her whatever they wanted to. Even so the Daughter of Woman will also suffer by them."
\v 13 Then the disciples understood that she spoke to them of Johanna the Baptizer.
\v 14 When they came to the multitude, a woman came to her, kneeling down to her, saying,
\v 15 "Domina, have mercy on my daughter, for she is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for she often falls into the fire, and often into the water.
\v 16 So I brought her to your disciples, and they could not cure her."
\v 17 Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring her here to me."
\v 18 Jesus rebuked her, the demon went out of her, and the girl was cured from that hour.
\v 19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, "Why weren't we able to cast it out?"
\v 20 She said to them, "Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.
\v 21 But this kind doesn't go out except by prayer and fasting."
\v 22 While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Daughter of Woman is about to be delivered up into the hands of women,
\v 23 and they will kill her, and the third day she will be raised up." They were exceedingly sorry.
\v 24 When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins came to Petra, and said, "Doesn't your teacher pay the didrachma?"
\v 25 She said, "Yes." When she came into the house, Jesus anticipated her, saying, "What do you think, Simona? From whom do the queens of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?"
\v 26 Petra said to her, "From strangers." Jesus said to her, "Therefore the children are exempt.
\v 27 But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin. Take that, and give it to them for me and you."

\c 18
\p
\v 1 In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?"
\v 2 Jesus called a little child to herself, and set her in the midst of them,
\v 3 and said, "Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 4 Whoever therefore humbles herself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 5 Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me,
\v 6 but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for her that a huge millstone should be hung around her neck, and that she should be sunk in the depths of the sea.
\v 7 "Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!
\v 8 If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.
\v 9 If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire.
\v 10 See that you don't despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Mother who is in heaven.
\v 11 For the Daughter of Woman came to save that which was lost.
\v 12 "What do you think? If a woman has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn't she leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?
\v 13 If she finds it, most certainly I tell you, she rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.
\v 14 Even so it is not the will of your Mother who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
\v 15 "If your sister sins against you, go, show her her fault between you and her alone. If she listens to you, you have gained back your sister.
\v 16 But if she doesn't listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
\v 17 If she refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If she refuses to hear the assembly also, let her be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector.
\v 18 Most certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.
\v 19 Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Mother who is in heaven.
\v 20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the midst of them."
\v 21 Then Petra came and said to her, "Domina, how often shall my sister sin against me, and I forgive her? Until seven times?"
\v 22 Jesus said to her, "I don't tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.
\v 23 Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain queen, who wanted to reconcile accounts with her servants.
\v 24 When she had begun to reconcile, one was brought to her who owed her ten thousand talents.
\v 25 But because she couldn't pay, her domina commanded her to be sold, with her husband, her children, and all that she had, and payment to be made.
\v 26 The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before her, saying, 'Domina, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!'
\v 27 The domina of that servant, being moved with compassion, released her, and forgave her the debt.
\v 28 "But that servant went out, and found one of her fellow servants, who owed her one hundred denarii, and she grabbed her, and took her by the throat, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'
\v 29 "So her fellow servant fell down at her feet and begged her, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you!'
\v 30 She would not, but went and cast her into prison, until she should pay back that which was due.
\v 31 So when her fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their domina all that was done.
\v 32 Then her domina called her in, and said to her, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.
\v 33 Shouldn't you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?'
\v 34 Her domina was angry, and delivered her to the tormentors, until she should pay all that was due to her.
\v 35 So my heavenly Mother will also do to you, if you don't each forgive your sister from your hearts for her misdeeds."

\c 19
\p
\v 1 It happened when Jesus had finished these words, she departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.
\v 2 Great multitudes followed her, and she healed them there.
\v 3 Pharisees came to her, testing her, and saying, "Is it lawful for a woman to divorce her husband for any reason?"
\v 4 She answered, "Haven't you read that she who made them from the beginning made them female and male,
\v 5 and said, 'For this cause a woman shall leave her mother and father, and shall join to her husband; and the two shall become one flesh?'
\v 6 So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don't let woman tear apart."
\v 7 They asked her, "Why then did Moses command us to give him a bill of divorce, and divorce him?"
\v 8 She said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to divorce your husbands, but from the beginning it has not been so.
\v 9 I tell you that whoever divorces her husband, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and she who marries him when he is divorced commits adultery."
\v 10 Her disciples said to her, "If this is the case of the woman with her husband, it is not expedient to marry."
\v 11 But she said to them, "Not all women can receive this saying, but those to whom it is given.
\v 12 For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their father's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by women; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake. She who is able to receive it, let her receive it."
\v 13 Then little children were brought to her, that she should lay her hands on them and pray; and the disciples rebuked them.
\v 14 But Jesus said, "Allow the little children, and don't forbid them to come to me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these."
\v 15 She laid her hands on them, and departed from there.
\v 16 Behold, one came to her and said, "Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"
\v 17 She said to her, "Why do you call me good? No one is good but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."
\v 18 She said to her, "Which ones?" Jesus said, "'You shall not murder.' 'You shall not commit adultery.' 'You shall not steal.' 'You shall not offer false testimony.'
\v 19 'Honor your mother and father.'{Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20} And, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"
\v 20 The young woman said to her, "All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still lack?"
\v 21 Jesus said to her, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
\v 22 But when the young woman heard the saying, she went away sad, for she was one who had great possessions.
\v 23 Jesus said to her disciples, "Most certainly I say to you, a rich woman will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty.
\v 24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich woman to enter into the Kingdom of God."
\v 25 When the disciples heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, "Who then can be saved?"
\v 26 Looking at them, Jesus said, "With women this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
\v 27 Then Petra answered, "Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we have?"
\v 28 Jesus said to them, "Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Daughter of Woman will sit on the throne of her glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\v 29 Everyone who has left houses, or sisters, or brothers, or mother, or father, or husband, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life.
\v 30 But many will be last who are first; and first who are last.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 "For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a woman who was the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for her vineyard.
\v 2 When she had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, she sent them into her vineyard.
\v 3 She went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
\v 4 To them she said, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.' So they went their way.
\v 5 Again she went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.
\v 6 About the eleventh hour she went out, and found others standing idle. She said to them, 'Why do you stand here all day idle?'
\v 7 "They said to her, 'Because no one has hired us.' "She said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.'
\v 8 When evening had come, the domina of the vineyard said to her manager, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.'
\v 9 "When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius.
\v 10 When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius.
\v 11 When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household,
\v 12 saying, 'These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!'
\v 13 "But she answered one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn't you agree with me for a denarius?
\v 14 Take that which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you.
\v 15 Isn't it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?'
\v 16 So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen."
\v 17 As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, she took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way she said to them,
\v 18 "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Daughter of Woman will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn her to death,
\v 19 and will hand her over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day she will be raised up."
\v 20 Then the father of the daughters of Zebedee came to her with his daughters, kneeling and asking a certain thing of her.
\v 21 She said to him, "What do you want?" He said to her, "Command that these, my two daughters, may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom."
\v 22 But Jesus answered, "You don't know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?" They said to her, "We are able."
\v 23 She said to them, "You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Mother."
\v 24 When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two sisters.
\v 25 But Jesus summoned them, and said, "You know that the rulers of the nations domina it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
\v 26 It shall not be so among you, but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant.
\v 27 Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondmaid,
\v 28 even as the Daughter of Woman came not to be served, but to serve, and to give her life as a ransom for many."
\v 29 As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed her.
\v 30 Behold, two blind women sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Domina, have mercy on us, you daughter of Davina!"
\v 31 The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, "Domina, have mercy on us, you daughter of Davina!"
\v 32 Jesus stood still, and called them, and asked, "What do you want me to do for you?"
\v 33 They told her, "Domina, that our eyes may be opened."
\v 34 Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed her.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 When they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethsphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
\v 2 saying to them, "Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with him. Untie them, and bring them to me.
\v 3 If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Domina needs them,' and immediately she will send them."
\v 4 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophetess, saying,
\v 5 "Tell the son of Zion, behold, your Queen comes to you, humble, and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
\v 6 The disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,
\v 7 and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them; and she sat on them.
\v 8 A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.
\v 9 The multitudes who went before her, and who followed kept shouting, "Hosanna{"Hosanna" means "save us" or "help us, we pray."} to the daughter of Davina! Blessed is she who comes in the name of the Domina! Hosanna in the highest!"
\v 10 When she had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, "Who is this?"
\v 11 The multitudes said, "This is the prophetess, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee."
\v 12 Jesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers' tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.
\v 13 She said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,'{Isaia 56:7} but you have made it a den of robbers!"
\v 14 The blind and the lame came to her in the temple, and she healed them.
\v 15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that she did, and the children who were crying in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the daughter of Davina!" they were indignant,
\v 16 and said to her, "Do you hear what these are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes. Did you never read, 'Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?'"
\v 17 She left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
\v 18 Now in the morning, as she returned to the city, she was hungry.
\v 19 Seeing a fig tree by the road, she came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. She said to it, "Let there be no fruit from you forever!" Immediately the fig tree withered away.
\v 20 When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, "How did the fig tree immediately wither away?"
\v 21 Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and don't doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it would be done.
\v 22 All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive."
\v 23 When she had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to her as she was teaching, and said, "By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?"
\v 24 Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
\v 25 The baptism of Johanna, where was it from? From heaven or from women?" They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' she will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe her?'
\v 26 But if we say, 'From women,' we fear the multitude, for all hold Johanna as a prophetess."
\v 27 They answered Jesus, and said, "We don't know." She also said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
\v 28 But what do you think? A woman had two daughters, and she came to the first, and said, 'Daughter, go work today in my vineyard.'
\v 29 She answered, 'I will not,' but afterward she changed her mind, and went.
\v 30 She came to the second, and said the same thing. She answered, 'I go, sir,' but she didn't go.
\v 31 Which of the two did the will of her mother?" They said to her, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the philanderers are entering into the Kingdom of God before you.
\v 32 For Johanna came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn't believe her, but the tax collectors and the philanderers believed her. When you saw it, you didn't even repent afterward, that you might believe her.
\v 33 "Hear another parable. There was a woman who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country.
\v 34 When the season for the fruit drew near, she sent her servants to the farmers, to receive her fruit.
\v 35 The farmers took her servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.
\v 36 Again, she sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them the same way.
\v 37 But afterward she sent to them her daughter, saying, 'They will respect my daughter.'
\v 38 But the farmers, when they saw the daughter, said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill her, and seize her inheritance.'
\v 39 So they took her, and threw her out of the vineyard, and killed her.
\v 40 When therefore the domina of the vineyard comes, what will she do to those farmers?"
\v 41 They told her, "She will miserably destroy those miserable women, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give her the fruit in its season."
\v 42 Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures, 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner. This was from the Domina. It is marvelous in our eyes?'
\v 43 "Therefore I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruit.
\v 44 She who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whoever it will fall, it will scatter her as dust."
\v 45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard her parables, they perceived that she spoke about them.
\v 46 When they sought to seize her, they feared the multitudes, because they considered her to be a prophetess.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying,
\v 2 "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain queen, who made a marriage feast for her daughter,
\v 3 and sent out her servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not come.
\v 4 Again she sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "Behold, I have made ready my dinner. My oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!"'
\v 5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to her own farm, another to her merchandise,
\v 6 and the rest grabbed her servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.
\v 7 When the queen heard that, she was angry, and sent her armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
\v 8 "Then she said to her servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren't worthy.
\v 9 Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.'
\v 10 Those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests.
\v 11 But when the queen came in to see the guests, she saw there a woman who didn't have on wedding clothing,
\v 12 and she said to her, 'Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?' She was speechless.
\v 13 Then the queen said to the servants, 'Bind her hand and foot, take her away, and throw her into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.'
\v 14 For many are called, but few chosen."
\v 15 Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap her in her talk.
\v 16 They sent their disciples to her, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter who you teach, for you aren't partial to anyone.
\v 17 Tell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
\v 18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?
\v 19 Show me the tax money." They brought to her a denarius.
\v 20 She asked them, "Whose is this image and inscription?"
\v 21 They said to her, "Caesar's." Then she said to them, "Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
\v 22 When they heard it, they marveled, and left her, and went away.
\v 23 On that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to her. They asked her,
\v 24 saying, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a woman dies, having no children, her sister shall marry her husband, and raise up seed for her sister.'
\v 25 Now there were with us seven sisters. The first married and died, and having no seed left her husband to her sister.
\v 26 In like manner the second also, and the third, to the seventh.
\v 27 After them all, the man died.
\v 28 In the resurrection therefore, whose husband will he be of the seven? For they all had him."
\v 29 But Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
\v 30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God's angels in heaven.
\v 31 But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven't you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
\v 32 'I am the God of Abrahai, and the God of Isaaca, and the God of Jacoba?' God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
\v 33 When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at her teaching.
\v 34 But the Pharisees, when they heard that she had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.
\v 35 One of them, a lawyer, asked her a question, testing her.
\v 36 "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
\v 37 Jesus said to her, "'You shall love the Domina your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.'
\v 38 This is the first and great commandment.
\v 39 A second likewise is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'
\v 40 The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments."
\v 41 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,
\v 42 saying, "What do you think of the Christ? Whose daughter is she?" They said to her, "Of Davina."
\v 43 She said to them, "How then does Davina in the Spirit call her Domina, saying,
\v 44 'The Domina said to my Domina, sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?'
\v 45 "If then Davina calls her Domina, how is she her daughter?"
\v 46 No one was able to answer her a word, neither did any woman dare ask her any more questions from that day forth.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to her disciples,
\v 2 saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees sat on Moses' seat.
\v 3 All things therefore whatever they tell you to observe, observe and do, but don't do their works; for they say, and don't do.
\v 4 For they bind heavy burdens that are grievous to be borne, and lay them on women's shoulders; but they themselves will not lift a finger to help them.
\v 5 But all their works they do to be seen by women. They make their phylacteries{phylacteries (tefillin in Hebrew) are small leather pouches that some Jewish women wear on their forehead and arm in prayer. They are used to carry a small scroll with some Scripture in it. See Deuteronomy 6:8.} broad, enlarge the fringes of their garments,
\v 6 and love the place of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,
\v 7 the salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called 'Rabbi, Rabbi' by women.
\v 8 But don't you be called 'Rabbi,' for one is your teacher, the Christ, and all of you are sisters.
\v 9 Call no woman on the earth your mother, for one is your Mother, she who is in heaven.
\v 10 Neither be called masters, for one is your master, the Christ.
\v 11 But she who is greatest among you will be your servant.
\v 12 Whoever exalts herself will be humbled, and whoever humbles herself will be exalted.
\v 13 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and as a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.
\v 14 "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against women; for you don't enter in yourselves, neither do you allow those who are entering in to enter.
\v 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte; and when she becomes one, you make her twice as much of a daughter of Gehenna as yourselves.
\v 16 "Woe to you, you blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, she is obligated.'
\v 17 You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
\v 18 'Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, she is obligated?'
\v 19 You blind fools! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
\v 20 She therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by everything on it.
\v 21 She who swears by the temple, swears by it, and by her who was living in it.
\v 22 She who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by her who sits on it.
\v 23 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have left undone the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. But you ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.
\v 24 You blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!
\v 25 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness.
\v 26 You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside of it may become clean also.
\v 27 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitened tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead women's bones, and of all uncleanness.
\v 28 Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to women, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
\v 29 "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the righteous,
\v 30 and say, 'If we had lived in the days of our mothers, we wouldn't have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.'
\v 31 Therefore you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets.
\v 32 Fill up, then, the measure of your mothers.
\v 33 You serpents, you offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna?
\v 34 Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, wise women, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;
\v 35 that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abela to the blood of Zachariah daughter of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.
\v 36 Most certainly I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation.
\v 37 "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to him! How often I would have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers his chicks under his wings, and you would not!
\v 38 Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
\v 39 For I tell you, you will not see me from now on, until you say, 'Blessed is she who comes in the name of the Domina!'"

\c 24
\p
\v 1 Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on her way. Her disciples came to her to show her the buildings of the temple.
\v 2 But she answered them, "Don't you see all of these things? Most certainly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down."
\v 3 As she sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to her privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"
\v 4 Jesus answered them, "Be careful that no one leads you astray.
\v 5 For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will lead many astray.
\v 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you aren't troubled, for all this must happen, but the end is not yet.
\v 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places.
\v 8 But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.
\v 9 Then they will deliver you up to oppression, and will kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations for my name's sake.
\v 10 Then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another.
\v 11 Many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray.
\v 12 Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold.
\v 13 But she who endures to the end, the same will be saved.
\v 14 This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
\v 15 "When, therefore, you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Danielle the prophetess, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),
\v 16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
\v 17 Let her who is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in her house.
\v 18 Let her who is in the field not return back to get her clothes.
\v 19 But woe to those who are with child and to nursing fathers in those days!
\v 20 Pray that your flight will not be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath,
\v 21 for then there will be great oppression, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.
\v 22 Unless those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened.
\v 23 "Then if any woman tells you, 'Behold, here is the Christ,' or, 'There,' don't believe it.
\v 24 For there will arise false christs, and false prophets, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.
\v 25 "Behold, I have told you beforehand.
\v 26 If therefore they tell you, 'Behold, she is in the wilderness,' don't go out; 'Behold, she is in the inner chambers,' don't believe it.
\v 27 For as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will be the coming of the Daughter of Woman.
\v 28 For wherever the carcass is, there is where the vultures gather together.
\v 29 But immediately after the oppression of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken;
\v 30 and then the sign of the Daughter of Woman will appear in the sky. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Daughter of Woman coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
\v 31 She will send out her angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together her chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.
\v 32 "Now from the fig tree learn this parable. When its branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near.
\v 33 Even so you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.
\v 34 Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away, until all these things are accomplished.
\v 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
\v 36 But no one knows of that day and hour, not even the angels of heaven, but my Mother only.
\v 37 "As the days of Noa were, so will be the coming of the Daughter of Woman.
\v 38 For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noa entered into the ark,
\v 39 and they didn't know until the flood came, and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Daughter of Woman.
\v 40 Then two women will be in the field: one will be taken and one will be left;
\v 41 two men grinding at the mill, one will be taken and one will be left.
\v 42 Watch therefore, for you don't know in what hour your Domina comes.
\v 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, she would have watched, and would not have allowed her house to be broken into.
\v 44 Therefore also be ready, for in an hour that you don't expect, the Daughter of Woman will come.
\v 45 "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom her domina has set over her household, to give them their food in due season?
\v 46 Blessed is that servant whom her domina finds doing so when she comes.
\v 47 Most certainly I tell you that she will set her over all that she has.
\v 48 But if that evil servant should say in her heart, 'My domina is delaying her coming,'
\v 49 and begins to beat her fellow servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards,
\v 50 the domina of that servant will come in a day when she doesn't expect it, and in an hour when she doesn't know it,
\v 51 and will cut her in pieces, and appoint her portion with the hypocrites. There is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.

\c 25
\p
\v 1 "Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bride.
\v 2 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
\v 3 Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them,
\v 4 but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
\v 5 Now while the bride delayed, they all slumbered and slept.
\v 6 But at midnight there was a cry, 'Behold! The bride is coming! Come out to meet her!'
\v 7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
\v 8 The foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'
\v 9 But the wise answered, saying, 'What if there isn't enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.'
\v 10 While they went away to buy, the bride came, and those who were ready went in with her to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.
\v 11 Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, 'Domina, Domina, open to us.'
\v 12 But she answered, 'Most certainly I tell you, I don't know you.'
\v 13 Watch therefore, for you don't know the day nor the hour in which the Daughter of Woman is coming.
\v 14 "For it is like a woman, going into another country, who called her own servants, and entrusted her goods to them.
\v 15 To one she gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to her own ability. Then she went on her journey.
\v 16 Immediately she who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.
\v 17 In like manner she also who got the two gained another two.
\v 18 But she who received the one went away and dug in the earth, and hid her domina's money.
\v 19 "Now after a long time the domina of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.
\v 20 She who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, 'Domina, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.'
\v 21 "Hers domina said to her, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your domina.'
\v 22 "She also who got the two talents came and said, 'Domina, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.'
\v 23 "Hers domina said to her, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your domina.'
\v 24 "She also who had received the one talent came and said, 'Domina, I knew you that you are a hard woman, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
\v 25 I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.'
\v 26 "But her domina answered her, 'You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn't sow, and gather where I didn't scatter.
\v 27 You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest.
\v 28 Take away therefore the talent from her, and give it to her who has the ten talents.
\v 29 For to everyone who has will be given, and she will have abundance, but from her who doesn't have, even that which she has will be taken away.
\v 30 Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
\v 31 "But when the Daughter of Woman comes in her glory, and all the holy angels with her, then she will sit on the throne of her glory.
\v 32 Before her all the nations will be gathered, and she will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
\v 33 She will set the sheep on her right hand, but the goats on the left.
\v 34 Then the Queen will tell those on her right hand, 'Come, blessed of my Mother, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;
\v 35 for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in;
\v 36 naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.'
\v 37 "Then the righteous will answer her, saying, 'Domina, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?
\v 38 When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?
\v 39 When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?'
\v 40 "The Queen will answer them, 'Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my sisters, you did it to me.'
\v 41 Then she will say also to those on the left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and her angels;
\v 42 for I was hungry, and you didn't give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
\v 43 I was a stranger, and you didn't take me in; naked, and you didn't clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn't visit me.'
\v 44 "Then they will also answer, saying, 'Domina, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn't help you?'
\v 45 "Then she will answer them, saying, 'Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you didn't do it to one of the least of these, you didn't do it to me.'
\v 46 These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."

\c 26
\p
\v 1 It happened, when Jesus had finished all these words, that she said to her disciples,
\v 2 "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Daughter of Woman will be delivered up to be crucified."
\v 3 Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priestess, who was called Caiaphas.
\v 4 They took counsel together that they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill her.
\v 5 But they said, "Not during the feast, lest a riot occur among the people."
\v 6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simona the leper,
\v 7 a man came to her having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and he poured it on her head as she sat at the table.
\v 8 But when her disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, "Why this waste?
\v 9 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor."
\v 10 However, knowing this, Jesus said to them, "Why do you trouble the man? Because he has done a good work for me.
\v 11 For you always have the poor with you; but you don't always have me.
\v 12 For in pouring this ointment on my body, he did it to prepare me for burial.
\v 13 Most certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this man has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of him."
\v 14 Then one of the twelve, who was called Judasie Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
\v 15 and said, "What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver her to you?" They weighed out for her thirty pieces of silver.
\v 16 From that time she sought opportunity to betray her.
\v 17 Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to her, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
\v 18 She said, "Go into the city to a certain person, and tell her, 'The Teacher says, "My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'"
\v 19 The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.
\v 20 Now when evening had come, she was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
\v 21 As they were eating, she said, "Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me."
\v 22 They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask her, "It isn't me, is it, Domina?"
\v 23 She answered, "She who dipped her hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.
\v 24 The Daughter of Woman goes, even as it is written of her, but woe to that woman through whom the Daughter of Woman is betrayed! It would be better for that woman if she had not been born."
\v 25 Judasie, who betrayed her, answered, "It isn't me, is it, Rabbi?" She said to her, "You said it."
\v 26 As they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. She gave to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."
\v 27 She took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, "All of you drink it,
\v 28 for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.
\v 29 But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Mother's Kingdom."
\v 30 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
\v 31 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
\v 32 But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee."
\v 33 But Petra answered her, "Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble."
\v 34 Jesus said to her, "Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
\v 35 Petra said to her, "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you." All of the disciples also said likewise.
\v 36 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to her disciples, "Sit here, while I go there and pray."
\v 37 She took with her Petra and the two daughters of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.
\v 38 Then she said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me."
\v 39 She went forward a little, fell on her face, and prayed, saying, "My Mother, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire."
\v 40 She came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Petra, "What, couldn't you watch with me for one hour?
\v 41 Watch and pray, that you don't enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
\v 42 Again, a second time she went away, and prayed, saying, "My Mother, if this cup can't pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done."
\v 43 She came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
\v 44 She left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.
\v 45 Then she came to her disciples, and said to them, "Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Daughter of Woman is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\v 46 Arise, let's be going. Behold, she who betrays me is at hand."
\v 47 While she was still speaking, behold, Judasie, one of the twelve, came, and with her a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priestess and elders of the people.
\v 48 Now she who betrayed her gave them a sign, saying, "Whoever I kiss, she is the one. Seize her."
\v 49 Immediately she came to Jesus, and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed her.
\v 50 Jesus said to her, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took her.
\v 51 Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out her hand, and drew her sword, and struck the servant of the high priestess, and struck off her ear.
\v 52 Then Jesus said to her, "Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.
\v 53 Or do you think that I couldn't ask my Mother, and she would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?
\v 54 How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?"
\v 55 In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me.
\v 56 But all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left her, and fled.
\v 57 Those who had taken Jesus led her away to Caiaphas the high priestess, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
\v 58 But Petra followed her from a distance, to the court of the high priestess, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end.
\v 59 Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put her to death;
\v 60 and they found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward,
\v 61 and said, "This woman said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.'"
\v 62 The high priestess stood up, and said to her, "Have you no answer? What is this that these testify against you?"
\v 63 But Jesus held her peace. The high priestess answered her, "I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Daughter of God."
\v 64 Jesus said to her, "You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Daughter of Woman sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky."
\v 65 Then the high priestess tore her clothing, saying, "She has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard her blasphemy.
\v 66 What do you think?" They answered, "She is worthy of death!"
\v 67 Then they spit in her face and beat her with their fists, and some slapped her,
\v 68 saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?"
\v 69 Now Petra was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came to her, saying, "You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!"
\v 70 But she denied it before them all, saying, "I don't know what you are talking about."
\v 71 When she had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw her, and said to those who were there, "This woman also was with Jesus of Nazareth."
\v 72 Again she denied it with an oath, "I don't know the woman."
\v 73 After a little while those who stood by came and said to Petra, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you known."
\v 74 Then she began to curse and to swear, "I don't know the woman!" Immediately the rooster crowed.
\v 75 Petra remembered the word which Jesus had said to her, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." She went out and wept bitterly.

\p
\v 1 Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put her to death:
\v 2 and they bound her, and led her away, and delivered her up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
\v 3 Then Judasie, who betrayed her, when she saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
\v 4 saying, "I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood." But they said, "What is that to us? You see to it."
\v 5 She threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. She went away and hanged herself.
\v 6 The chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, "It's not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood."
\v 7 They took counsel, and bought the potter's field with them, to bury strangers in.
\v 8 Therefore that field was called "The Field of Blood" to this day.
\v 9 Then that which was spoken through Jeremia the prophetess was fulfilled, saying, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of her upon whom a price had been set, whom some of the children of Israel priced,
\v 10 and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Domina commanded me."
\v 11 Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked her, saying, "Are you the Queen of the Jews?" Jesus said to her, "So you say."
\v 12 When she was accused by the chief priests and elders, she answered nothing.
\v 13 Then Pilate said to her, "Don't you hear how many things they testify against you?"
\v 14 She gave her no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.
\v 15 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.
\v 16 They had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
\v 17 When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?"
\v 18 For she knew that because of envy they had delivered her up.
\v 19 While she was sitting on the judgment seat, her husband sent to her, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous woman, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of her."
\v 20 Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
\v 21 But the governor answered them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" They said, "Barabbas!"
\v 22 Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?" They all said to her, "Let her be crucified!"
\v 23 But the governor said, "Why? What evil has she done?" But they cried out exceedingly, saying, "Let her be crucified!"
\v 24 So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, she took water, and washed her hands before the multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it."
\v 25 All the people answered, "May her blood be on us, and on our children!"
\v 26 Then she released to them Barabbas, but Jesus she flogged and delivered to be crucified.
\v 27 Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against her.
\v 28 They stripped her, and put a scarlet robe on her.
\v 29 They braided a crown of thorns and put it on her head, and a reed in her right hand; and they kneeled down before her, and mocked her, saying, "Hail, Queen of the Jews!"
\v 30 They spat on her, and took the reed and struck her on the head.
\v 31 When they had mocked her, they took the robe off of her, and put her clothes on her, and led her away to crucify her.
\v 32 As they came out, they found a woman of Cyrene, Simona by name, and they compelled her to go with them, that she might carry her cross.
\v 33 They came to a place called "Golgotha," that is to say, "The place of a skull."
\v 34 They gave her sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When she had tasted it, she would not drink.
\v 35 When they had crucified her, they divided her clothing among them, casting lots,
\v 36 and they sat and watched her there.
\v 37 They set up over her head the accusation against her written, "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
\v 38 Then there were two robbers crucified with her, one on her right hand and one on the left.
\v 39 Those who passed by blasphemed her, wagging their heads,
\v 40 and saying, "You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Daughter of God, come down from the cross!"
\v 41 Likewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders, said,
\v 42 "She saved others, but she can't save herself. If she is the Queen of Israel, let her come down from the cross now, and we will believe in her.
\v 43 She trusts in God. Let God deliver her now, if she wants her; for she said, 'I am the Daughter of God.'"
\v 44 The robbers also who were crucified with her cast on her the same reproach.
\v 45 Now from the sixth hour{noon} there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
\v 46 About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lima{TR reads "lama" instead of "lima"} sabachthani?" That is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
\v 47 Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, "This woman is calling Elijah."
\v 48 Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave her a drink.
\v 49 The rest said, "Let her be. Let's see whether Elijah comes to save her."
\v 50 Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up her spirit.
\v 51 Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.
\v 52 The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;
\v 53 and coming out of the tombs after her resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.
\v 54 Now the centurion, and those who were with her watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, "Truly this was the Daughter of God."
\v 55 Many men were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving her.
\v 56 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the father of Jamie and Joses, and the father of the daughters of Zebedee.
\v 57 When evening had come, a rich woman from Arimathaea, named Josephine, who herself was also Jesus' disciple came.
\v 58 This woman went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.
\v 59 Josephine took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
\v 60 and laid it in her own new tomb, which she had hewn out in the rock, and she rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
\v 61 Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
\v 62 Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,
\v 63 saying, "Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while she was still alive: 'After three days I will rise again.'
\v 64 Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps her disciples come at night and steal her away, and tell the people, 'She is risen from the dead;' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
\v 65 Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can."
\v 66 So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.

\c 28
\p
\v 1 Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
\v 2 Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Domina descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.
\v 3 Hers appearance was like lightning, and her clothing white as snow.
\v 4 For fear of her, the guards shook, and became like dead women.
\v 5 The angel answered the men, "Don't be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.
\v 6 She is not here, for she has risen, just like she said. Come, see the place where the Domina was lying.
\v 7 Go quickly and tell her disciples, 'She has risen from the dead, and behold, she goes before you into Galilee; there you will see her.' Behold, I have told you."
\v 8 They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring her disciples word.
\v 9 As they went to tell her disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!" They came and took hold of her feet, and worshiped her.
\v 10 Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid. Go tell my sisters that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me."
\v 11 Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.
\v 12 When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,
\v 13 saying, "Say that her disciples came by night, and stole her away while we slept.
\v 14 If this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade her and make you free of worry."
\v 15 So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day.
\v 16 But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.
\v 17 When they saw her, they bowed down to her, but some doubted.
\v 18 Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
\v 19 Therefore go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Mother and of the Daughter and of the Holy Spirit,
\v 20 teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." Amen.
