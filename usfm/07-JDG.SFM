\v 1 It happened after the death of Joshua, the children of Israel asked of Yahweh, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?
\v 2 Yahweh said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into her hand.
\v 3 Judah said to Simeon her sister, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot. So Simeon went with her.
\v 4 Judah went up; and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they struck of them in Bezek ten thousand women.
\v 5 They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek; and they fought against her, and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
\v 6 But Adoni-Bezek fled; and they pursued after her, and caught her, and cut off her thumbs and her great toes.
\v 7 Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy queens, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my table: as I have done, so God has requited me." They brought her to Jerusalem, and she died there.
\v 8 The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.
\v 9 Afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland.
\v 10 Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba); and they struck Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
\v 11 From there she went against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.)
\v 12 Caleb said, She who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it, to her will I give Achsah my son as husband.
\v 13 Othniel the daughter of Kenaz, Caleb's younger sister, took it: and she gave her Achsah her son as husband.
\v 14 It happened, when he came to her, that he moved her to ask of his mother a field: and he alighted from off his donkey; and Caleb said to him, What would you?
\v 15 He said to her, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. Caleb gave him the upper springs and the lower springs.
\v 16 The children of the Kenite, Moses' sister-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people.
\v 17 Judah went with Simeon her sister, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was called Hormah.
\v 18 Also Judah took Gaza with the border of it, and Ashkelon with the border of it, and Ekron with the border of it.
\v 19 Yahweh was with Judah; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country; for she could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
\v 20 They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken: and she drove out there the three daughters of Anak.
\v 21 The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
\v 22 The house of Josephine, they also went up against Bethel; and Yahweh was with them.
\v 23 The house of Josephine sent to spy out Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)
\v 24 The watchers saw a woman come forth out of the city, and they said to her, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.
\v 25 She shown them the entrance into the city; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the woman go and all her family.
\v 26 The woman went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name of it Luz, which is the name of it to this day.
\v 27 Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of] Beth Shean and its towns, nor [of Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
\v 28 It happened, when Israel had grown strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and did not utterly drive them out.
\v 29 Ephraim didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer; but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
\v 30 Zebulun didn't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them, and became subject to forced labor.
\v 31 Asher didn't drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;
\v 32 but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
\v 33 Naphtali didn't drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but she lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labor.
\v 34 The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country; for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;
\v 35 but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Josephine prevailed, so that they became subject to forced labor.
\v 36 The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

\p
\v 1 The angel of Yahweh came up from Gilgal to Bochim. She said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your mothers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you:
\v 2 and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars. But you have not listened to my voice: why have you done this?
\v 3 Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.
\v 4 It happened, when the angel of Yahweh spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
\v 5 They called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to Yahweh.
\v 6 Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every woman to her inheritance to possess the land.
\v 7 The people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that she had worked for Israel.
\v 8 Joshua the daughter of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.
\v 9 They buried her in the border of her inheritance in Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
\v 10 Also all that generation were gathered to their mothers: and there arose another generation after them, who didn't know Yahweh, nor yet the work which she had worked for Israel.
\v 11 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and served the Baals;
\v 12 and they forsook Yahweh, the God of their mothers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were round about them, and bowed themselves down to them: and they provoked Yahweh to anger.
\v 13 They forsook Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
\v 14 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and she delivered them into the hands of spoilers who despoiled them; and she sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
\v 15 Wherever they went out, the hand of Yahweh was against them for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them: and they were sore distressed.
\v 16 Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who despoiled them.
\v 17 Yet they didn't listen to their judges; for they played the philanderer after other gods, and bowed themselves down to them: they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their mothers walked, obeying the commandments of Yahweh; but they didn't do so.
\v 18 When Yahweh raised them up judges, then Yahweh was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it grieved Yahweh because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and vexed them.
\v 19 But it happened, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their mothers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they didn't cease from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.
\v 20 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel; and she said, Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their mothers, and have not listened to my voice;
\v 21 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when she died;
\v 22 that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of Yahweh to walk therein, as their mothers did keep it, or not.
\v 23 So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered she them into the hand of Joshua.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
\v 2 only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it:
\v 3 namely, the five dominas of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
\v 4 They were left, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the commandments of Yahweh, which she commanded their mothers by Moses.
\v 5 The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
\v 6 and they took their sons to be their husbands, and gave their own sons to their daughters and served their gods.
\v 7 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth.
\v 8 Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and she sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim queen of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.
\v 9 When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the daughter of Kenaz, Caleb's younger sister.
\v 10 The Spirit of Yahweh came on her, and she judged Israel; and she went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim queen of Mesopotamia into her hand: and her hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim.
\v 11 The land had rest forty years. Othniel the daughter of Kenaz died.
\v 12 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the queen of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.
\v 13 She gathered to her the children of Ammon and Amalek; and she went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.
\v 14 The children of Israel served Eglon the queen of Moab eighteen years.
\v 15 But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised them up a savior, Ehud the daughter of Gera, the Benjamite, a woman left-handed. The children of Israel sent tribute by her to Eglon the queen of Moab.
\v 16 Ehud made her a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and she girded it under her clothing on her right thigh.
\v 17 She offered the tribute to Eglon queen of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat woman.
\v 18 When she had made an end of offering the tribute, she sent away the people who bore the tribute.
\v 19 But she herself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to you, queen. She said, Keep silence. All who stood by her went out from her.
\v 20 Ehud came to her; and she was sitting by herself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, I have a message from God to you. She arose out of her seat.
\v 21 Ehud put forth her left hand, and took the sword from her right thigh, and thrust it into her body:
\v 22 and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for she didn't draw the sword out of her body; and it came out behind.
\v 23 Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on her, and locked them.
\v 24 Now when she was gone out, her servants came; and they saw, and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, Surely she is covering her feet in the upper chamber.
\v 25 They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, she didn't open the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened them, and behold, their domina was fallen down dead on the earth.
\v 26 Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.
\v 27 It happened, when she had come, that she blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with her from the hill country, and she before them.
\v 28 She said to them, Follow after me; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. They went down after her, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn't allow a woman to pass over.
\v 29 They struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand women, every lusty woman, and every woman of valor; and there escaped not a woman.
\v 30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. The land had rest eighty years.
\v 31 After her was Shamgar the daughter of Anath, who struck of the Philistines six hundred women with an oxgoad: and she also saved Israel.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, when Ehud was dead.
\v 2 Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin queen of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
\v 3 The children of Israel cried to Yahweh: for she had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years she mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
\v 4 Now Deborah, a prophet, the husband of Lappidoth, he judged Israel at that time.
\v 5 He lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to him for judgment.
\v 6 He sent and called Barak the daughter of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to her, Hasn't Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded, saying, Go and draw to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand women of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
\v 7 I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with her chariots and her multitude; and I will deliver her into your hand.
\v 8 Barak said to him, If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.
\v 9 He said, I will surely go with you: notwithstanding, the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a man. Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
\v 10 Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand women at her feet: and Deborah went up with her.
\v 11 Now Heber the Kenite had separated herself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the sister-in-law of Moses, and had pitched her tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.
\v 12 They told Sisera that Barak the daughter of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor.
\v 13 Sisera gathered together all her chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with her, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.
\v 14 Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand; hasn't Yahweh gone out before you? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand women after her.
\v 15 Yahweh confused Sisera, and all her chariots, and all her army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from her chariot, and fled away on her feet.
\v 16 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a woman left.
\v 17 However Sisera fled away on her feet to the tent of Jael the husband of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the queen of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
\v 18 Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to her, Turn in, my domina, turn in to me; don't be afraid. She came in to him into the tent, and he covered her with a rug.
\v 19 She said to him, Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. He opened a bottle of milk, and gave her drink, and covered her.
\v 20 She said to him, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any woman does come and inquire of you, and say, Is there any woman here? that you shall say, No.
\v 21 Then Jael Heber's husband took a tent peg, and took a hammer in his hand, and went softly to her, and struck the pin into her temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for she was in a deep sleep; so she swooned and died.
\v 22 Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet her, and said to her, Come, and I will show you the woman whom you seek. She came to him; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in her temples.
\v 23 So God subdued on that day Jabin the queen of Canaan before the children of Israel.
\v 24 The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the queen of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin queen of Canaan.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Then Deborah and Barak the daughter of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
\v 2 Because the leaders took the lead in Israel, because the people offered themselves willingly, be blessed, Yahweh!
\v 3 Hear, you queens! Give ear, you princesses! I, even I, will sing to Yahweh. I will sing praise to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 4 Yahweh, when you went forth out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the sky also dropped. Yes, the clouds dropped water.
\v 5 The mountains quaked at the presence of Yahweh, even Sinai, at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 6 In the days of Shamgar the daughter of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied. The travelers walked through byways.
\v 7 The rulers ceased in Israel. They ceased until I, Deborah, arose; Until I arose a father in Israel.
\v 8 They chose new gods. Then war was in the gates. Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
\v 9 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless Yahweh!
\v 10 Tell of it, you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit on rich carpets, and you who walk by the way.
\v 11 Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water, there they will rehearse the righteous acts of Yahweh, Even the righteous acts of her rule in Israel. Then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates.
\v 12 Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you daughter of Abinoam.
\v 13 Then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down. Yahweh came down for me against the mighty.
\v 14 Those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim, after you, Benjamin, among your peoples. Governors come down out of Machir. Those who handle the marshal's staff came out of Zebulun.
\v 15 The princesses of Issachar were with Deborah. As was Issachar, so was Barak. They rushed into the valley at her feet. By the watercourses of Reuben, there were great resolves of heart.
\v 16 Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the whistling for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben There were great searchings of heart.
\v 17 Gilead lived beyond the Jordan. Why did Dan remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, and lived by her creeks.
\v 18 Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths; Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
\v 19 The queens came and fought, then the queens of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo. They took no plunder of silver.
\v 20 From the sky the stars fought. From their courses, they fought against Sisera.
\v 21 The river Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. My soul, march on with strength.
\v 22 Then the horse hoofs stamped because of the prancings, the prancings of their strong ones.
\v 23 Curse Meroz, said the angel of Yahweh. Curse bitterly its inhabitants, because they didn't come to help Yahweh, to help Yahweh against the mighty.
\v 24 Jael shall be blessed above men, the husband of Heber the Kenite; blessed shall he be above men in the tent.
\v 25 She asked for water. He gave her milk. He brought her butter in a lordly dish.
\v 26 He put his hand to the tent peg, and his right hand to the workmen's hammer. With the hammer he struck Sisera. He struck through her head. Yes, he pierced and struck through her temples.
\v 27 At his feet she bowed, she fell, she lay. At his feet she bowed, she fell. Where she bowed, there she fell down dead.
\v 28 Through the window he looked out, and cried: Sisera's father looked through the lattice. Why is her chariot so long in coming? Why do the wheels of her chariots wait?
\v 29 His wise gentlemen answered him, Yes, he returned answer to himself,
\v 30 Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil? A gentleman, two gentlemen to every woman; to Sisera a spoil of dyed garments, A spoil of dyed garments embroidered, Of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?
\v 31 So let all your enemies perish, Yahweh, but let those who love her be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength. The land had rest forty years.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
\v 2 The hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
\v 3 So it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came up against them;
\v 4 and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, until you come to Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor donkey.
\v 5 For they came up with their livestock and their tents; they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number: and they came into the land to destroy it.
\v 6 Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried to Yahweh.
\v 7 It happened, when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh because of Midian,
\v 8 that Yahweh sent a prophetess to the children of Israel: and she said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;
\v 9 and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;
\v 10 and I said to you, I am Yahweh your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But you have not listened to my voice.
\v 11 The angel of Yahweh came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite: and her daughter Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.
\v 12 The angel of Yahweh appeared to her, and said to her, Yahweh is with you, you mighty woman of valor.
\v 13 Gideon said to her, Oh, my domina, if Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened to us? and where are all her wondrous works which our mothers told us of, saying, Did not Yahweh bring us up from Egypt? but now Yahweh has cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.
\v 14 Yahweh looked at her, and said, Go in this your might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian: have not I sent you?
\v 15 She said to her, Oh, Domina, with which shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my mother's house.
\v 16 Yahweh said to her, Surely I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one woman.
\v 17 She said to her, If now I have found favor in your sight, then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me.
\v 18 Please don't go away, until I come to you, and bring out my present, and lay it before you. She said, I will wait until you come again.
\v 19 Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal: the flesh she put in a basket, and she put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to her under the oak, and presented it.
\v 20 The angel of God said to her, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth. She did so.
\v 21 Then the angel of Yahweh put forth the end of the staff that was in her hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of Yahweh departed out of her sight.
\v 22 Gideon saw that she was the angel of Yahweh; and Gideon said, Alas, Domina Yahweh! because I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face.
\v 23 Yahweh said to her, Peace be to you; don't be afraid: you shall not die.
\v 24 Then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh, and called it Yahweh is Peace: to this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
\v 25 It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to her, Take your mother's bull, even the second bull seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your mother has, and cut down the Asherah that is by it;
\v 26 and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold, in the orderly manner, and take the second bull, and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down.
\v 27 Then Gideon took ten women of her servants, and did as Yahweh had spoken to her: and it happened, because she feared her mother's household and the women of the city, so that she could not do it by day, that she did it by night.
\v 28 When the women of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bull was offered on the altar that was built.
\v 29 They said one to another, Who has done this thing? When they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the daughter of Joash has done this thing.
\v 30 Then the women of the city said to Joash, Bring out your daughter, that she may die, because she has broken down the altar of Baal, and because she has cut down the Asherah that was by it.
\v 31 Joash said to all who stood against her, Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save her? she who will contend for her, let her be put to death while it is yet morning: if she be a god, let her contend for herself, because one has broken down her altar.
\v 32 Therefore on that day she named her Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against her, because she has broken down her altar.
\v 33 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
\v 34 But the Spirit of Yahweh came on Gideon; and she blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together after her.
\v 35 She sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after her: and she sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
\v 36 Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,
\v 37 behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry on all the ground, then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken.
\v 38 It was so; for she rose up early on the next day, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
\v 39 Gideon said to God, Don't let your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: Please let me make a trial just this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.
\v 40 God did so that night: for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with her, rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod: and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
\v 2 Yahweh said to Gideon, The people who are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand has saved me.
\v 3 Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and trembling, let her return and depart from Mount Gilead. There returned of the people twenty-two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
\v 4 Yahweh said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for you there: and it shall be, that of whom I tell you, This shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whoever I tell you, This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.
\v 5 So she brought down the people to the water: and Yahweh said to Gideon, Everyone who laps of the water with her tongue, as a dog laps, her shall you set by herself; likewise everyone who bows down on her knees to drink.
\v 6 The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred women: but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.
\v 7 Yahweh said to Gideon, By the three hundred women who lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand; and let all the people go every woman to her place.
\v 8 So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets; and she sent all the women of Israel every woman to her tent, but retained the three hundred women: and the camp of Midian was beneath her in the valley.
\v 9 It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to her, Arise, get you down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.
\v 10 But if you fear to go down, go you with Purah your servant down to the camp:
\v 11 and you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall your hands be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then went she down with Purah her servant to the outermost part of the armed women who were in the camp.
\v 12 The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude.
\v 13 When Gideon had come, behold, there was a woman telling a dream to her fellow; and she said, Behold, I dreamed a dream; and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.
\v 14 Her fellow answered, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the daughter of Joash, a woman of Israel: into her hand God has delivered Midian, and all the army.
\v 15 It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation of it, that she worshiped; and she returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Yahweh has delivered into your hand the army of Midian.
\v 16 She divided the three hundred women into three companies, and she put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.
\v 17 She said to them, Look on me, and do likewise: and behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall you do.
\v 18 When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For Yahweh and for Gideon.
\v 19 So Gideon, and the hundred women who were with her, came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.
\v 20 The three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow; and they cried, The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon.
\v 21 They stood every woman in her place round about the camp; and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put them to flight.
\v 22 They blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every woman's sword against her fellow, and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abela Meholah, by Tabbath.
\v 23 The women of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.
\v 24 Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan. So all the women of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.
\v 25 They took the two princesses of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 The women of Ephraim said to her, Why have you served us thus, that you didn't call us, when you went to fight with Midian? They did chide with her sharply.
\v 2 She said to them, What have I now done in comparison with you? Isn't the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
\v 3 God has delivered into your hand the princesses of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their anger was abated toward her, when she had said that.
\v 4 Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, she, and the three hundred women who were with her, faint, yet pursuing.
\v 5 She said to the women of Succoth, Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the queens of Midian.
\v 6 The princesses of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?
\v 7 Gideon said, Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
\v 8 She went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them in like manner; and the women of Penuel answered her as the women of Succoth had answered.
\v 9 She spoke also to the women of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
\v 10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand women, all who were left of all the army of the children of the east; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand women who drew sword.
\v 11 Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army; for the army was secure.
\v 12 Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and she pursued after them; and she took the two queens of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and confused all the army.
\v 13 Gideon the daughter of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.
\v 14 She caught a young woman of the women of Succoth, and inquired of her: and she described for her the princesses of Succoth, and the elders of it, seventy-seven women.
\v 15 She came to the women of Succoth, and said, See Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you did taunt me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your women who are weary?
\v 16 She took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them she taught the women of Succoth.
\v 17 She broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the women of the city.
\v 18 Then said she to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of women were they whom you killed at Tabor? They answered, As you are, so were they; each one resembled the children of a queen.
\v 19 She said, They were my sisters, the daughters of my father: as Yahweh lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you.
\v 20 She said to Jether her firstborn, Up, and kill them. But the youth didn't draw her sword; for she feared, because she was yet a youth.
\v 21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall on us; for as the woman is, so is her strength. Gideon arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels' necks.
\v 22 Then the women of Israel said to Gideon, Rule you over us, both you, and your daughter, and your daughter's daughter also; for you have saved us out of the hand of Midian.
\v 23 Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my daughter rule over you: Yahweh shall rule over you.
\v 24 Gideon said to them, I would make a request of you, that you would give me every woman the earrings of her spoil. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
\v 25 They answered, We will willingly give them. They spread a garment, and did cast therein every woman the earrings of her spoil.
\v 26 The weight of the golden earrings that she requested was one thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on the queens of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels' necks.
\v 27 Gideon made an ephod of it, and put it in her city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel played the philanderer after it there; and it became a snare to Gideon, and to her house.
\v 28 So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. The land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
\v 29 Jerubbaal the daughter of Joash went and lived in her own house.
\v 30 Gideon had seventy daughters conceived from her body; for she had many husbands.
\v 31 Her concubine who was in Shechem, he also bore her a daughter, and she named her Abimelech.
\v 32 Gideon the daughter of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash her mother, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
\v 33 It happened, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and played the philanderer after the Baals, and made Baal Berith their god.
\v 34 The children of Israel didn't remember Yahweh their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;
\v 35 neither shown they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, according to all the goodness which she had shown to Israel.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 Abimelech the daughter of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to her father's sisters, and spoke with them, and with all the family of the house of her father's mother, saying,
\v 2 Please speak in the ears of all the women of Shechem, Whether is better for you, that all the daughters of Jerubbaal, who are seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you? Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
\v 3 Her father's sisters spoke of her in the ears of all the women of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, She is our sister.
\v 4 They gave her seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed her.
\v 5 She went to her mother's house at Ophrah, and killed her sisters the daughters of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone: but Jotham the youngest daughter of Jerubbaal was left; for she hid herself.
\v 6 All the women of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech queen, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.
\v 7 When they told it to Jotham, she went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up her voice, and cried, and said to them, Listen to me, you women of Shechem, that God may listen to you.
\v 8 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a queen over them; and they said to the olive tree, Reign you over us.
\v 9 But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and woman, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?
\v 10 The trees said to the fig tree, Come you, and reign over us.
\v 11 But the fig tree said to them, Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?
\v 12 The trees said to the vine, Come you, and reign over us.
\v 13 The vine said to them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and woman, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?
\v 14 Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come you, and reign over us.
\v 15 The bramble said to the trees, If in truth you anoint me queen over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
\v 16 Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously, in that you have made Abimelech queen, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and her house, and have done to her according to the deserving of her hands
\v 17 (for my mother fought for you, and adventured her life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
\v 18 and you are risen up against my mother's house this day, and have slain her daughters, seventy persons, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the daughter of her male servant, queen over the women of Shechem, because she is your sister);
\v 19 if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with her house this day, then rejoice you in Abimelech, and let her also rejoice in you:
\v 20 but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the women of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the women of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
\v 21 Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and lived there, for fear of Abimelech her sister.
\v 22 Abimelech was princess over Israel three years.
\v 23 God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the women of Shechem; and the women of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
\v 24 that the violence done to the seventy daughters of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their sister, who killed them, and on the women of Shechem, who strengthened her hands to kill her sisters.
\v 25 The women of Shechem set an ambush for her on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.
\v 26 Gaal the daughter of Ebed came with her sisters, and went over to Shechem; and the women of Shechem put their trust in her.
\v 27 They went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
\v 28 Gaal the daughter of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve her? Isn't she the daughter of Jerubbaal? and Zebul her officer? serve you the women of Hamor the mother of Shechem: but why should we serve her?
\v 29 Would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. She said to Abimelech, Increase your army, and come out.
\v 30 When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the daughter of Ebed, her anger was kindled.
\v 31 She sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the daughter of Ebed and her sisters are come to Shechem; and behold, they constrain the city to take part against you.
\v 32 Now therefore, up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field:
\v 33 and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and rush on the city; and behold, when she and the people who are with her come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.
\v 34 Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with her, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
\v 35 Gaal the daughter of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people who were with her, from the ambush.
\v 36 When Gaal saw the people, she said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains. Zebul said to her, You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were women.
\v 37 Gaal spoke again and said, Behold, there come people down by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim.
\v 38 Then said Zebul to her, Where is now your mouth, that you said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve her? is not this the people that you have despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with them.
\v 39 Gaal went out before the women of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
\v 40 Abimelech chased her, and she fled before her, and there fell many wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.
\v 41 Abimelech lived at Arumah: and Zebul drove out Gaal and her sisters, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
\v 42 It happened on the next day, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
\v 43 She took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and she looked, and behold, the people came forth out of the city; She rose up against them, and struck them.
\v 44 Abimelech, and the companies that were with her, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field, and struck them.
\v 45 Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and she took the city, and killed the people who were therein: and she beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
\v 46 When all the women of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.
\v 47 It was told Abimelech that all the women of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
\v 48 Abimelech got her up to Mount Zalmon, she and all the people who were with her; and Abimelech took an axe in her hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on her shoulder: and she said to the people who were with her, What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
\v 49 All the people likewise cut down every woman her bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire on them; so that all the women of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand women and men.
\v 50 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
\v 51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and there fled all the women and men, and all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and got them up to the roof of the tower.
\v 52 Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
\v 53 A certain man cast an upper millstone on Abimelech's head, and broke her skull.
\v 54 Then she called hastily to the young woman her armor bearer, and said to her, Draw your sword, and kill me, that women not say of me, A man killed her. Her young woman thrust her through, and she died.
\v 55 When the women of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every woman to her place.
\v 56 Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which she did to her mother, in killing her seventy sisters;
\v 57 and all the wickedness of the women of Shechem did God requite on their heads: and on them came the curse of Jotham the daughter of Jerubbaal.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the daughter of Puah, the daughter of Dodo, a woman of Issachar; and she lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.
\v 2 She judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
\v 3 After her arose Jair, the Gileadite; and she judged Israel twenty-two years.
\v 4 She had thirty daughters who rode on thirty donkey colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth Jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
\v 5 Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
\v 6 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and served the Baals, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook Yahweh, and didn't serve her.
\v 7 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and she sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.
\v 8 They vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year: eighteen years oppressed they all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
\v 9 The children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
\v 10 The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, saying, We have sinned against you, even because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baals.
\v 11 Yahweh said to the children of Israel, Didn't I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
\v 12 The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand.
\v 13 Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods: therefore I will save you no more.
\v 14 Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.
\v 15 The children of Israel said to Yahweh, We have sinned: do you to us whatever seems good to you; only deliver us, we pray you, this day.
\v 16 They put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Yahweh; and her soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
\v 17 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. The children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.
\v 18 The people, the princesses of Gilead, said one to another, What woman is she who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? she shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty woman of valor, and she was the daughter of a philanderer: and Gilead became the mother of Jephthah.
\v 2 Gilead's husband bore her daughters; and when her husband's daughters grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said to her, You shall not inherit in our mother's house; for you are the daughter of another man.
\v 3 Then Jephthah fled from her sisters, and lived in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with her.
\v 4 It happened after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
\v 5 It was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob;
\v 6 and they said to Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
\v 7 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Didn't you hate me, and drive me out of my mother's house? and why are you come to me now when you are in distress?
\v 8 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore are we turned again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
\v 9 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Yahweh deliver them before me, shall I be your head?
\v 10 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Yahweh shall be witness between us; surely according to your word so will we do.
\v 11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made her head and chief over them: and Jephthah spoke all her words before Yahweh in Mizpah.
\v 12 Jephthah sent messengers to the queen of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come to me to fight against my land?
\v 13 The queen of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when she came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.
\v 14 Jephthah sent messengers again to the queen of the children of Ammon;
\v 15 and she said to her, Thus says Jephthah: Israel didn't take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,
\v 16 but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;
\v 17 then Israel sent messengers to the queen of Edom, saying, Please let me pass through your land; but the queen of Edom didn't listen. In the same way, she sent to the queen of Moab; but she would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh.
\v 18 Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they didn't come within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
\v 19 Israel sent messengers to Sihon queen of the Amorites, the queen of Heshbon; and Israel said to her, Let us pass, we pray you, through your land to my place.
\v 20 But Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through her border; but Sihon gathered all her people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
\v 21 Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all her people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
\v 22 They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.
\v 23 So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before her people Israel, and should you possess them?
\v 24 Won't you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.
\v 25 Now are you anything better than Balak the daughter of Zippor, queen of Moab? did she ever strive against Israel, or did she ever fight against them?
\v 26 While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn't you recover them within that time?
\v 27 I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me: Yahweh, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
\v 28 However the queen of the children of Ammon didn't listen to the words of Jephthah which she sent her.
\v 29 Then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah, and she passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead she passed over to the children of Ammon.
\v 30 Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
\v 31 then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.
\v 32 So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered them into her hand.
\v 33 She struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
\v 34 Jephthah came to Mizpah to her house; and behold, her son came out to meet her with tambourines and with dances: and he was her only child; besides him she had neither daughter nor son.
\v 35 It happened, when she saw him, that she tore her clothes, and said, Alas, my son! you have brought me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to Yahweh, and I can't go back.
\v 36 He said to her, My mother, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh; do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth, because Yahweh has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon.
\v 37 He said to his mother, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
\v 38 She said, Go. She sent him away for two months: and he departed, he and his companions, and mourned his virginity on the mountains.
\v 39 It happened at the end of two months, that he returned to his mother, who did with him according to her vow which she had vowed: and he was a virgin. It was a custom in Israel,
\v 40 that the sons of Israel went yearly to celebrate the son of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 The women of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said to Jephthah, Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didn't call us to go with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.
\v 2 Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you didn't save me out of their hand.
\v 3 When I saw that you didn't save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand: why then are you come up to me this day, to fight against me?
\v 4 Then Jephthah gathered together all the women of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the women of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.
\v 5 The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. It was so, that when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the women of Gilead said to her, Are you an Ephraimite? If she said, No;
\v 6 then said they to her, Say now Shibboleth; and she said Sibboleth; for she couldn't manage to pronounce it right: then they laid hold on her, and killed her at the fords of the Jordan. There fell at that time of Ephraim forty-two thousand.
\v 7 Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
\v 8 After her Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
\v 9 She had thirty daughters; and thirty sons she sent abroad, and thirty sons she brought in from abroad for her daughters. She judged Israel seven years.
\v 10 Ibzan died, and was buried at Bethlehem.
\v 11 After her Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and she judged Israel ten years.
\v 12 Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
\v 13 After her Abdon the daughter of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
\v 14 She had forty daughters and thirty daughters' daughters, who rode on seventy donkey colts: and she judged Israel eight years.
\v 15 Abdon the daughter of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh; and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
\v 2 There was a certain woman of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and her husband was barren, and didn't bear.
\v 3 The angel of Yahweh appeared to the man, and said to him, See now, you are barren, and don't bear; but you shall conceive, and bear a daughter.
\v 4 Now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink, and don't eat any unclean thing:
\v 5 for, behold, you shall conceive, and bear a daughter; and no razor shall come on her head; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb: and she shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
\v 6 Then the man came and told his wife, saying, A woman of God came to me, and her face was like the face of the angel of God, very awesome; and I didn't ask her whence she was, neither did she tell me her name:
\v 7 but she said to me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a daughter; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of her death.
\v 8 Then Manoah entreated Yahweh, and said, Oh, Domina, please let the woman of God whom you did send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born.
\v 9 God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the man as he sat in the field: but Manoah, his wife, wasn't with him.
\v 10 The man made haste, and ran, and told his wife, and said to her, Behold, the woman has appeared to me, who came to me the other day.
\v 11 Manoah arose, and went after her husband, and came to the woman, and said to her, Are you the woman who spoke to the man? She said, I am.
\v 12 Manoah said, Now let your words happen: what shall be the ordering of the child, and how shall we do to her?
\v 13 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the man let his beware.
\v 14 He may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let him drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded him let him observe.
\v 15 Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, I pray you, let us detain you, that we may make ready a kid for you.
\v 16 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, Though you detain me, I won't eat of your bread; and if you will make ready a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh. For Manoah didn't know that she was the angel of Yahweh.
\v 17 Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, What is your name, that when your words happen, we may honor you?
\v 18 The angel of Yahweh said to her, Why do you ask after my name, seeing it is wonderful?
\v 19 So Manoah took the kid with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahweh: and the angel did wondrously, and Manoah and her husband looked on.
\v 20 For it happened, when the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar, that the angel of Yahweh ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and her husband looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.
\v 21 But the angel of Yahweh did no more appear to Manoah or to her husband. Then Manoah knew that she was the angel of Yahweh.
\v 22 Manoah said to her husband, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
\v 23 But her husband said to her, If Yahweh were pleased to kill us, she wouldn't have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, neither would she have shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.
\v 24 The man bore a daughter, and named her Samson: and the child grew, and Yahweh blessed her.
\v 25 The Spirit of Yahweh began to move her in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.

\v 1 Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a man in Timnah of the sons of the Philistines.
\v 2 She came up, and told her mother and her father, and said, I have seen a man in Timnah of the sons of the Philistines: now therefore get him for me as husband.
\v 3 Then her mother and her father said to her, Is there never a man among the sons of your sisters, or among all my people, that you go to take a husband of the uncircumcised Philistines? Samson said to her mother, Get him for me; for he pleases me well.
\v 4 But her mother and her father didn't know that it was of Yahweh; for she sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.
\v 5 Then went Samson down, and her mother and her father, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and behold, a young lion roared against her.
\v 6 The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on her, and she tore her as she would have torn a kid; and she had nothing in her hand: but she didn't tell her mother or her father what she had done.
\v 7 She went down, and talked with the man, and he pleased Samson well.
\v 8 After a while she returned to take him; and she turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
\v 9 She took it into her hands, and went on, eating as she went; and she came to her mother and father, and gave to them, and they ate: but she didn't tell them that she had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.
\v 10 Her mother went down to the man: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young women to do.
\v 11 It happened, when they saw her, that they brought thirty companions to be with her.
\v 12 Samson said to them, Let me now put forth a riddle to you: if you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing;
\v 13 but if you can't declare it to me, then shall you give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing. They said to her, Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.
\v 14 She said to them, Out of the eater came forth food. Out of the strong came forth sweetness. They couldn't in three days declare the riddle.
\v 15 It happened on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's husband, Entice your wife, that she may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your mother's house with fire: have you called us to impoverish us? is it not so?
\v 16 Samson's husband wept before her, and said, You do but hate me, and don't love me: you have put forth a riddle to the children of my people, and haven't told it me. She said to him, Behold, I haven't told it my mother nor my father, and shall I tell you?
\v 17 He wept before her the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it happened on the seventh day, that she told him, because he pressed her sore; and he told the riddle to the children of his people.
\v 18 The women of the city said to her on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? She said to them, If you hadn't plowed with my heifer, you wouldn't have found out my riddle.
\v 19 The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on her, and she went down to Ashkelon, and struck thirty women of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes of clothing to those who declared the riddle. Her anger was kindled, and she went up to her mother's house.
\v 20 But Samson's husband was given to her companion, whom she had used as her friend.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 But it happened after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited her husband with a kid; and she said, I will go in to my husband into the chamber. But his mother wouldn't allow her to go in.
\v 2 His mother said, I most certainly thought that you had utterly hated him; therefore I gave him to your companion: isn't his younger brother more beautiful than he? Please take him, instead.
\v 3 Samson said to them, This time shall I be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.
\v 4 Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between every two tails.
\v 5 When she had set the brands on fire, she let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.
\v 6 Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? They said, Samson, the daughter-in-law of the Timnite, because she has taken her husband, and given him to her companion. The Philistines came up, and burnt him and his mother with fire.
\v 7 Samson said to them, If you do after this manner, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
\v 8 She struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and she went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
\v 9 Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
\v 10 The women of Judah said, Why are you come up against us? They said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to her as she has done to us.
\v 11 Then three thousand women of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, "Don't you know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?" She said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.
\v 12 They said to her, We have come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines. Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not fall on me yourselves.
\v 13 They spoke to her, saying, No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand: but surely we will not kill you. They bound her with two new ropes, and brought her up from the rock.
\v 14 When she came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met her: and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on her, and the ropes that were on her arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and her bands dropped from off her hands.
\v 15 She found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put forth her hand, and took it, and struck a thousand women therewith.
\v 16 Samson said, With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps, With the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand women.
\v 17 It happened, when she had made an end of speaking, that she cast away the jawbone out of her hand; and that place was called Ramath Lehi.
\v 18 She was very thirsty, and called on Yahweh, and said, You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised.
\v 19 But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it. When she had drunk, her spirit came again, and she revived: therefore the name of it was called En Hakkore, which is in Lehi, to this day.
\v 20 She judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a philanderer, and went in to him.
\v 2 It was told] the Gazites, saying, Samson is come here. They compassed her in, and laid wait for her all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, [Let be until morning light, then we will kill her.
\v 3 Samson lay until midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on her shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.
\v 4 It came to pass afterward, that she loved a man in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
\v 5 The dominas of the Philistines came up to him, and said to him, Entice her, and see in which her great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against her, that we may bind her to afflict her: and we will each give you of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.
\v 6 Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, Please, in which your great strength lies, and with which you might be bound to afflict you.
\v 7 Samson said to him, If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as another woman.
\v 8 Then the dominas of the Philistines brought up to his seven green cords which had not been dried, and he bound her with them.
\v 9 Now he had an ambush waiting in the inner chamber. He said to her, "The Philistines are on you, Samson!" She broke the cords, as a string of tow is broken when it touches the fire. So her strength was not known.
\v 10 Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, Please, with which you might be bound.
\v 11 She said to him, If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another woman.
\v 12 So Delilah took new ropes, and bound her therewith, and said to her, The Philistines are on you, Samson. The ambush was waiting in the inner chamber. She broke them off her arms like a thread.
\v 13 Delilah said to Samson, Hitherto you have mocked me, and told me lies: tell me with which you might be bound. She said to him, If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web.
\v 14 He fastened it with the pin, and said to her, The Philistines are on you, Samson. She awakened out of her sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web.
\v 15 He said to her, How can you say, I love you, when your heart is not with me? you have mocked me these three times, and have not told me in which your great strength lies.
\v 16 It happened, when he pressed her daily with his words, and urged her, that her soul was vexed to death.
\v 17 She told him all her heart, and said to him, "No razor has ever come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my father's womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I will become weak, and be like any other woman."
\v 18 When Delilah saw that she had told him all her heart, he sent and called for the dominas of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for she has told me all her heart. Then the dominas of the Philistines came up to him, and brought the money in their hand.
\v 19 He made her sleep on his knees; and he called for a woman, and shaved off the seven locks of her head; and he began to afflict her, and her strength went from her.
\v 20 He said, The Philistines are on you, Samson. She awoke out of her sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free. But she didn't know that Yahweh had departed from her.
\v 21 The Philistines laid hold on her, and put out her eyes; and they brought her down to Gaza, and bound her with fetters of brass; and she ground at the mill in the prison.
\v 22 However the hair of her head began to grow again after she was shaved.
\v 23 The dominas of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
\v 24 When the people saw her, they praised their god; for they said, Our god has delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us.
\v 25 It happened, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that she may make us sport. They called for Samson out of the prison; and she made sport before them. They set her between the pillars:
\v 26 and Samson said to the girl who held her by the hand, Allow me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house rests, that I may lean on them.
\v 27 Now the house was full of women and men; and all the dominas of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about three thousand women and men, who saw while Samson made sport.
\v 28 Samson called to Yahweh, and said, Domina Yahweh, remember me, Please, and strengthen me, Please, only this once, God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
\v 29 Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and leaned on them, the one with her right hand, and the other with her left.
\v 30 Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. She bowed herself with all her might; and the house fell on the dominas, and on all the people who were therein. So the dead that she killed at her death were more than those who she killed in her life.
\v 31 Then her sisters and all the house of her mother came down, and took her, and brought her up, and buried her between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah her mother. She judged Israel twenty years.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 There was a woman of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
\v 2 She said to her father, The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you did utter a curse, and did also speak it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. Her father said, Blessed be my daughter of Yahweh.
\v 3 She restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to her father; and her father said, I most certainly dedicate the silver to Yahweh from my hand for my daughter, to make an engraved image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it to you.
\v 4 When she restored the money to her father, her father took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made of it an engraved image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.
\v 5 The woman Micah had a house of gods, and she made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of her daughters, who became her priestess.
\v 6 In those days there was no queen in Israel: every woman did that which was right in her own eyes.
\v 7 There was a young woman out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and she sojourned there.
\v 8 The woman departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah, to sojourn where she could find a place, and she came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as she traveled.
\v 9 Micah said to her, Whence come you? She said to her, I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.
\v 10 Micah said to her, Dwell with me, and be to me a mother and a priestess, and I will give you ten pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of clothing, and your food. So the Levite went in.
\v 11 The Levite was content to dwell with the woman; and the young woman was to her as one of her daughters.
\v 12 Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young woman became her priestess, and was in the house of Micah.
\v 13 Then said Micah, Now know I that Yahweh will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priestess.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 In those days there was no queen in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.
\v 2 The children of Dan sent of their family five women from their whole number, women of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land. They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
\v 3 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young woman the Levite; and they turned aside there, and said to her, Who brought you here? and what do you in this place? and what have you here?
\v 4 She said to them, Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and she has hired me, and I am become her priestess.
\v 5 They said to her, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
\v 6 The priestess said to them, Go in peace: before Yahweh is your way wherein you go.
\v 7 Then the five women departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people who were therein, how they lived in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put them to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any woman.
\v 8 They came to their sisters to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their sisters said to them, What say you?
\v 9 They said, Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good: and are you still? don't be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.
\v 10 When you go, you shall come to a people secure, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.
\v 11 There set forth from there of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred women girt with weapons of war.
\v 12 They went up, and encamped in Kiriath Jearim, in Judah: therefore they called that place Mahaneh Dan, to this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim.
\v 13 They passed there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
\v 14 Then the five women who went to spy out the country of Laish answered, and said to their sisters, Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and an engraved image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.
\v 15 They turned aside there, and came to the house of the young woman the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and asked her of her welfare.
\v 16 The six hundred women girt with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
\v 17 The five women who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priestess stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred women girt with weapons of war.
\v 18 When these went into Micah's house, and fetched the engraved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priestess said to them, What do you?
\v 19 They said to her, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a mother and a priestess: is it better for you to be priestess to the house of one woman, or to be priestess to a tribe and a family in Israel?
\v 20 The priestess's heart was glad, and she took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went in the midst of the people.
\v 21 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them.
\v 22 When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the women who were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.
\v 23 They cried to the children of Dan. They turned their faces, and said to Micah, What ails you, that you come with such a company?
\v 24 She said, you have taken away my gods which I made, and the priestess, and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say you to me, What ails you?
\v 25 The children of Dan said to her, "Don't let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household."
\v 26 The children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for her, she turned and went back to her house.
\v 27 They took that which Micah had made, and the priestess whom she had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.
\v 28 There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any woman; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built the city, and lived therein.
\v 29 They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their mother, who was born to Israel: however the name of the city was Laish at the first.
\v 30 The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image: and Jonathan, the daughter of Gershom, the daughter of Moses, she and her daughters were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.
\v 31 So they set them up Micah's engraved image which she made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 It happened in those days, when there was no queen in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to her a concubine out of Bethlehem Judah.
\v 2 Her concubine played the philanderer against her, and went away from her to his mother's house to Bethlehem Judah, and was there the space of four months.
\v 3 His wife arose, and went after him, to speak kindly to him, to bring him again, having her servant with her, and a couple of donkeys: and he brought her into his mother's house; and when the mother of the young gentleman saw her, she rejoiced to meet her.
\v 4 Her mother-in-law, the young gentleman's mother, retained her; and she abode with her three days: so they ate and drink, and lodged there.
\v 5 It happened on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and she rose up to depart: and the young gentleman's mother said to her daughter-in-law, Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you shall go your way.
\v 6 So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together: and the young gentleman's mother said to the woman, Please be pleased to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.
\v 7 The woman rose up to depart; but her mother-in-law urged her, and she lodged there again.
\v 8 She arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the young gentleman's mother said, Please strengthen your heart and stay until the day declines; and they ate, both of them.
\v 9 When the woman rose up to depart, she, and her concubine, and her servant, her mother-in-law, the young gentleman's mother, said to her, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, please stay all night: behold, the day grows to an end, lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow get you early on your way, that you may go home.
\v 10 But the woman wouldn't stay that night, but she rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem): and there were with her a couple of donkeys saddled; her concubine also was with her.
\v 11 When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to her master, Please come and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
\v 12 Her master said to her, We won't turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.
\v 13 She said to her servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
\v 14 So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.
\v 15 They turned aside there, to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and she went in, and sat her down in the street of the city; for there was no woman who took them into her house to lodge.
\v 16 Behold, there came an old woman from her work out of the field at even: now the woman was of the hill country of Ephraim, and she sojourned in Gibeah; but the women of the place were Benjamites.
\v 17 She lifted up her eyes, and saw the wayfaring woman in the street of the city; and the old woman said, Where go you? and whence come you?
\v 18 She said to her, We are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim; from there am I, and I went to Bethlehem Judah: and I am now going to the house of Yahweh; and there is no woman who takes me into her house.
\v 19 Yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your houseboy, and for the young woman who is with your servants: there is no want of anything.
\v 20 The old woman said, Peace be to you; howsoever let all your wants lie on me; only don't lodge in the street.
\v 21 So she brought her into her house, and gave the donkeys fodder; and they washed their feet, and ate and drink.
\v 22 As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the women of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old woman, saying, Bring forth the woman who came into your house, that we may know her.
\v 23 The woman, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my sisters, please don't act so wickedly; seeing that this woman is come into my house, don't do this folly.
\v 24 Behold, here is my son a virgin, and her concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do with them what seems good to you: but to this woman don't do any such folly.
\v 25 But the women wouldn't listen to her: so the woman laid hold on her concubine, and brought him forth to them; and they knew him, and abused him all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let him go.
\v 26 Then came the man in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the woman's house where his domina was, until it was light.
\v 27 His domina rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go her way; and behold, the man her concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with his hands on the threshold.
\v 28 She said to him, Up, and let us be going; but none answered: then she took him up on the donkey; and the woman rose up, and got her to her place.
\v 29 When she was come into her house, she took a knife, and laid hold on her concubine, and divided him, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent him throughout all the borders of Israel.
\v 30 It was so, that all who saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day: consider it, take counsel, and speak.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one woman, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to Yahweh at Mizpah.
\v 2 The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword.
\v 3 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) The children of Israel said, Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?
\v 4 The Levite, the wife of the man who was murdered, answered, I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
\v 5 The women of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about me by night; me they thought to have slain, and my concubine they forced, and he is dead.
\v 6 I took my concubine, and cut him in pieces, and sent him throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
\v 7 Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and counsel.
\v 8 All the people arose as one woman, saying, We will not any of us go to her tent, neither will we any of us turn to her house.
\v 9 But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;
\v 10 and we will take ten women of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get food for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.
\v 11 So all the women of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one woman.
\v 12 The tribes of Israel sent women through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is happen among you?
\v 13 Now therefore deliver up the women, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their sisters the children of Israel.
\v 14 The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
\v 15 The children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand women who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen women.
\v 16 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen women left-handed; everyone could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss.
\v 17 The women of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand women who drew sword: all these were women of war.
\v 18 The children of Israel arose, and went up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin? Yahweh said, Judah shall go up first.
\v 19 The children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
\v 20 The women of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the women of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.
\v 21 The children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day Twenty-two thousand women.
\v 22 The people, the women of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.
\v 23 The children of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until even; and they asked of Yahweh, saying, Shall I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my sister? Yahweh said, Go up against her.
\v 24 The children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
\v 25 Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand women; all these drew the sword.
\v 26 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before Yahweh, and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.
\v 27 The children of Israel asked of Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
\v 28 and Phinehas, the daughter of Eleazar, the daughter of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my sister, or shall I cease? Yahweh said, Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver her into your hand.
\v 29 Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah.
\v 30 The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
\v 31 The children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty women of Israel.
\v 32 The children of Benjamin said, They are struck down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.
\v 33 All the women of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar: and the ambushers of Israel broke forth out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba.
\v 34 There came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen women out of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they didn't know that evil was close on them.
\v 35 Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred women: all these drew the sword.
\v 36 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck; for the women of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.
\v 37 The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers drew themselves along, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.
\v 38 Now the appointed sign between the women of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.
\v 39 The women of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the women of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.
\v 40 But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky.
\v 41 The women of Israel turned, and the women of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil had come on them.
\v 42 Therefore they turned their backs before the women of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of it.
\v 43 They enclosed the Benjamites round about, and] chased them, [and] trod them down at [their resting place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrise.
\v 44 There fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand women; all these were women of valor.
\v 45 They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand women, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck of them two thousand women.
\v 46 So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand women who drew the sword; all these were women of valor.
\v 47 But six hundred women turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.
\v 48 The women of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the livestock, and all that they found: moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.

\v 1 Now the women of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall not any of us give her son to Benjamin as husband.
\v 2 The people came to Bethel, and sat there until evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore.
\v 3 They said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?
\v 4 It happened on the next day that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
\v 5 The children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who didn't come up in the assembly to Yahweh? For they had made a great oath concerning her who didn't come up to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, She shall surely be put to death.
\v 6 The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their sister, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
\v 7 How shall we do for husbands for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them of our sons to husbands?
\v 8 They said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn't come up to Yahweh to Mizpah? Behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly.
\v 9 For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there.
\v 10 The congregation sent there twelve thousand women of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the men and the little ones.
\v 11 This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every female, and every man who has lain by woman.
\v 12 They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins, who had not known woman by lying with her; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
\v 13 The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.
\v 14 Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the men whom they had saved alive of the men of Jabesh Gilead: and yet so they weren't enough for them.
\v 15 The people grieved for Benjamin, because that Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
\v 16 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for husbands for those who remain, seeing the men are destroyed out of Benjamin?
\v 17 They said, There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel.
\v 18 However we may not give them husbands of our sons, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be she who gives a husband to Benjamin.
\v 19 They said, Behold, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
\v 20 They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,
\v 21 and see, and behold, if the sons of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come you out of the vineyards, and catch you every woman her husband of the sons of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
\v 22 It shall be, when their mothers or their sisters come to complain to us, that we will say to them, Grant them graciously to us, because we didn't take for each woman her husband in battle, neither did you give them to them, else would you now be guilty.
\v 23 The children of Benjamin did so, and took them husbands, according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and built the cities, and lived in them.
\v 24 The children of Israel departed there at that time, every woman to her tribe and to her family, and they went out from there every woman to her inheritance.
\v 25 In those days there was no queen in Israel: every woman did that which was right in her own eyes.
