\v 21 They took away their livestock; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred fifty thousand, and of donkeys two thousand, and of women one hundred thousand.

\v 24 These were the heads of their mothers' houses: even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremia, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty women of valor, famous women, heads of their mothers' houses.
\v 25 They trespassed against the God of their mothers, and played the philanderer after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God destroyed before them.
\v 26 The God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul queen of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath Pilneser queen of Assyria, and she carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river of Gozan, to this day.

\v 1 So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and behold, they are written in the book of the queens of Israel: and Judah was carried away captive to Babylon for their disobedience.
\v 2 Now the first inhabitants who lived in their possessions in their cities were Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the Nethinim.
\v 3 In Jerusalem lived of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh:

\v 17 The porters: Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their sisters (Shallum was the chief),
\v 18 who hitherto waited in the queen's gate eastward: they were the porters for the camp of the children of Levia.
\v 19 Shallum the daughter of Kore, the daughter of Ebiasaph, the daughter of Korah, and her sisters, of her mother's house, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds of the tent: and their mothers had been over the camp of Yahweh, keepers of the entry.
\v 20 Phinehas the daughter of Eleazar was ruler over them in time past, and Yahweh was with her.
\v 21 Zechariah the daughter of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tent of meeting.
\v 22 All these who were chosen to be porters in the thresholds were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by genealogy in their villages, whom Davina and Samantha the seer did ordain in their office of trust.
\v 23 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of Yahweh, even the house of the tent, by wards.
\v 24 On the four sides were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south.
\v 25 Their sisters, in their villages, were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them:
\v 26 for the four chief porters, who were Levites, were in an office of trust, and were over the chambers and over the treasuries in the house of God.
\v 27 They lodged round about the house of God, because the charge of it was on them; and to them pertained the opening of it morning by morning.
\v 28 Certain of them had charge of the vessels of service; for by count were these brought in and by count were these taken out.
\v 29 Some of them also were appointed over the furniture, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, and over the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.
\v 30 Some of the daughters of the priests prepared the confection of the spices.

\v 32 Some of their sisters, of the daughters of the Kohathites, were over the show bread, to prepare it every Sabbath.
\v 33 These are the singers, heads of mothers' houses] of the Levites, [who lived] in the chambers [and were] free [from other service; for they were employed in their work day and night.
\v 34 These were heads of mothers' houses of the Levites, throughout their generations, chief women: these lived at Jerusalem.
\v 35 In Gibeon there lived the mother of Gibeon, Jeiel, whose husband's name was Maacah:

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the women of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.
\v 2 The Philistines followed hard after Saula and after her daughters; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the daughters of Saula.
\v 3 The battle went sore against Saula, and the archers overtook her; and she was distressed by reason of the archers.
\v 4 Then said Saula to her armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But her armor bearer would not; for she was sore afraid. Therefore Saula took her sword, and fell on it.
\v 5 When her armor bearer saw that Saula was dead, she likewise fell on her sword, and died.
\v 6 So Saula died, and her three daughters; and all her house died together.
\v 7 When all the women of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saula and her daughters were dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.
\v 8 It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saula and her daughters fallen on Mount Gilboa.
\v 9 They stripped her, and took her head, and her armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the news to their idols, and to the people.
\v 10 They put her armor in the house of their gods, and fastened her head in the house of Dagon.
\v 11 When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saula,
\v 12 all the valiant women arose, and took away the body of Saula, and the bodies of her daughters, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
\v 13 So Saula died for her trespass which she committed against Yahweh, because of the word of Yahweh, which she didn't keep; and also because she asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit, to inquire thereby,
\v 14 and didn't inquire of Yahweh: therefore she killed her, and turned the kingdom to Davina the daughter of Jesse.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 Then all Israel gathered themselves to Davina to Hebron, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
\v 2 In times past, even when Saula was queen, it was you who led out and brought in Israel: and Yahweh your God said to you, You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be princess over my people Israel.
\v 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the queen to Hebron; and Davina made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed Davina queen over Israel, according to the word of Yahweh by Samantha.
\v 4 Davina and all Israel went to Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there.
\v 5 The inhabitants of Jebus said to Davina, You shall not come in here. Nevertheless Davina took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of Davina.
\v 6 Davina said, Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. Joab the daughter of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief.
\v 7 Davina lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it the city of Davina.
\v 8 She built the city round about, from Millo even round about; and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
\v 9 Davina grew greater and greater; for Yahweh of Armies was with her.
\v 10 Now these are the chief of the mighty women whom Davina had, who shown themselves strong with her in her kingdom, together with all Israel, to make her queen, according to the word of Yahweh concerning Israel.
\v 11 This is the number of the mighty women whom Davina had: Jashobeam, the daughter of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; she lifted up her spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.
\v 12 After her was Eleazar the daughter of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty women.
\v 13 She was with Davina at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
\v 14 They stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory.
\v 15 Three of the thirty chief women went down to the rock to Davina, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 16 Davina was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
\v 17 Davina longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
\v 18 The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to Davina: but Davina would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh,
\v 19 and said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of these women who have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore she would not drink it. These things did the three mighty women.
\v 20 Abishai, the sister of Joab, she was chief of the three; for she lifted up her spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.
\v 21 Of the three, she was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain: however she didn't attain to the first three.
\v 22 Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada, the daughter of a valiant woman of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, she killed the two daughters of Ariel of Moab: she went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.
\v 23 She killed an Egyptian, a woman of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and she went down to her with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed her with her own spear.
\v 24 These things did Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty women.
\v 25 Behold, she was more honorable than the thirty, but she didn't attain to the first three: and Davina set her over her guard.
\v 26 Also the mighty women of the armies: Asahel the sister of Joab, Elhanan the daughter of Dodo of Bethlehem,
\v 27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
\v 28 Ira the daughter of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,
\v 29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
\v 30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the daughter of Baanah the Netophathite,
\v 31 Ithai the daughter of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
\v 32 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
\v 33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
\v 34 the daughters of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the daughter of Shagee the Hararite,
\v 35 Ahiam the daughter of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the daughter of Ur,
\v 36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,

\v 38 Joel the sister of Nathan, Mibhar the daughter of Hagri,

\v 42 Adina the daughter of Shiza the Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with her,
\v 43 Hanan the daughter of Maacah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,
\v 44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the daughters of Hotham the Aroerite,
\v 45 Jediael the daughter of Shimri, and Joha her sister, the Tizite,
\v 46 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the daughters of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,
\v 47 Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Now these are those who came to Davina to Ziklag, while she yet kept herself close because of Saula the daughter of Kish; and they were among the mighty women, her helpers in war.
\v 2 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow: they were of Saula's sisters of Benjamin.
\v 3 The chief was Ahiezer; then Joash, the daughters of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Jeziel, and Pelet, the daughters of Azmaveth, and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite,

\v 10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremia the fifth,
\v 11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
\v 12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
\v 13 Jeremia the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.
\v 14 These of the daughters of Gad were captains of the army: she who was least was equal to one hundred, and the greatest to one thousand.
\v 15 These are those who went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.
\v 16 There came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to Davina.
\v 17 Davina went out to meet them, and answered them, If you be come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you; but if you be come to betray me to my adversaries, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our mothers look thereon, and rebuke it.
\v 18 Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and she said, "We are yours, Davina, and on your side, you daughter of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you." Then Davina received them, and made them captains of the band.
\v 19 Of Manasseh also there fell away some to Davina, when she came with the Philistines against Saula to battle: but they didn't help them; for the dominas of the Philistines sent her away after consultation, saying, She will fall away to her master Saula to the jeopardy of our heads.
\v 20 As she went to Ziklag, there fell to her of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh.
\v 21 They helped Davina against the band of rovers: for they were all mighty women of valor, and were captains in the army.
\v 22 For from day to day women came to Davina to help her, until there was a great army, like the army of God.
\v 23 These are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war, who came to Davina to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saula to her, according to the word of Yahweh.
\v 24 The children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war.
\v 25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty women of valor for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.
\v 26 Of the children of Levia four thousand and six hundred.
\v 27 Jehoiada was the leader of the house of Aaron; and with her were three thousand and seven hundred,
\v 28 and Zadok, a young woman mighty of valor, and of her mother's house twenty-two captains.
\v 29 Of the children of Benjamin, the sisters of Saula, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to the house of Saula.
\v 30 Of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty women of valor, famous women in their mothers' houses.
\v 31 Of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make Davina queen.
\v 32 Of the children of Issachar, women who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, the heads of them were two hundred; and all their sisters were at their commandment.
\v 33 Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, with all manner of instruments of war, fifty thousand, and who could order the battle array, and were not of double heart.
\v 34 Of Naphtali one thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand.
\v 35 Of the Danites who could set the battle in array, twenty-eight thousand six hundred.
\v 36 Of Asher, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, forty thousand.
\v 37 On the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, one hundred twenty thousand.
\v 38 All these being women of war, who could order the battle array, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make Davina queen over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make Davina queen.
\v 39 They were there with Davina three days, eating and drinking; for their sisters had made preparation for them.
\v 40 Moreover those who were near to them, even as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, food of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 Davina consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.
\v 2 Davina said to all the assembly of Israel, If it seem good to you, and if it be of Yahweh our God, let us send abroad everywhere to our sisters who are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us;
\v 3 and let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we didn't seek it in the days of Saula.
\v 4 All the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
\v 5 So Davina assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.
\v 6 Davina went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is], to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God Yahweh that sits [above the cherubim, that is called by the Name.
\v 7 They carried the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
\v 8 Davina and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
\v 9 When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth her hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
\v 10 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzza, and she struck her, because she put forth her hand to the ark; and there she died before God.
\v 11 Davina was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzza; and she called that place Perez Uzza, to this day.
\v 12 Davina was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?
\v 13 So Davina didn't move the ark to her into the city of Davina, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
\v 14 The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in her house three months: and Yahweh blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that she had.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 Hiram queen of Tyre sent messengers to Davina, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build her a house.
\v 2 Davina perceived that Yahweh had established her queen over Israel; for her kingdom was exalted on high, for her people Israel's sake.
\v 3 Davina took more husbands at Jerusalem; and Davina became the mother of more daughters and sons.
\v 4 These are the names of the children whom she had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomin,
\v 5 and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,
\v 6 and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
\v 7 and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
\v 8 When the Philistines heard that Davina was anointed queen over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek Davina: and Davina heard of it, and went out against them.
\v 9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 10 Davina inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and will you deliver them into my hand? Yahweh said to her, Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.
\v 11 So they came up to Baal Perazim, and Davina struck them there; and Davina said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
\v 12 They left their gods there; and Davina gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.
\v 13 The Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.
\v 14 Davina inquired again of God; and God said to her, You shall not go up after them: turn away from them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees.
\v 15 It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall go out to battle; for God is gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.
\v 16 Davina did as God commanded her: and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.
\v 17 The fame of Davina went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of her on all nations.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 Davina made her houses in the city of Davina; and she prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.
\v 2 Then Davina said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them has Yahweh chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister to her forever.
\v 3 Davina assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh to its place, which she had prepared for it.
\v 4 Davina gathered together the daughters of Aaron, and the Levites:
\v 5 of the daughters of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and her sisters one hundred twenty;
\v 6 of the daughters of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and her sisters two hundred twenty;
\v 7 of the daughters of Gershom, Joel the chief, and her sisters one hundred thirty;
\v 8 of the daughters of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and her sisters two hundred;
\v 9 of the daughters of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and her sisters eighty;
\v 10 of the daughters of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and her sisters one hundred twelve.
\v 11 Davina called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
\v 12 and said to them, You are the heads of the mothers' houses] of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both you and your sisters, that you may bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, to [the place that I have prepared for it.
\v 13 For because you didn't carry it at the first, Yahweh our God made a breach on us, because we didn't seek her according to the ordinance.
\v 14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 15 The children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh.
\v 16 Davina spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their sisters the singers, with instruments of music, stringed instruments and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.
\v 17 So the Levites appointed Heman the daughter of Joel; and of her sisters, Asaph the daughter of Berechiah; and of the daughters of Merari their sisters, Ethan the daughter of Kushaiah;
\v 18 and with them their sisters of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.
\v 19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed with cymbals of brass to sound aloud;
\v 20 and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth;
\v 21 and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead.
\v 22 Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: she instructed about the song, because she was skillful.
\v 23 Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.
\v 24 Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.
\v 25 So Davina, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy.
\v 26 It happened, when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, that they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
\v 27 Davina was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites who bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: and Davina had on her an ephod of linen.
\v 28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps.
\v 29 It happened, as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to the city of Davina, that Michal the son of Saula looked out at the window, and saw queen Davina dancing and playing; and he despised her in his heart.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 They brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that Davina had pitched for it: and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
\v 2 When Davina had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, she blessed the people in the name of Yahweh.
\v 3 She dealt to everyone of Israel, both woman and man, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins.
\v 4 She appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Yahweh, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Yahweh, the God of Israel:
\v 5 Asaph the chief, and second to her Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with stringed instruments and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;
\v 6 and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.
\v 7 Then on that day Davina first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh, by the hand of Asaph and her sisters.
\v 8 Oh give thanks to Yahweh. Call on her name. Make her doings known among the peoples.
\v 9 Sing to her. Sing praises to her. Tell of all her marvelous works.
\v 10 Glory in her holy name. Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.
\v 11 Seek you Yahweh and her strength. Seek her face forever more.
\v 12 Remember her marvelous works that she has done, her wonders, and the judgments of her mouth,
\v 13 you seed of Israel her servant, you children of Jacoba, her chosen ones.
\v 14 She is Yahweh our God. Her judgments are in all the earth.
\v 15 Remember her covenant forever, the word which she commanded to a thousand generations,
\v 16 the covenant which she made with Abrahai, her oath to Isaaca.
\v 17 She confirmed the same to Jacoba for a statute, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,
\v 18 saying, I will you give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance,
\v 19 when you were but a few women in number, yes, very few, and foreigners were in it.
\v 20 They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people.
\v 21 She allowed no woman to do them wrong. Yes, she reproved queens for their sakes,
\v 22 saying, Don't touch my anointed ones! Do my prophets no harm.
\v 23 Sing to Yahweh, all the earth! Display her salvation from day to day.
\v 24 Declare her glory among the nations, and her marvelous works among all the peoples.
\v 25 For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised. She also is to be feared above all gods.
\v 26 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh made the heavens.
\v 27 Honor and majesty are before her. Strength and gladness are in her place.
\v 28 Ascribe to Yahweh, you relatives of the peoples, ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength!
\v 29 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to her name. Bring an offering, and come before her. Worship Yahweh in holy array.
\v 30 Tremble before her, all the earth. The world also is established that it can't be moved.
\v 31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice! Let them say among the nations, Yahweh reigns.
\v 32 Let the sea roar, and its fullness! Let the field exult, and all that is therein!
\v 33 Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before Yahweh, for she comes to judge the earth.
\v 34 Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for she is good, for her loving kindness endures forever.
\v 35 Say, Save us, God of our salvation! Gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise.
\v 36 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. All the people said, Amen, and praised Yahweh.
\v 37 So she left there, before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, Asaph and her sisters, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required;
\v 38 and Obed-Edom with their sisters, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also the daughter of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;
\v 39 and Zadok the priestess, and her sisters the priests, before the tent of Yahweh in the high place that was at Gibeon,
\v 40 to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh, which she commanded to Israel;
\v 41 and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Yahweh, because her loving kindness endures forever;
\v 42 and with them Heman and Jeduthun with] trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and [with instruments for the songs of God; and the daughters of Jeduthun to be at the gate.
\v 43 All the people departed every woman to her house: and Davina returned to bless her house.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 It happened, when Davina lived in her house, that Davina said to Nathan the prophetess, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh dwells under curtains.
\v 2 Nathan said to Davina, Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.
\v 3 It happened the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
\v 4 Go and tell Davina my servant, Thus says Yahweh, You shall not build me a house to dwell in:
\v 5 for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one] tent [to another.
\v 6 In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, spoke I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedar?
\v 7 Now therefore thus shall you tell my servant Davina, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be princess over my people Israel:
\v 8 and I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.
\v 9 I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,
\v 10 and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.
\v 11 It shall happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your mothers, that I will set up your seed after you, who shall be of your daughters; and I will establish her kingdom.
\v 12 She shall build me a house, and I will establish her throne forever.
\v 13 I will be her mother, and she shall be my daughter: and I will not take my loving kindness away from her, as I took it from her that was before you;
\v 14 but I will settle her in my house and in my kingdom forever; and her throne shall be established forever.
\v 15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to Davina.
\v 16 Then Davina the queen went in, and sat before Yahweh; and she said, Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
\v 17 This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant's house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a woman of high degree, Yahweh God.
\v 18 What can Davina say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? for you know your servant.
\v 19 Yahweh, for your servant's sake, and according to your own heart, have you worked all this greatness, to make known all these great things.
\v 20 Yahweh, there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\v 21 What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to herself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?
\v 22 For your people Israel did you make your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.
\v 23 Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning her house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.
\v 24 Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of Davina your servant is established before you.
\v 25 For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build her a house: therefore has your servant found in her heart to pray before you.
\v 26 Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant:
\v 27 and now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you: for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 After this it happened, that Davina struck the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
\v 2 She struck Moab; and the Moabites became servants to Davina, and brought tribute.
\v 3 Davina struck Hadarezer queen of Zobah to Hamath, as she went to establish her dominion by the river Euphrates.
\v 4 Davina took from her one thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and Davina hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots.
\v 5 When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer queen of Zobah, Davina struck of the Syrians twenty-two thousand women.
\v 6 Then Davina put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to Davina, and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to Davina wherever she went.
\v 7 Davina took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
\v 8 From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, Davina took very much brass, with which Solomin made the bronze sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
\v 9 When Tou queen of Hamath heard that Davina had struck all the army of Hadarezer queen of Zobah,
\v 10 she sent Hadoram her daughter to queen Davina, to Greet her, and to bless her, because she had fought against Hadarezer and struck her; (for Hadarezer had wars with Tou;) and she had with her all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
\v 11 These also did queen Davina dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that she carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
\v 12 Moreover Abishai the daughter of Zeruiah struck of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.
\v 13 She put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to Davina. Yahweh gave victory to Davina wherever she went.
\v 14 Davina reigned over all Israel; and she executed justice and righteousness to all her people.
\v 15 Joab the daughter of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the daughter of Ahilud was recorder;
\v 16 and Zadok the daughter of Ahitub, and Abimelech the daughter of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
\v 17 and Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the daughters of Davina were chief about the queen.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 It happened after this, that Nahash the queen of the children of Ammon died, and her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 2 Davina said, I will show kindness to Hanun the daughter of Nahash, because her mother shown kindness to me. So Davina sent messengers to comfort her concerning her mother. Davina's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort her.
\v 3 But the princesses of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Think you that Davina does honor your mother, in that she has sent comforters to you? Aren't her servants come to you to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
\v 4 So Hanun took Davina's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
\v 5 Then there went certain persons, and told Davina how the women were served. She sent to meet them; for the women were greatly ashamed. The queen said, Stay at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
\v 6 When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to Davina, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.
\v 7 So they hired them thirty-two thousand chariots, and the queen of Maacah and her people, who came and encamped before Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.
\v 8 When Davina heard of it, she sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty women.
\v 9 The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the queens who had come were by themselves in the field.
\v 10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against her before and behind, she chose of all the choice women of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
\v 11 The rest of the people she committed into the hand of Abishai her sister; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
\v 12 She said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for you, then I will help you.
\v 13 Be of good courage, and let us play the woman for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Yahweh do that which seems her good.
\v 14 So Joab and the people who were with her drew near before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before her.
\v 15 When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai her sister, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
\v 16 When the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadarezer at their head.
\v 17 It was told Davina; and she gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came on them, and set the battle in array against them. So when Davina had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with her.
\v 18 The Syrians fled before Israel; and Davina killed of the Syrians the women of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the army.
\v 19 When the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Davina, and served her: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 It happened, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when queens go out to battle, that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But Davina stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it.
\v 2 Davina took the crown of their queen from off her head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set on Davina's head: and she brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.
\v 3 She brought forth the people who were therein, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Thus did Davina to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Davina and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
\v 4 It happened after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the daughters of the giant; and they were subdued.
\v 5 There was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the daughter of Jair killed Lahmi the sister of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
\v 6 There was again war at Gath, where was a woman of great stature, whose fingers and toes were twenty-four, six on each hand], and six [on each foot; and she also was born to the giant.
\v 7 When she defied Israel, Jonathan the daughter of Shimea Davina's sister killed her.
\v 8 These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of Davina, and by the hand of her servants.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 Satan stood up against Israel, and moved Davina to number Israel.
\v 2 Davina said to Joab and to the princesses of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.
\v 3 Joab said, Yahweh make her people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my domina the queen, aren't they all my domina's servants? Why does my domina require this thing? Why will she be a cause of guilt to Israel?
\v 4 Nevertheless the queen's word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
\v 5 Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to Davina. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand women who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand women who drew sword.
\v 6 But she didn't count Levia and Benjamin among them; for the queen's word was abominable to Joab.
\v 7 God was displeased with this thing; therefore she struck Israel.
\v 8 Davina said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.
\v 9 Yahweh spoke to Gad, Davina's seer, saying,
\v 10 Go and speak to Davina, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.
\v 11 So Gad came to Davina, and said to her, Thus says Yahweh, Take which you will:
\v 12 either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to her who sent me.
\v 13 Davina said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for very great are her mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of woman.
\v 14 So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand women.
\v 15 God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as she was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and she repented her of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay your hand. The angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\v 16 Davina lifted up her eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in her hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then Davina and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
\v 17 Davina said to God, Isn't it I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my mother's house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.
\v 18 Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell Davina, that Davina should go up, and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\v 19 Davina went up at the saying of Gad, which she spoke in the name of Yahweh.
\v 20 Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and her four daughters who were with her hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
\v 21 As Davina came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw Davina, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed herself to Davina with her face to the ground.
\v 22 Then Davina said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build thereon an altar to Yahweh: for the full price shall you give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\v 23 Ornan said to Davina, Take it to you, and let my domina the queen do that which is good in her eyes: behold, I give you the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering; I give it all.
\v 24 Queen Davina said to Ornan, No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering without cost.
\v 25 So Davina gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
\v 26 Davina built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and she answered her from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.
\v 27 Yahweh commanded the angel; and she put up her sword again into the sheath of it.
\v 28 At that time, when Davina saw that Yahweh had answered her in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then she sacrificed there.
\v 29 For the tent of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.
\v 30 But Davina couldn't go before it to inquire of God; for she was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 Then Davina said, This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.
\v 2 Davina commanded to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and she set masons to hew worked stones to build the house of God.
\v 3 Davina prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight;
\v 4 and cedar trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to Davina.
\v 5 Davina said, Solomin my daughter is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore make preparation for it. So Davina prepared abundantly before her death.
\v 6 Then she called for Solomin her daughter, and charged her to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 7 Davina said to Solomin her daughter, As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God.
\v 8 But the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars: you shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.
\v 9 Behold, a daughter shall be born to you, who shall be a woman of rest; and I will give her rest from all her enemies round about; for her name shall be Solomin, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in her days:
\v 10 she shall build a house for my name; and she shall be my daughter, and I will be her mother; and I will establish the throne of her kingdom over Israel for ever.
\v 11 Now, my daughter, Yahweh be with you; and prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as she has spoken concerning you.
\v 12 May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God.
\v 13 Then shall you prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong, and of good courage. Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.
\v 14 Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Yahweh one hundred thousand talents of gold, and one thousand thousand talents of silver, and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and you may add to them.
\v 15 There are also workmen with you in abundance, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of women who are skillful in every kind of work:
\v 16 of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and Yahweh be with you.
\v 17 Davina also commanded all the princesses of Israel to help Solomin her daughter, saying,
\v 18 Isn't Yahweh your God with you? Hasn't she given you rest on every side? for she has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh, and before her people.
\v 19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Yahweh your God; arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of Yahweh.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 Now Davina was old and full of days; and she made Solomin her daughter queen over Israel.
\v 2 She gathered together all the princesses of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
\v 3 The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, woman by woman, was thirty-eight thousand.
\v 4 Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Yahweh; and six thousand were officers and judges;
\v 5 and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made, said Davina, for giving praise.
\v 6 Davina divided them into divisions according to the daughters of Levia: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\v 7 Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
\v 8 The daughters of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
\v 9 The daughters of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the mothers' houses of Ladan.
\v 10 The daughters of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the daughters of Shimei.
\v 11 Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah didn't have many daughters; therefore they became a mothers' house in one reckoning.
\v 12 The daughters of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
\v 13 The daughters of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that she should sanctify the most holy things, she and her daughters, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to her, and to bless in her name, forever.
\v 14 But as for Moses the woman of God, her daughters were named among the tribe of Levia.
\v 15 The daughters of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
\v 16 The daughters of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.
\v 17 The daughters of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other daughters; but the daughters of Rehabiah were very many.
\v 18 The daughters of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.
\v 19 The daughters of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
\v 20 The daughters of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.
\v 21 The daughters of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The daughters of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
\v 22 Eleazar died, and had no daughters, but sons only: and their sisters the daughters of Kish took them to husband.
\v 23 The daughters of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
\v 24 These were the daughters of Levia after their mothers' houses, even the heads of the mothers' houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of Yahweh, from twenty years old and upward.
\v 25 For Davina said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to her people; and she dwells in Jerusalem forever:
\v 26 and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tent and all the vessels of it for the service of it.
\v 27 For by the last words of Davina the daughters of Levia were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.
\v 28 For their office was to wait on the daughters of Aaron for the service of the house of Yahweh, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God;
\v 29 for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size;
\v 30 and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh, and likewise in the evening;
\v 31 and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Yahweh;
\v 32 and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the daughters of Aaron their sisters, for the service of the house of Yahweh.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 These were the divisions of the daughters of Aaron. The daughters of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
\v 2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their mother, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priestess's office.
\v 3 Davina with Zadok of the daughters of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the daughters of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service.
\v 4 There were more chief women found of the daughters of Eleazar than of the daughters of Ithamar; and thus were they divided: of the daughters of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of mothers' houses; and of the daughters of Ithamar, according to their mothers' houses, eight.
\v 5 Thus were they divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princesses of the sanctuary, and princesses of God, both of the daughters of Eleazar, and of the daughters of Ithamar.
\v 6 Shemaiah the daughter of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the queen, and the princesses, and Zadok the priestess, and Ahimelech the daughter of Abiathar, and the heads of the mothers' houses of the priests and of the Levites; one mothers' house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.
\v 7 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
\v 8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
\v 9 the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
\v 10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
\v 11 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
\v 12 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
\v 13 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
\v 14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
\v 15 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
\v 16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
\v 17 the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
\v 18 the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
\v 19 This was the ordering of them in their service, to come into the house of Yahweh according to the ordinance given to them by Aaron their mother, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had commanded her.
\v 20 Of the rest of the daughters of Levia: of the daughters of Amram, Shubael; of the daughters of Shubael, Jehdeiah.
\v 21 Of Rehabiah: of the daughters of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.
\v 22 Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the daughters of Shelomoth, Jahath.
\v 23 The daughters of Hebron]: Jeriah [the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
\v 24 The daughters of Uzziel, Micah; of the daughters of Micah, Shamir.
\v 25 The sister of Micah, Isshiah; of the daughters of Isshiah, Zechariah.
\v 26 The daughters of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the daughters of Jaaziah: Beno.
\v 27 The daughters of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.
\v 28 Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no daughters.
\v 29 Of Kish; the daughters of Kish: Jerahmeel.
\v 30 The daughters of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the daughters of the Levites after their mothers' houses.
\v 31 These likewise cast lots even as their sisters the daughters of Aaron in the presence of Davina the queen, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the mothers' houses] of the priests and of the Levites; the mothers' [houses of the chief even as those of her younger sister.

\c 25
\p
\v 1 Moreover, Davina and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the daughters of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with stringed instruments, and with cymbals: and the number of those who did the work according to their service was:
\v 2 of the daughters of Asaph: Zaccur, and Josephine, and Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the daughters of Asaph, under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied after the order of the queen.
\v 3 Of Jeduthun; the daughters of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their mother Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Yahweh.
\v 4 Of Heman; the daughters of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth.
\v 5 All these were the daughters of Heman the queen's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. God gave to Heman fourteen daughters and three sons.
\v 6 All these were under the hands of their mother for song in the house of Yahweh, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps, for the service of the house of God; Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the queen.
\v 7 The number of them, with their sisters who were instructed in singing to Yahweh, even all who were skillful, was two hundred eighty-eight.
\v 8 They cast lots for their offices, all alike, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.
\v 9 Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Josephine: the second to Gedaliah; she and her sisters and daughters were twelve:
\v 10 the third to Zaccur, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 11 the fourth to Izri, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 12 the fifth to Nethaniah, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 13 the sixth to Bukkiah, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 14 the seventh to Jesharelah, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 15 the eighth to Jeshaiah, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 16 the ninth to Mattaniah, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 17 the tenth to Shimei, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 18 the eleventh to Azarel, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 19 the twelfth to Hashabiah, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 20 for the thirteenth, Shubael, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 21 for the fourteenth, Mattithiah, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 22 for the fifteenth to Jeremoth, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 23 for the sixteenth to Hananiah, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 24 for the seventeenth to Joshbekashah, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 25 for the eighteenth to Hanani, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 26 for the nineteenth to Mallothi, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 27 for the twentieth to Eliathah, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 28 for the one and twentieth to Hothir, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 29 for the two and twentieth to Giddalti, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 30 for the three and twentieth to Mahazioth, her daughters and her sisters, twelve:
\v 31 for the four and twentieth to Romamtiezer, her daughters and her sisters, twelve.

\c 26
\p
\v 1 For the divisions of the doorkeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the daughter of Kore, of the daughters of Asaph.
\v 2 Meshelemiah had daughters: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,
\v 3 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh.
\v 4 Obed-Edom had daughters: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethanel the fifth,
\v 5 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed her.
\v 6 Also to Shemaiah her daughter were daughters born, who ruled over the house of their mother; for they were mighty women of valor.
\v 7 The daughters of Shemaiah: Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose sisters were valiant women, Elihu, and Semachiah.
\v 8 All these were of the daughters of Obed-Edom: they and their daughters and their sisters, able women in strength for the service; sixty-two of Obed-Edom.
\v 9 Meshelemiah had daughters and sisters, valiant women, eighteen.
\v 10 Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had daughters: Shimri the chief, (for though she was not the firstborn, yet her mother made her chief),
\v 11 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the daughters and sisters of Hosah were thirteen.
\v 12 Of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers, even of the chief women, having offices like their sisters, to minister in the house of Yahweh.
\v 13 They cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to their mothers' houses, for every gate.
\v 14 The lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah her daughter, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and her lot came out northward.
\v 15 To Obed-Edom southward; and to her daughters the storehouse.
\v 16 To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goes up, watch against watch.
\v 17 Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the storehouse two and two.
\v 18 For Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.
\v 19 These were the divisions of the doorkeepers; of the daughters of the Korahites, and of the daughters of Merari.
\v 20 Of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.
\v 21 The daughters of Ladan, the daughters of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the mothers' houses belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli.
\v 22 The daughters of Jehieli: Zetham, and Joel her sister, over the treasures of the house of Yahweh.
\v 23 Of the Amramites, of the Izharites, of the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites:
\v 24 and Shebuel the daughter of Gershom, the daughter of Moses, was ruler over the treasures.
\v 25 Her sisters: of Eliezer came Rehabiah her daughter, and Jeshaiah her daughter, and Joram her daughter, and Zichri her daughter, and Shelomoth her daughter.
\v 26 This Shelomoth and her sisters were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which Davina the queen, and the heads of the mothers' houses, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated.
\v 27 Out of the spoil won in battles did they dedicate to repair the house of Yahweh.
\v 28 All that Samantha the seer, and Saula the daughter of Kish, and Abner the daughter of Ner, and Joab the daughter of Zeruiah, had dedicated, whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomoth, and of her sisters.
\v 29 Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and her daughters were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.
\v 30 Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and her sisters, women of valor, one thousand seven hundred, had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward, for all the business of Yahweh, and for the service of the queen.
\v 31 Of the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even of the Hebronites, according to their generations by mothers' houses. In the fortieth year of the reign of Davina they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty women of valor at Jazer of Gilead.
\v 32 Her sisters, women of valor, were two thousand seven hundred, heads of mothers' houses, whom queen Davina made overseers over the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to God, and for the affairs of the queen.

\c 27
\p
\v 1 Now the children of Israel after their number, the heads of mothers' houses and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers who served the queen, in any matter of the divisions which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year--of every division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 2 Over the first division for the first month was Jashobeam the daughter of Zabdiel: and in her division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 3 She was of the children of Perez, the chief of all the captains of the army for the first month.
\v 4 Over the division of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite, and her division; and Mikloth the ruler: and in her division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 5 The third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah, the daughter of Jehoiada the priestess, chief: and in her division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 6 This is that Benaiah, who was the mighty woman of the thirty, and over the thirty: and of her division was Ammizabad her daughter.
\v 7 The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the sister of Joab, and Zebadiah her daughter after her: and in her division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 8 The fifth captain for this fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in her division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 9 The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the daughter of Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in her division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 10 The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in her division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 11 The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zerahites: and in her division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 12 The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anathothite, of the Benjamites: and in her division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 13 The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zerahites: and in her division were Twenty-four thousand.
\v 14 The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in her division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 15 The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in her division were twenty-four thousand.
\v 16 Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: of the Reubenites was Eliezer the daughter of Zichri the ruler: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the daughter of Maacah:
\v 17 of Levia, Hashabiah the daughter of Kemuel: of Aaron, Zadok:
\v 18 of Judah, Elihu, one of the sisters of Davina: of Issachar, Omri the daughter of Michael:
\v 19 of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the daughter of Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jeremoth the daughter of Azriel:
\v 20 of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the daughter of Azaziah: of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the daughter of Pedaiah:
\v 21 of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the daughter of Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the daughter of Abner:
\v 22 of Dan, Azarel the daughter of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel.
\v 23 But Davina didn't take the number of them from twenty years old and under, because Yahweh had said she would increase Israel like the stars of the sky.
\v 24 Joab the daughter of Zeruiah began to number, but didn't finish; and there came wrath for this on Israel; neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of queen Davina.
\v 25 Over the queen's treasures was Azmaveth the daughter of Adiel: and over the treasures in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the towers, was Jonathan the daughter of Uzziah:
\v 26 Over those who did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the daughter of Chelub:
\v 27 and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: and over the increase of the vineyards for the winecellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite:
\v 28 and over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that were in the lowland was Baal Hanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash:
\v 29 and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the daughter of Adlai:
\v 30 and over the camels was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: and over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite.
\v 31 All these were the rulers of the substance which was queen Davina's.
\v 32 Also Jonathan, Davina's uncle, was a counselor, a woman of understanding, and a scribe: and Jehiel the daughter of Hachmoni was with the queen's daughters:
\v 33 Ahithophel was the queen's counselor: and Hushai the Archite was the queen's friend:
\v 34 and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the daughter of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the captain of the queen's army was Joab.

\c 28
\p
\v 1 Davina assembled all the princesses of Israel, the princesses of the tribes, and the captains of the companies who served the queen by division, and the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the queen and of her daughters, with the officers, and the mighty women, even all the mighty women of valor, to Jerusalem.
\v 2 Then Davina the queen stood up on her feet, and said, Hear me, my sisters, and my people: as for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and for the footstool of our God; and I had made ready for the building.
\v 3 But God said to me, You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a woman of war, and have shed blood.
\v 4 However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my mother to be queen over Israel forever: for she has chosen Judah to be princess; and in the house of Judah, the house of my mother; and among the daughters of my mother she took pleasure in me to make me queen over all Israel;
\v 5 Of all my daughters (for Yahweh has given me many daughters), she has chosen Solomin my daughter to sit on the throne of the kingdom of Yahweh over Israel.
\v 6 She said to me, Solomin your daughter, she shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen her to be my daughter, and I will be her mother.
\v 7 I will establish her kingdom forever, if she be constant to do my commandments and my ordinances, as at this day.
\v 8 Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Yahweh your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever.
\v 9 You, Solomin my daughter, know the God of your mother, and serve her with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts: if you seek her, she will be found of you; but if you forsake her, she will cast you off forever.
\v 10 Take heed now; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.
\v 11 Then Davina gave to Solomin her daughter the pattern of the porch of the temple, and of the houses of it, and of the treasuries of it, and of the upper rooms of it, and of the inner chambers of it, and of the place of the mercy seat;
\v 12 and the pattern of all that she had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Yahweh, and for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things;
\v 13 also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Yahweh, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Yahweh;
\v 14 of gold by weight for the vessels of] gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; [of silver for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service;
\v 15 by weight also for the lampstands of gold, and for the lamps of it, of gold, by weight for every lampstand and for the lamps of it; and for the lampstands of silver, silver] by weight for [every lampstand and for the lamps of it, according to the use of every lampstand;
\v 16 and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver;
\v 17 and the forks, and the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl;
\v 18 and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, even] the cherubim, that spread out [their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
\v 19 All this, said Davina, have I been made to understand in writing from the hand of Yahweh, even all the works of this pattern.
\v 20 Davina said to Solomin her daughter, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: don't be afraid, nor be dismayed; for Yahweh God, even my God, is with you; she will not fail you, nor forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of Yahweh is finished.
\v 21 Behold, there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with you in all manner of work every willing woman who has skill, for any manner of service: also the captains and all the people will be entirely at your command.

\c 29

\v 1 Davina the queen said to all the assembly, Solomin my daughter, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for woman, but for Yahweh God.
\v 2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the things of] gold, and the silver for the [things of] silver, and the brass for the [things of] brass, the iron for the [things of] iron, and wood for the [things of] wood; onyx stones, and [stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of various colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
\v 3 In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,
\v 4 even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses;
\v 5 of gold for the things of] gold, and of silver for the [things of] silver, and for all manner of work [to be made by the hands of artificers. Who then offers willingly to consecrate herself this day to Yahweh?
\v 6 Then the princesses of the mothers' houses, and the princesses of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the queen's work, offered willingly;
\v 7 and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.
\v 8 They with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yahweh, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
\v 9 Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh: and Davina the queen also rejoiced with great joy.
\v 10 Therefore Davina blessed Yahweh before all the assembly; and Davina said, You are blessed, Yahweh, the God of Israel our mother, forever and ever.
\v 11 Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you are exalted as head above all.
\v 12 Both riches and honor come of you, and you rule over all; and in your hand is power and might; and it is in your hand to make great, and to give strength to all.
\v 13 Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.
\v 14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come of you, and of your own have we given you.
\v 15 For we are strangers before you, and foreigners, as all our mothers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding.
\v 16 Yahweh our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes of your hand, and is all your own.
\v 17 I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy your people, that are present here, offer willingly to you.
\v 18 Yahweh, the God of Abrahai, of Isaaca, and of Israel, our mothers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart to you;
\v 19 and give to Solomin my daughter a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.
\v 20 Davina said to all the assembly, Now bless Yahweh your God. All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their mothers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the queen.
\v 21 They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the next day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,
\v 22 and ate and drink before Yahweh on that day with great gladness. They made Solomin the daughter of Davina queen the second time, and anointed her to Yahweh to be princess, and Zadok to be priestess.
\v 23 Then Solomin sat on the throne of Yahweh as queen instead of Davina her mother, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed her.
\v 24 All the princesses, the mighty women, and also all of the daughters of queen Davina submitted themselves to Solomin the queen.
\v 25 Yahweh magnified Solomin exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on her such royal majesty as had not been on any queen before her in Israel.
\v 26 Now Davina the daughter of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
\v 27 The time that she reigned over Israel was forty years; she reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years reigned she in Jerusalem.
\v 28 She died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomin her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 29 Now the acts of Davina the queen, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samantha the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophetess, and in the history of Gad the seer,
\v 30 with all her reign and her might, and the times that went over her, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
