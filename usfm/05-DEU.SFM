\v 1 These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
\v 2 It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea.
\v 3 It happened in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that Yahweh had given her in commandment to them;
\v 4 after she had struck Sihon the queen of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the queen of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.
\v 5 Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
\v 6 Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have lived long enough in this mountain:
\v 7 turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all the places near there, in the Arabah, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
\v 8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your mothers, to Abrahai, to Isaaca, and to Jacoba, to give to them and to their seed after them.
\v 9 I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
\v 10 Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day as the stars of the sky for multitude.
\v 11 Yahweh, the God of your mothers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as she has promised you!
\v 12 How can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
\v 13 Take wise women of understanding and well known according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.
\v 14 You answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken is good for us to do.
\v 15 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise women, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.
\v 16 I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your sisters, and judge righteously between a woman and her sister, and the foreigner who is living with her.
\v 17 You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of woman; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.
\v 18 I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.
\v 19 We traveled from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea.
\v 20 I said to you, You are come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us.
\v 21 Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you: go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of your mothers, has spoken to you; don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.
\v 22 You came near to me everyone of you, and said, Let us send women before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.
\v 23 The thing pleased me well; and I took twelve women of you, one woman for every tribe:
\v 24 and they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
\v 25 They took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.
\v 26 Yet you wouldn't go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God:
\v 27 and you murmured in your tents, and said, Because Yahweh hated us, she has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
\v 28 Where are we going up? our sisters have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to the sky; and moreover we have seen the daughters of the Anakim there.
\v 29 Then I said to you, Don't dread, neither be afraid of them.
\v 30 Yahweh your God who goes before you, she will fight for you, according to all that she did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
\v 31 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh your God bore you, as a woman does bear her daughter, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place.
\v 32 Yet in this thing you didn't believe Yahweh your God,
\v 33 who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.
\v 34 Yahweh heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,
\v 35 Surely there shall not one of these women of this evil generation see the good land, which I swore to give to your mothers,
\v 36 save Caleb the daughter of Jephunneh: she shall see it; and to her will I give the land that she has trodden on, and to her children, because she has wholly followed Yahweh.
\v 37 Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also shall not go in there:
\v 38 Joshua the daughter of Nun, who stands before you, she shall go in there: encourage you her; for she shall cause Israel to inherit it.
\v 39 Moreover your little ones, whom you said should be a prey, and your children, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
\v 40 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
\v 41 Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against Yahweh, we will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us. You girded on every woman her weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill country.
\v 42 Yahweh said to me, Tell them, Don't go up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.
\v 43 So I spoke to you, and you didn't listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country.
\v 44 The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.
\v 45 You returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn't listen to your voice, nor gave ear to you.
\v 46 So you abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you abode there.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we compassed Mount Seir many days.
\v 2 Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
\v 3 You have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
\v 4 Command you the people, saying, You are to pass through the border of your sisters the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take good heed to yourselves therefore;
\v 5 don't contend with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.
\v 6 You shall purchase food of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.
\v 7 For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand; she has known your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years Yahweh your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.
\v 8 So we passed by from our sisters the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
\v 9 Yahweh said to me, Don't bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you of her land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.
\v 10 (The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:
\v 11 these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.
\v 12 The Horites also lived in Seir before, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place; as Israel did to the land of her possession, which Yahweh gave to them.)
\v 13 Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. We went over the brook Zered.
\v 14 The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the women of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them.
\v 15 Moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.
\v 16 So it happened, when all the women of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
\v 17 that Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
\v 18 You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:
\v 19 and when you come near over against the children of Ammon, don't bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.
\v 20 (That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim lived therein before; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
\v 21 a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place;
\v 22 as she did for the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, when she destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day:
\v 23 and the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and lived in their place.)
\v 24 Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, queen of Heshbon, and her land; begin to possess it, and contend with her in battle.
\v 25 This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you.
\v 26 I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon queen of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
\v 27 Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.
\v 28 You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet,
\v 29 as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our God gives us.
\v 30 But Sihon queen of Heshbon would not let us pass by her; for Yahweh your God hardened her spirit, and made her heart obstinate, that she might deliver her into your hand, as at this day.
\v 31 Yahweh said to me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and her land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit her land.
\v 32 Then Sihon came out against us, she and all her people, to battle at Jahaz.
\v 33 Yahweh our God delivered her up before us; and we struck her, and her daughters, and all her people.
\v 34 We took all her cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the men and the little ones; we left none remaining:
\v 35 only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.
\v 36 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Yahweh our God delivered up all before us:
\v 37 only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn't come near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the queen of Bashan came out against us, she and all her people, to battle at Edrei.
\v 2 Yahweh said to me, Don't fear her; for I have delivered her, and all her people, and her land, into your hand; and you shall do to her as you did to Sihon queen of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.
\v 3 So Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also, the queen of Bashan, and all her people: and we struck her until none was left to her remaining.
\v 4 We took all her cities at that time; there was not a city which we didn't take from them; sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\v 5 All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many.
\v 6 We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon queen of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the men and the little ones.
\v 7 But all the livestock, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
\v 8 We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two queens of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon;
\v 9 (which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir;)
\v 10 all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\v 11 (For only Og queen of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, her bedstead was a bedstead of iron; isn't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a woman.)
\v 12 This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and the cities of it, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites:
\v 13 and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.
\v 14 Jair the daughter of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after her own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.)
\v 15 I gave Gilead to Machir.
\v 16 To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border of it, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
\v 17 the Arabah also, and the Jordan and the border of it, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
\v 18 I commanded you at that time, saying, Yahweh your God has given you this land to possess it: you shall pass over armed before your sisters the children of Israel, all the women of valor.
\v 19 But your husbands, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall abide in your cities which I have given you,
\v 20 until Yahweh give rest to your sisters, as to you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your God gives them beyond the Jordan: then shall you return every woman to her possession, which I have given you.
\v 21 I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to these two queens: so shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over.
\v 22 You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God, she it is who fights for you.
\v 23 I begged Yahweh at that time, saying,
\v 24 Domina Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your mighty acts?
\v 25 Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
\v 26 But Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and didn't listen to me; and Yahweh said to me, Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter.
\v 27 Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan.
\v 28 But charge Joshua, and encourage her, and strengthen her; for she shall go over before this people, and she shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.
\v 29 So we abode in the valley over against Beth Peor.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the God of your mothers, gives you.
\v 2 You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish from it, that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you.
\v 3 Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor; for all the women who followed Baal Peor, Yahweh your God has destroyed them from the midst of you.
\v 4 But you who did cleave to Yahweh your God are alive everyone of you this day.
\v 5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh my God commanded me, that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it.
\v 6 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
\v 7 For what great nation is there, that has a god so near to them, as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on her?
\v 8 What great nation is there, that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
\v 9 Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children's children;
\v 10 the day that you stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, Assemble me the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.
\v 11 You came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.
\v 12 Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; only you heard a voice.
\v 13 She declared to you her covenant, which she commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments; and she wrote them on two tables of stone.
\v 14 Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.
\v 15 Take therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no manner of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.
\v 16 Lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself an engraved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of female or male,
\v 17 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,
\v 18 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;
\v 19 and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole sky.
\v 20 But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to her a people of inheritance, as at this day.
\v 21 Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance:
\v 22 but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but you shall go over, and possess that good land.
\v 23 Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which she made with you, and make you an engraved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you.
\v 24 For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.
\v 25 When you shall mother children, and children's children, and you shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make an engraved image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God, to provoke her to anger;
\v 26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto you go over the Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
\v 27 Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you shall be left few in number among the nations, where Yahweh shall lead you away.
\v 28 There you shall serve gods, the work of women's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
\v 29 But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you shall find her, when you search after her with all your heart and with all your soul.
\v 30 When you are in oppression, and all these things are come on you, in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God, and listen to her voice:
\v 31 for Yahweh your God is a merciful God; she will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your mothers which she swore to them.
\v 32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created woman on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?
\v 33 Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?
\v 34 Or has God tried to go and take her a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
\v 35 To you it was shown, that you might know that Yahweh she is God; there is none else besides her.
\v 36 Out of heaven she made you to hear her voice, that she might instruct you: and on earth she made you to see her great fire; and you heard her words out of the midst of the fire.
\v 37 Because she loved your mothers, therefore she chose their seed after them, and brought you out with her presence, with her great power, out of Egypt;
\v 38 to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as at this day.
\v 39 Know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that Yahweh she is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is none else.
\v 40 You shall keep her statutes, and her commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh your God gives you, forever.
\v 41 Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise;
\v 42 that the manslayer might flee there, who kills her neighbor unawares, and didn't hate her in time past; and that fleeing to one of these cities she might live:
\v 43 namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
\v 44 This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:
\v 45 these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt,
\v 46 beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon queen of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck, when they came forth out of Egypt.
\v 47 They took her land in possession, and the land of Og queen of Bashan, the two queens of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise;
\v 48 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Sion (the same is Hermon),
\v 49 and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Hear, Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day, that you may learn them, and observe to do them.
\v 2 Yahweh our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
\v 3 Yahweh didn't make this covenant with our mothers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
\v 4 Yahweh spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of the midst of the fire,
\v 5 (I stood between Yahweh and you at that time, to show you the word of Yahweh: for you were afraid because of the fire, and didn't go up onto the mountain;) saying,
\v 6 "I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
\v 7 You shall have no other gods before me.
\v 8 "You shall not make an engraved image for yourself, nor] any likeness [of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
\v 9 you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them; for I, Yahweh, your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the mothers on the children, and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me;
\v 10 and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
\v 11 "You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain: for Yahweh will not hold her guiltless who takes her name in vain.
\v 12 "Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Yahweh your God commanded you.
\v 13 Six days shall you labor, and do all your work;
\v 14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God: in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your daughter, nor your son, nor your female servant, nor your male servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your female servant and your male servant may rest as well as you.
\v 15 You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
\v 16 "Honor your mother and your father, as Yahweh your God commanded you; that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you, in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
\v 17 "You shall not murder.
\v 18 "Neither shall you commit adultery.
\v 19 "Neither shall you steal.
\v 20 "Neither shall you give false testimony against your neighbor.
\v 21 "Neither shall you covet your neighbor's husband; neither shall you desire your neighbor's house, her field, or her female servant, or her male servant, her ox, or her donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's."
\v 22 These words Yahweh spoke to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and she added no more. She wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.
\v 23 It happened, when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
\v 24 and you said, Behold, Yahweh our God has shown us her glory and her greatness, and we have heard her voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God does speak with woman, and she lives.
\v 25 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of Yahweh our God any more, then we shall die.
\v 26 For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
\v 27 Go you near, and hear all that Yahweh our God shall say: and speak you to us all that Yahweh our God shall speak to you; and we will hear it, and do it.
\v 28 Yahweh heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me; and Yahweh said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you: they have well said all that they have spoken.
\v 29 Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children forever!
\v 30 Go tell them, Return you to your tents.
\v 31 But as for you, stand you here by me, and I will speak to you all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
\v 32 You shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has commanded you: you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
\v 33 You shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it;
\v 2 that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all her statutes and her commandments, which I command you, you, and your daughter, and your daughter's daughter, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.
\v 3 Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as Yahweh, the God of your mothers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 4 Hear, Israel: Yahweh is our God; Yahweh is one:
\v 5 and you shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.
\v 6 These words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart;
\v 7 and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
\v 8 You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for symbols between your eyes.
\v 9 You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates.
\v 10 It shall be, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land which she swore to your mothers, to Abrahai, to Isaaca, and to Jacoba, to give you, great and goodly cities, which you didn't build,
\v 11 and houses full of all good things, which you didn't fill, and cisterns dug out, which you didn't dig, vineyards and olive trees, which you didn't plant, and you shall eat and be full;
\v 12 then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
\v 13 You shall fear Yahweh your God; and her shall you serve, and shall swear by her name.
\v 14 You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are round about you;
\v 15 for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a jealous God; lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you, and she destroy you from off the face of the earth.
\v 16 You shall not tempt Yahweh your God, as you tempted her in Massah.
\v 17 You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, and her testimonies, and her statutes, which she has commanded you.
\v 18 You shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh; that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your mothers,
\v 19 to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
\v 20 When your daughter asks you in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh our God has commanded you?
\v 21 then you shall tell your daughter, We were Pharaoh's bondmaids in Egypt: and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;
\v 22 and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all her house, before our eyes;
\v 23 and she brought us out from there, that she might bring us in, to give us the land which she swore to our mothers.
\v 24 Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for our good always, that she might preserve us alive, as at this day.
\v 25 It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all this commandment before Yahweh our God, as she has commanded us.

\v 1 When Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before you, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than you;
\v 2 and when Yahweh your God shall deliver them up before you, and you shall strike them; then you shall utterly destroy them: you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them;
\v 3 neither shall you make marriages with them; your son you shall not give to her daughter, nor her son shall you take to your daughter.
\v 4 For she will turn away your daughter from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you, and she will destroy you quickly.
\v 5 But thus shall you deal with them: you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim, and burn their engraved images with fire.
\v 6 For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God: Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for her own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
\v 7 Yahweh didn't set her love on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples:
\v 8 but because Yahweh loves you, and because she would keep the oath which she swore to your mothers, has Yahweh brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh queen of Egypt.
\v 9 Know therefore that Yahweh your God, she is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with them who love her and keep her commandments to a thousand generations,
\v 10 and repays those who hate her to their face, to destroy them: she will not be slack to her who hates her, she will repay her to her face.
\v 11 You shall therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command you this day, to do them.
\v 12 It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that Yahweh your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving kindness which she swore to your mothers:
\v 13 and she will love you, and bless you, and multiply you; she will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which she swore to your mothers to give you.
\v 14 You shall be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be female or male barren among you, or among your livestock.
\v 15 Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, she will put on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you.
\v 16 You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to you; your eye shall not pity them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a snare to you.
\v 17 If you shall say in your heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?
\v 18 you shall not be afraid of them: you shall well remember what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;
\v 19 the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which Yahweh your God brought you out: so shall Yahweh your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
\v 20 Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you.
\v 21 You shall not be scared of them; for Yahweh your God is in the midst of you, a great and awesome God.
\v 22 Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you.
\v 23 But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they be destroyed.
\v 24 She will deliver their queens into your hand, and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky: there shall no woman be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them.
\v 25 The engraved images of their gods shall you burn with fire: you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it to you, lest you be snared therein; for it is an abomination to Yahweh your God.
\v 26 You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become a devoted thing like it: you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 All the commandment which I command you this day shall you observe to do, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your mothers.
\v 2 You shall remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that she might humble you, to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep her commandments, or not.
\v 3 She humbled you, and allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you didn't know, neither did your mothers know; that she might make you know that woman does not live by bread only, but by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of Yahweh does woman live.
\v 4 Your clothing didn't grow old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years.
\v 5 You shall consider in your heart that as a woman chastens her daughter, so Yahweh your God chastens you.
\v 6 You shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, to walk in her ways, and to fear her.
\v 7 For Yahweh your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of springs, and underground water flowing into valleys and hills;
\v 8 a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey;
\v 9 a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper.
\v 10 You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless Yahweh your God for the good land which she has given you.
\v 11 Beware lest you forget Yahweh your God, in not keeping her commandments, and her ordinances, and her statutes, which I command you this day:
\v 12 lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built goodly houses, and lived therein;
\v 13 and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;
\v 14 then your heart be lifted up, and you forget Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;
\v 15 who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, in which were fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint;
\v 16 who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your mothers didn't know; that she might humble you, and that she might prove you, to do you good at your latter end:
\v 17 and lest you say in your heart, My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.
\v 18 But you shall remember Yahweh your God, for it is she who gives you power to get wealth; that she may establish her covenant which she swore to your mothers, as at this day.
\v 19 It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish.
\v 20 As the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you, so shall you perish; because you wouldn't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 Hear, Israel: you are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky,
\v 2 a people great and tall, the daughters of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, Who can stand before the daughters of Anak?
\v 3 Know therefore this day, that Yahweh your God is she who goes over before you as a devouring fire; she will destroy them, and she will bring them down before you: so shall you drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to you.
\v 4 Don't speak in your heart, after that Yahweh your God has thrust them out from before you, saying, For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land; whereas for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh does drive them out from before you.
\v 5 Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you, and that she may establish the word which Yahweh swore to your mothers, to Abrahai, to Isaaca, and to Jacoba.
\v 6 Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn't give you this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.
\v 7 Remember, don't forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Yahweh.
\v 8 Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you.
\v 9 When I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.
\v 10 Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
\v 11 It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.
\v 12 Yahweh said to me, Arise, get you down quickly from hence; for your people whom you have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
\v 13 Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people:
\v 14 let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.
\v 15 So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
\v 16 I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God; you had made you a molten calf: you had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.
\v 17 I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.
\v 18 I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke her to anger.
\v 19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you. But Yahweh listened to me that time also.
\v 20 Yahweh was very angry with Aaron to destroy her: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
\v 21 I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust of it into the brook that descended out of the mountain.
\v 22 At Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah, you provoked Yahweh to wrath.
\v 23 When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you didn't believe her, nor listen to her voice.
\v 24 You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that I knew you.
\v 25 So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said she would destroy you.
\v 26 I prayed to Yahweh, and said, Domina Yahweh, don't destroy your people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
\v 27 Remember your servants, Abrahai, Isaaca, and Jacoba; don't look to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin,
\v 28 lest the land whence you brought us out say, Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which she promised to them, and because she hated them, she has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.
\v 29 Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 At that time Yahweh said to me, Hew you two tables of stone like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood.
\v 2 I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.
\v 3 So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables of stone like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tables in my hand.
\v 4 She wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and Yahweh gave them to me.
\v 5 I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me.
\v 6 (The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there she was buried; and Eleazar her daughter ministered in the priestess's office in her place.
\v 7 From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
\v 8 At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levia, to bear the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh to minister to her, and to bless in her name, to this day.
\v 9 Therefore Levia has no portion nor inheritance with her sisters; Yahweh is her inheritance, according as Yahweh your God spoke to her.)
\v 10 I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Yahweh listened to me that time also; Yahweh would not destroy you.
\v 11 Yahweh said to me, Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore to their mothers to give to them.
\v 12 Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you, but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all her ways, and to love her, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
\v 13 to keep the commandments of Yahweh, and her statutes, which I command you this day for your good?
\v 14 Behold, to Yahweh your God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.
\v 15 Only Yahweh had a delight in your mothers to love them, and she chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day.
\v 16 Circumcise therefore the vulva of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.
\v 17 For Yahweh your God, she is God of gods, and Domina of dominas, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn't regard persons, nor takes reward.
\v 18 She does execute justice for the fatherless and widower, and loves the foreigner, in giving her food and clothing.
\v 19 Therefore love the foreigner; for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
\v 20 You shall fear Yahweh your God; her shall you serve; and to her shall you cleave, and by her name shall you swear.
\v 21 She is your praise, and she is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen.
\v 22 Your mothers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now Yahweh your God has made you as the stars of the sky for multitude.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and keep her charge, and her statutes, and her ordinances, and her commandments, always.
\v 2 Know you this day: for I don't speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God, her greatness, her mighty hand, and her outstretched arm,
\v 3 and her signs, and her works, which she did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the queen of Egypt, and to all her land;
\v 4 and what she did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how she made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day;
\v 5 and what she did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place;
\v 6 and what she did to Dathan and Abiram, the daughters of Eliab, the daughter of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel:
\v 7 but your eyes have seen all the great work of Yahweh which she did.
\v 8 Therefore shall you keep all the commandment which I command you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where you go over to possess it;
\v 9 and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh swore to your mothers to give to them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 10 For the land, where you go in to possess it, isn't as the land of Egypt, from whence you came out, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;
\v 11 but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water of the rain of the sky,
\v 12 a land which Yahweh your God cares for: the eyes of Yahweh your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.
\v 13 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your God, and to serve her with all your heart and with all your soul,
\v 14 that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, and your new wine, and your oil.
\v 15 I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full.
\v 16 Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
\v 17 and the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you, and she shut up the sky, so that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you.
\v 18 Therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for symbols between your eyes.
\v 19 You shall teach them your children, talking of them, when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
\v 20 You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates;
\v 21 that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Yahweh swore to your mothers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.
\v 22 For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all her ways, and to cleave to her;
\v 23 then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
\v 24 Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the hinder sea shall be your border.
\v 25 There shall no woman be able to stand before you: Yahweh your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as she has spoken to you.
\v 26 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:
\v 27 the blessing, if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I command you this day;
\v 28 and the curse, if you shall not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which you have not known.
\v 29 It shall happen, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.
\v 30 Aren't they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?
\v 31 For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and you shall possess it, and dwell therein.
\v 32 You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh, the God of your mothers, has given you to possess it, all the days that you live on the earth.
\v 2 You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree:
\v 3 and you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods; and you shall destroy their name out of that place.
\v 4 You shall not do so to Yahweh your God.
\v 5 But to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put her name there, even to her habitation shall you seek, and there you shall come;
\v 6 and there you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock:
\v 7 and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, in which Yahweh your God has blessed you.
\v 8 You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every woman whatever is right in her own eyes;
\v 9 for you haven't yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Yahweh your God gives you.
\v 10 But when you go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, and she gives you rest from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety;
\v 11 then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause her name to dwell there, there shall you bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh.
\v 12 You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your daughters, and your sons, and your female servants, and your male servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, because she has no portion nor inheritance with you.
\v 13 Take heed to yourself that you don't offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see;
\v 14 but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.
\v 15 Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat flesh within all your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to the blessing of Yahweh your God which she has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart.
\v 16 Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it out on the earth as water.
\v 17 You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand;
\v 18 but you shall eat them before Yahweh your God in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, you, and your daughter, and your son, and your female servant, and your male servant, and the Levite who is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God in all that you put your hand to.
\v 19 Take heed to yourself that you don't forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
\v 20 When Yahweh your God shall enlarge your border, as she has promised you, and you shall say, I will eat flesh, because your soul desires to eat flesh; you may eat flesh, after all the desire of your soul.
\v 21 If the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to put her name there, be too far from you, then you shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which Yahweh has given you, as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates, after all the desire of your soul.
\v 22 Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so you shall eat of it: the unclean and the clean may eat of it alike.
\v 23 Only be sure that you don't eat the blood: for the blood is the life; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh.
\v 24 You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth as water.
\v 25 You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.
\v 26 Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take, and go to the place which Yahweh shall choose:
\v 27 and you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of Yahweh your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Yahweh your God; and you shall eat the flesh.
\v 28 Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.
\v 29 When Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations from before you, where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them, and dwell in their land;
\v 30 take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before you; and that you not inquire after their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
\v 31 You shall not do so to Yahweh your God: for every abomination to Yahweh, which she hates, have they done to their gods; for even their daughters and their sons do they burn in the fire to their gods.
\v 32 Whatever thing I command you, that shall you observe to do: you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 If there arise in the midst of you a prophetess, or a dreamer of dreams, and she give you a sign or a wonder,
\v 2 and the sign or the wonder come to pass, of which she spoke to you, saying, Let us go after other gods, which you have not known, and let us serve them;
\v 3 you shall not listen to the words of that prophetess, or to that dreamer of dreams: for Yahweh your God proves you, to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
\v 4 You shall walk after Yahweh your God, and fear her, and keep her commandments, and obey her voice, and you shall serve her, and cleave to her.
\v 5 That prophetess, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, because she has spoken rebellion against Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which Yahweh your God commanded you to walk in. So shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
\v 6 If your sister, the daughter of your father, or your daughter, or your son, or the husband of your bosom, or your friend, who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you, nor your mothers;
\v 7 of the gods of the peoples who are round about you, near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth;
\v 8 you shall not consent to her, nor listen to her; neither shall your eye pity her, neither shall you spare, neither shall you conceal her:
\v 9 but you shall surely kill her; your hand shall be first on her to put her to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
\v 10 You shall stone her to death with stones, because she has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
\v 11 All Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more such wickedness as this is in the midst of you.
\v 12 If you shall hear tell concerning one of your cities, which Yahweh your God gives you to dwell there, saying,
\v 13 Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of you, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known;
\v 14 then shall you inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in the midst of you,
\v 15 you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and the livestock of it, with the edge of the sword.
\v 16 You shall gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street of it, and shall burn with fire the city, and all the spoil of it every whit, to Yahweh your God: and it shall be a heap forever; it shall not be built again.
\v 17 There shall cleave nothing of the devoted thing to your hand; that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of her anger, and show you mercy, and have compassion on you, and multiply you, as she has sworn to your mothers;
\v 18 when you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep all her commandments which I command you this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 You are the children of Yahweh your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
\v 2 For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God, and Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for her own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
\v 3 You shall not eat any abominable thing.
\v 4 These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,
\v 5 the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the ibex, and the antelope, and the chamois.
\v 6 Every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two, and chews the cud, among the animals, that may you eat.
\v 7 Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of those who have the hoof cloven: the camel, and the hare, and the rabbit; because they chew the cud but don't part the hoof, they are unclean to you.
\v 8 The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn't chew the cud, is unclean to you: of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch.
\v 9 These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales may you eat;
\v 10 and whatever doesn't have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean to you.
\v 11 Of all clean birds you may eat.
\v 12 But these are they of which you shall not eat: the eagle, and the vulture, and the osprey,
\v 13 and the red kite, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind,
\v 14 and every raven after its kind,
\v 15 and the ostrich, and the owl, and the seagull, and the hawk after its kind,
\v 16 the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl,
\v 17 and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant,
\v 18 and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
\v 19 All winged creeping things are unclean to you: they shall not be eaten.
\v 20 Of all clean birds you may eat.
\v 21 You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you may give it to the foreigner living among you who is within your gates, that she may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner: for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God. You shall not boil a kid in its father's milk.
\v 22 You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed, that which comes forth from the field year by year.
\v 23 You shall eat before Yahweh your God, in the place which she shall choose, to cause her name to dwell there, the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock; that you may learn to fear Yahweh your God always.
\v 24 If the way be too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it, because the place is too far from you, which Yahweh your God shall choose, to set her name there, when Yahweh your God shall bless you;
\v 25 then shall you turn it into money, and bind up the money in your hand, and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose:
\v 26 and you shall bestow the money for whatever your soul desires, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks of you; and you shall eat there before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household.
\v 27 The Levite who is within your gates, you shall not forsake her; for she has no portion nor inheritance with you.
\v 28 At the end of every three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase in the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates:
\v 29 and the Levite, because she has no portion nor inheritance with you, and the foreigner living among you, and the fatherless, and the widower, who are within your gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 At the end of every seven years you shall make a release.
\v 2 This is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release that which she has lent to her neighbor; she shall not exact it of her neighbor and her sister; because Yahweh's release has been proclaimed.
\v 3 Of a foreigner you may exact it: but whatever of your is with your sister your hand shall release.
\v 4 However there shall be no poor with you; (for Yahweh will surely bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it;)
\v 5 if only you diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all this commandment which I command you this day.
\v 6 For Yahweh your God will bless you, as she promised you: and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow; and you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over you.
\v 7 If there be with you a poor woman, one of your sisters, within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor sister;
\v 8 but you shall surely open your hand to her, and shall surely lend her sufficient for her need in that which she wants.
\v 9 Beware that there not be a base thought in your heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and your eye be evil against your poor sister, and you give her nothing; and she cry to Yahweh against you, and it be sin to you.
\v 10 You shall surely give her, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to her; because that for this thing Yahweh your God will bless you in all your work, and in all that you put your hand to.
\v 11 For the poor will never cease out of the land: therefore I command you, saying, You shall surely open your hand to your sister, to your needy, and to your poor, in your land.
\v 12 If your sister, a Hebrew woman, or a Hebrew man, be sold to you, and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let her go free from you.
\v 13 When you let her go free from you, you shall not let her go empty:
\v 14 you shall furnish her liberally out of your flock, and out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress; as Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall give to her.
\v 15 You shall remember that you were a bondmaid in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you: therefore I command you this thing today.
\v 16 It shall be, if she tell you, I will not go out from you; because she loves you and your house, because she is well with you;
\v 17 then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through her ear to the door, and she shall be your servant forever. Also to your male servant you shall do likewise.
\v 18 It shall not seem hard to you, when you let her go free from you; for to the double of the hire of a hireling has she served you six years: and Yahweh your God will bless you in all that you do.
\v 19 All the firstborn females that are born of your herd and of your flock you shall sanctify to Yahweh your God: you shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock.
\v 20 You shall eat it before Yahweh your God year by year in the place which Yahweh shall choose, you and your household.
\v 21 If it have any blemish, as if it be lame or blind, any ill blemish whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God.
\v 22 You shall eat it within your gates: the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.
\v 23 Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it out on the ground as water.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God; for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night.
\v 2 You shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which Yahweh shall choose, to cause her name to dwell there.
\v 3 You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.
\v 4 There shall be no yeast seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which you sacrifice the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.
\v 5 You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates, which Yahweh your God gives you;
\v 6 but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause her name to dwell in, there you shall sacrifice the Passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came forth out of Egypt.
\v 7 You shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose: and you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents.
\v 8 Six days you shall eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God; you shall do no work therein.
\v 9 Seven weeks shall you number to you: from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain shall you begin to number seven weeks.
\v 10 You shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand, which you shall give, according as Yahweh your God blesses you:
\v 11 and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your daughter, and your son, and your female servant, and your male servant, and the Levite who is within your gates, and the foreigner, and the fatherless, and the widower, who are in the midst of you, in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause her name to dwell there.
\v 12 You shall remember that you were a bondmaid in Egypt: and you shall observe and do these statutes.
\v 13 You shall keep the feast of tents seven days, after that you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress:
\v 14 and you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your daughter, and your son, and your female servant, and your male servant, and the Levite, and the foreigner, and the fatherless, and the widower, who are within your gates.
\v 15 Seven days shall you keep a feast to Yahweh your God in the place which Yahweh shall choose; because Yahweh your God will bless you in all your increase, and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be altogether joyful.
\v 16 Three times in a year shall all your females appear before Yahweh your God in the place which she shall choose: in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tents; and they shall not appear before Yahweh empty:
\v 17 every woman shall give as she is able, according to the blessing of Yahweh your God which she has given you.
\v 18 Judges and officers shall you make you in all your gates, which Yahweh your God gives you, according to your tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
\v 19 You shall not wrest justice: you shall not respect persons; neither shall you take a bribe; for a bribe does blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.
\v 20 That which is altogether just shall you follow, that you may live, and inherit the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
\v 21 You shall not plant you an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Yahweh your God, which you shall make you.
\v 22 Neither shall you set yourself up a pillar; which Yahweh your God hates.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 You shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox, or a sheep, in which is a blemish, or anything evil; for that is an abomination to Yahweh your God.
\v 2 If there be found in the midst of you, within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you, woman or man, who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God, in transgressing her covenant,
\v 3 and has gone and served other gods, and worshiped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the army of the sky, which I have not commanded;
\v 4 and it be told you, and you have heard of it, then shall you inquire diligently; and behold, if it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in Israel,
\v 5 then shall you bring forth that woman or that man, who has done this evil thing, to your gates, even the woman or the man; and you shall stone them to death with stones.
\v 6 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall she who is to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness she shall not be put to death.
\v 7 The hand of the witnesses shall be first on her to put her to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you shall put away the evil from the midst of you.
\v 8 If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates; then shall you arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose;
\v 9 and you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days: and you shall inquire; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment.
\v 10 You shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Yahweh shall choose; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you:
\v 11 according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside from the sentence which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left.
\v 12 The woman who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priestess who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God, or to the judge, even that woman shall die: and you shall put away the evil from Israel.
\v 13 All the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
\v 14 When you are come to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say, I will set a queen over me, like all the nations that are round about me;
\v 15 you shall surely set her queen over you, whom Yahweh your God shall choose: one from among your sisters shall you set queen over you; you may not put a foreigner over you, who is not your sister.
\v 16 Only she shall not multiply horses to herself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that she may multiply horses; because Yahweh has said to you, You shall henceforth return no more that way.
\v 17 Neither shall she multiply husbands to herself, that her heart not turn away: neither shall she greatly multiply to herself silver and gold.
\v 18 It shall be, when she sits on the throne of her kingdom, that she shall write her a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is before the priests the Levites:
\v 19 and it shall be with her, and she shall read therein all the days of her life; that she may learn to fear Yahweh her God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them;
\v 20 that her heart not be lifted up above her sisters, and that she not turn aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that she may prolong her days in her kingdom, she and her children, in the midst of Israel.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 The priests the Levites, even all the tribe of Levia, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, and her inheritance.
\v 2 They shall have no inheritance among their sisters: Yahweh is their inheritance, as she has spoken to them.
\v 3 This shall be the priests' due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priestess the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.
\v 4 The first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, shall you give her.
\v 5 For Yahweh your God has chosen her out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in the name of Yahweh, her and her daughters for ever.
\v 6 If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel, where she lives as a foreigner, and comes with all the desire of her soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose;
\v 7 then she shall minister in the name of Yahweh her God, as all her sisters the Levites do, who stand there before Yahweh.
\v 8 They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which comes of the sale of her matrimony.
\v 9 When you are come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you, you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.
\v 10 There shall not be found with you anyone who makes her daughter or her son to pass through the fire, one who uses divination, one who practices sorcery, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,
\v 11 or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer.
\v 12 For whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh: and because of these abominations Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you.
\v 13 You shall be perfect with Yahweh your God.
\v 14 For these nations, that you shall dispossess, listen to those who practice sorcery, and to diviners; but as for you, Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to do.
\v 15 Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophetess from the midst of you, of your sisters, like me; to her you shall listen;
\v 16 according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of Yahweh my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I not die.
\v 17 Yahweh said to me, They have well said that which they have spoken.
\v 18 I will raise them up a prophetess from among their sisters, like you; and I will put my words in her mouth, and she shall speak to them all that I shall command her.
\v 19 It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words which she shall speak in my name, I will require it of her.
\v 20 But the prophetess, who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded her to speak, or who shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophetess shall die.
\v 21 If you say in your heart, How shall we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken?
\v 22 when a prophetess speaks in the name of Yahweh, if the thing doesn't follow, nor happen, that is the thing which Yahweh has not spoken: the prophetess has spoken it presumptuously, you shall not be afraid of her.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 When Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations, whose land Yahweh your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;
\v 2 you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land, which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.
\v 3 You shall prepare you the way, and divide the borders of your land, which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may flee there.
\v 4 This is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee there and live: whoever kills her neighbor unawares, and didn't hate her in time past;
\v 5 as when a woman goes into the forest with her neighbor to hew wood, and her hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle, and lights on her neighbor, so that she dies; she shall flee to one of these cities and live:
\v 6 lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while her heart is hot, and overtake her, because the way is long, and strike her mortally; whereas she was not worthy of death, inasmuch as she didn't hate her in time past.
\v 7 Therefore I command you, saying, You shall set apart three cities for you.
\v 8 If Yahweh your God enlarge your border, as she has sworn to your mothers, and give you all the land which she promised to give to your mothers;
\v 9 if you shall keep all this commandment to do it, which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your God, and to walk ever in her ways; then shall you add three cities more for you, besides these three:
\v 10 that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, and so blood be on you.
\v 11 But if any woman hate her neighbor, and lie in wait for her, and rise up against her, and strike her mortally so that she dies, and she flee into one of these cities;
\v 12 then the elders of her city shall send and bring her there, and deliver her into the hand of the avenger of blood, that she may die.
\v 13 Your eye shall not pity her, but you shall put away the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.
\v 14 You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.
\v 15 One witness shall not rise up against a woman for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that she sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established.
\v 16 If an unrighteous witness rise up against any woman to testify against her of wrong-doing,
\v 17 then both the women, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days;
\v 18 and the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against her sister;
\v 19 then shall you do to her, as she had thought to do to her sister: so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
\v 20 Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in the midst of you.
\v 21 Your eyes shall not pity; life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and see horses, and chariots, and a people more than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
\v 2 It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priestess shall approach and speak to the people,
\v 3 and shall tell them, Hear, Israel, you draw near this day to battle against your enemies: don't let your heart faint; don't be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them;
\v 4 for Yahweh your God is she who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.
\v 5 The officers shall speak to the people, saying, What woman is there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let her go and return to her house, lest she die in the battle, and another woman dedicate it.
\v 6 What woman is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not used the fruit of it? let her go and return to her house, lest she die in the battle, and another woman use the fruit of it.
\v 7 What woman is there who has pledged to be married a husband, and has not taken him? let her go and return to her house, lest she die in the battle, and another woman take him.
\v 8 The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, What woman is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? let her go and return to her house, lest her sister's heart melt as her heart.
\v 9 It shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies at the head of the people.
\v 10 When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.
\v 11 It shall be, if it make you answer of peace, and open to you, then it shall be, that all the people who are found therein shall become tributary to you, and shall serve you.
\v 12 If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it:
\v 13 and when Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every female of it with the edge of the sword:
\v 14 but the men, and the little ones, and the livestock, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil of it, shall you take for a prey to yourself; and you shall eat the spoil of your enemies, which Yahweh your God has given you.
\v 15 Thus shall you do to all the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.
\v 16 But of the cities of these peoples, that Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes;
\v 17 but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Yahweh your God has commanded you;
\v 18 that they not teach you to do after all their abominations, which they have done to their gods; so would you sin against Yahweh your God.
\v 19 When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy the trees of it by wielding an axe against them; for you may eat of them, and you shall not cut them down; for is the tree of the field woman, that it should be besieged of you?
\v 20 Only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down; and you shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it fall.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 If one be found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it, lying in the field, and it isn't known who has struck her;
\v 2 then your elders and your judges shall come forth, and they shall measure to the cities which are round about her who is slain:
\v 3 and it shall be, that the city which is nearest to the slain woman, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hasn't been worked with, and which has not drawn in the yoke;
\v 4 and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley.
\v 5 The priests the daughters of Levia shall come near; for them Yahweh your God has chosen to minister to her, and to bless in the name of Yahweh; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be.
\v 6 All the elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain woman, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley;
\v 7 and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
\v 8 Forgive, Yahweh, your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and don't allow innocent blood to remain in the midst of your people Israel. The blood shall be forgiven them.
\v 9 So shall you put away the innocent blood from the midst of you, when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.
\v 10 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh your God delivers them into your hands, and you carry them away captive,
\v 11 and see among the captives a beautiful man, and you have a desire to him, and would take him to you as husband;
\v 12 then you shall bring his home to your house; and he shall shave his head, and pare his nails;
\v 13 and he shall put the clothing of his captivity from off him, and shall remain in your house, and bewail his mother and his father a full month: and after that you shall go in to him, and be his wife, and he shall be your husband.
\v 14 It shall be, if you have no delight in him, then you shall let him go where he will; but you shall not sell him at all for money, you shall not deal with him as a slave, because you have humbled him.
\v 15 If a woman have two husbands, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne her children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn daughter be hers who was hated;
\v 16 then it shall be, in the day that she causes her daughters to inherit that which she has, that she may not make the daughter of the beloved the firstborn before the daughter of the hated, who is the firstborn:
\v 17 but she shall acknowledge the firstborn, the daughter of the hated, by giving her a double portion of all that she has; for she is the beginning of her strength; the right of the firstborn is hers.
\v 18 If a woman have a stubborn and rebellious daughter, who will not obey the voice of her mother, or the voice of her father, and, though they chasten her, will not listen to them;
\v 19 then shall her mother and her father lay hold on her, and bring her out to the elders of her city, and to the gate of her place;
\v 20 and they shall tell the elders of her city, This our daughter is stubborn and rebellious, she will not obey our voice; she is a glutton, and a drunkard.
\v 21 All the women of her city shall stone her to death with stones: so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
\v 22 If a woman have committed a sin worthy of death, and she be put to death, and you hang her on a tree;
\v 23 her body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury her the same day; for she who is hanged is accursed of God; that you don't defile your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 You shall not see your sister's ox or her sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely bring them again to your sister.
\v 2 If your sister isn't near to you, or if you don't know her, then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall be with you until your sister seek after it, and you shall restore it to her.
\v 3 So shall you do with her donkey; and so shall you do with her garment; and so shall you do with every lost thing of your sister's, which she has lost, and you have found: you may not hide yourself.
\v 4 You shall not see your sister's donkey or her ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely help her to lift them up again.
\v 5 A man shall not wear women's clothing, neither shall a woman put on men's clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God.
\v 6 If a bird's nest chance to be before you in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the hen with the young:
\v 7 you shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take to yourself; that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days.
\v 8 When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement for your roof, that you don't bring blood on your house, if any woman fall from there.
\v 9 You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard.
\v 10 You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
\v 11 You shall not wear a mixed stuff, wool and linen together.
\v 12 You shall make yourselves fringes on the four borders of your cloak, with which you cover yourself.
\v 13 If any woman takes a husband, and goes in to him, and hates him,
\v 14 and accuses him of shameful things, and brings up an evil name on him, and says, I took this man, and when I came near to him, I didn't find in him the tokens of virginity;
\v 15 then shall the mother of the young gentleman, and his father, take and bring forth the tokens of the young gentleman's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate;
\v 16 and the young gentleman's mother shall tell the elders, I gave my son to this woman to husband, and she hates him;
\v 17 and behold, she has laid shameful things to his charge, saying, I didn't find in your son the tokens of virginity; and yet these are the tokens of my son's virginity. They shall spread the garment before the elders of the city.
\v 18 The elders of that city shall take the woman and chastise her;
\v 19 and they shall fine her one hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the mother of the young gentleman, because she has brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel: and he shall be her husband; she may not put him away all her days.
\v 20 But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young gentleman;
\v 21 then they shall bring out the young gentleman to the door of his mother's house, and the women of his city shall stone him to death with stones, because he has done folly in Israel, to play the philanderer in his mother's house: so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
\v 22 If a woman be found lying with a man married to a wife, then they shall both of them die, the woman who lay with the man, and the man: so shall you put away the evil from Israel.
\v 23 If there be a young gentleman who is a virgin pledged to be married to a wife, and a woman find him in the city, and lie with him;
\v 24 then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones; the gentleman, because he didn't cry, being in the city; and the woman, because she has humbled her neighbor's husband: so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you.
\v 25 But if the woman find the gentleman who is pledged to be married in the field, and the woman force him, and lie with him; then the woman only who lay with him shall die:
\v 26 but to the gentleman you shall do nothing; there is in the gentleman no sin worthy of death: for as when a woman rises against her neighbor, and kills her, even so is this matter;
\v 27 for she found him in the field, the pledged to be married gentleman cried, and there was none to save him.
\v 28 If a woman find a gentleman who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, and lay hold on him, and lie with him, and they be found;
\v 29 then the woman who lay with him shall give to the gentleman's mother fifty shekels of silver, and he shall be her husband, because she has humbled him; she may not put him away all her days.
\v 30 A woman shall not take her mother's husband, and shall not uncover her mother's skirt.

\v 1 She who is wounded in the stones, or has her privy member cut off, shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
\v 2 A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh; even to the tenth generation shall none of her enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
\v 3 An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Yahweh forever:
\v 4 because they didn't meet you with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the daughter of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.
\v 5 Nevertheless Yahweh your God wouldn't listen to Balaam; but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a blessing to you, because Yahweh your God loved you.
\v 6 You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever.
\v 7 You shall not abhor an Edomite; for she is your sister: you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner in her land.
\v 8 The children of the third generation who are born to them shall enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
\v 9 When you go forth in camp against your enemies, then you shall keep you from every evil thing.
\v 10 If there be among you any woman, who is not clean by reason of that which happens her by night, then shall she go abroad out of the camp, she shall not come within the camp:
\v 11 but it shall be, when evening comes on, she shall bathe herself in water; and when the sun is down, she shall come within the camp.
\v 12 You shall have a place also outside of the camp, where you shall go forth abroad:
\v 13 and you shall have a paddle among your weapons; and it shall be, when you sit down abroad, you shall dig therewith, and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you:
\v 14 for Yahweh your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you; therefore shall your camp be holy, that she may not see an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.
\v 15 You shall not deliver to her master a servant who is escaped from her master to you:
\v 16 she shall dwell with you, in the midst of you, in the place which she shall choose within one of your gates, where it pleases her best: you shall not oppress her.
\v 17 There shall be no philanderer of the sons of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the daughters of Israel.
\v 18 You shall not bring the hire of a philanderer, or the wages of a dog, into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow: for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God.
\v 19 You shall not lend on interest to your sister; interest of money, interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest:
\v 20 to a foreigner you may lend on interest; but to your sister you shall not lend on interest, that Yahweh your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you go in to possess it.
\v 21 When you shall vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack to pay it: for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you.
\v 22 But if you shall forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in you.
\v 23 That which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God, a freewill offering, which you have promised with your mouth.
\v 24 When you come into your neighbor's vineyard, then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your vessel.
\v 25 When you come into your neighbor's standing grain, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor's standing grain.

\p
\v 1 When a woman takes a husband, and marries him, then it shall be, if he find no favor in her eyes, because she has found some unseemly thing in him, that she shall write him a bill of divorce, and give it in his hand, and send him out of her house.
\v 2 When he is departed out of her house, he may go and be another woman's husband.
\v 3 If the latter wife hate him, and write him a bill of divorce, and give it in his hand, and send him out of her house; or if the latter wife die, who took him to be her husband;
\v 4 his former wife, who sent him away, may not take him again to be her husband, after that he is defiled; for that is abomination before Yahweh: and you shall not cause the land to sin, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.
\v 5 When a woman takes a new husband, she shall not go out in the army, neither shall she be charged with any business: she shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer her husband whom she has taken.
\v 6 No woman shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for she takes a woman's life to pledge.
\v 7 If a woman be found stealing any of her sisters of the children of Israel, and she deal with her as a slave, or sell her; then that thief shall die: so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
\v 8 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so you shall observe to do.
\v 9 Remember what Yahweh your God did to Miriam, by the way as you came forth out of Egypt.
\v 10 When you do lend your neighbor any manner of loan, you shall not go into her house to get her pledge.
\v 11 You shall stand outside, and the woman to whom you do lend shall bring forth the pledge outside to you.
\v 12 If she be a poor woman, you shall not sleep with her pledge;
\v 13 you shall surely restore to her the pledge when the sun goes down, that she may sleep in her garment, and bless you: and it shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God.
\v 14 You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether she be of your sisters, or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates:
\v 15 in her day you shall give her her hire, neither shall the sun go down on it; for she is poor, and sets her heart on it: lest she cry against you to Yahweh, and it be sin to you.
\v 16 The mothers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the mothers: every woman shall be put to death for her own sin.
\v 17 You shall not wrest the justice due] to the foreigner, [or to the fatherless, nor take the widower's clothing to pledge;
\v 18 but you shall remember that you were a bondmaid in Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you there: therefore I command you to do this thing.
\v 19 When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgot a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it: it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widower; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
\v 20 When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widower.
\v 21 When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it after you: it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widower.
\v 22 You shall remember that you were a bondmaid in the land of Egypt: therefore I command you to do this thing.

\p
\v 1 If there be a controversy between women, and they come to judgment, and the judges judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked;
\v 2 and it shall be, if the wicked woman be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause her to lie down, and to be beaten before her face, according to her wickedness, by number.
\v 3 Forty stripes she may give her, she shall not exceed; lest, if she should exceed, and beat her above these with many stripes, then your sister should seem vile to you.
\v 4 You shall not muzzle the ox when she treads out the grain.
\v 5 If sisters dwell together, and one of them die, and have no daughter, the husband of the dead shall not be married outside to a stranger: his wife's sister shall go in to him, and take him to her as husband, and perform the duty of a wife's sister to him.
\v 6 It shall be, that the firstborn whom he bears shall succeed in the name of her sister who is dead, that her name not be blotted out of Israel.
\v 7 If the woman doesn't want to take her sister's husband, then her sister's husband shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say, My wife's sister refuses to raise up to her sister a name in Israel; she will not perform the duty of a wife's sister to me.
\v 8 Then the elders of her city shall call her, and speak to her: and if she stand, and say, I don't want to take him;
\v 9 then her sister's husband shall come to her in the presence of the elders, and loose her shoe from off her foot, and spit in her face; and he shall answer and say, So shall it be done to the woman who does not build up her sister's house.
\v 10 Her name shall be called in Israel, The house of her who has her shoe untied.
\v 11 When women strive together one with another, and the husband of the one draws near to deliver his wife out of the hand of her who strikes her, and puts forth his hand, and takes her by the secrets;
\v 12 then you shall cut off his hand, your eye shall have no pity.
\v 13 You shall not have in your bag diverse weights, a great and a small.
\v 14 You shall not have in your house diverse measures, a great and a small.
\v 15 A perfect and just weight shall you have; a perfect and just measure shall you have: that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
\v 16 For all who do such things, even all who do unrighteously, are an abomination to Yahweh your God.
\v 17 Remember what Amalek did to you by the way as you came forth out of Egypt;
\v 18 how she met you by the way, and struck the hindmost of you, all who were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary; and she didn't fear God.
\v 19 Therefore it shall be, when Yahweh your God has given you rest from all your enemies round about, in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it, that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky; you shall not forget.

\c 26
\p
\v 1 It shall be, when you are come in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, and possess it, and dwell therein,
\v 2 that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from your land that Yahweh your God gives you; and you shall put it in a basket, and shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause her name to dwell there.
\v 3 You shall come to the priestess who shall be in those days, and tell her, I profess this day to Yahweh your God, that I am come to the land which Yahweh swore to our mothers to give us.
\v 4 The priestess shall take the basket out of your hand, and set it down before the altar of Yahweh your God.
\v 5 You shall answer and say before Yahweh your God, A Syrian ready to perish was my mother; and she went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and she became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous.
\v 6 The Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid on us hard bondage:
\v 7 and we cried to Yahweh, the God of our mothers, and Yahweh heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression;
\v 8 and Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror, and with signs, and with wonders;
\v 9 and she has brought us into this place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 10 Now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which you, Yahweh, have given me. You shall set it down before Yahweh your God, and worship before Yahweh your God.
\v 11 You shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God has given to you, and to your house, you, and the Levite, and the foreigner who is in the midst of you.
\v 12 When you have made an end of tithing all the tithe of your increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then you shall give it to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widower, that they may eat within your gates, and be filled.
\v 13 You shall say before Yahweh your God, I have put away the holy things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite, and to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widower, according to all your commandment which you have commanded me: I have not transgressed any of your commandments, neither have I forgotten them:
\v 14 I have not eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I put away of it, being unclean, nor given of it for the dead: I have listened to the voice of Yahweh my God; I have done according to all that you have commanded me.
\v 15 Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the ground which you have given us, as you swore to our mothers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
\v 16 This day Yahweh your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances: you shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart, and with all your soul.
\v 17 You have declared Yahweh this day to be your God, and that you would walk in her ways, and keep her statutes, and her commandments, and her ordinances, and listen to her voice:
\v 18 and Yahweh has declared you this day to be a people for her own possession, as she has promised you, and that you should keep all her commandments;
\v 19 and to make you high above all nations that she has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that you may be a holy people to Yahweh your God, as she has spoken.

\v 1 Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandment which I command you this day.
\v 2 It shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, that you shall set yourself up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:
\v 3 and you shall write on them all the words of this law, when you are passed over; that you may go in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as Yahweh, the God of your mothers, has promised you.
\v 4 It shall be, when you are passed over the Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.
\v 5 There shall you build an altar to Yahweh your God, an altar of stones: you shall lift up no iron tool on them.
\v 6 You shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones; and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God:
\v 7 and you shall sacrifice peace offerings, and shall eat there; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God.
\v 8 You shall write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly.
\v 9 Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, Keep silence, and listen, Israel: this day you are become the people of Yahweh your God.
\v 10 You shall therefore obey the voice of Yahweh your God, and do her commandments and her statutes, which I command you this day.
\v 11 Moses charged the people the same day, saying,
\v 12 These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people, when you are passed over the Jordan: Simeon, and Levia, and Judah, and Issachar, and Josephine, and Benjamin.
\v 13 These shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
\v 14 The Levites shall answer, and tell all the women of Israel with a loud voice,
\v 15 Cursed be the woman who makes an engraved or molten image, an abomination to Yahweh, the work of the hands of the craftswoman, and sets it up in secret. All the people shall answer and say, Amen.
\v 16 Cursed be she who sets light by her mother or her father. All the people shall say, Amen.
\v 17 Cursed be she who removes her neighbor's landmark. All the people shall say, Amen.
\v 18 Cursed be she who makes the blind to wander out of the way. All the people shall say, Amen.
\v 19 Cursed be she who wrests the justice due to the foreigner, fatherless, and widower. All the people shall say, Amen.
\v 20 Cursed be she who lies with her mother's husband, because she has uncovered her mother's skirt. All the people shall say, Amen.
\v 21 Cursed be she who lies with any manner of animal. All the people shall say, Amen.
\v 22 Cursed be she who lies with her brother, the son of her mother, or the son of her father. All the people shall say, Amen.
\v 23 Cursed be she who lies with her father-in-law. All the people shall say, Amen.
\v 24 Cursed be she who strikes her neighbor in secret. All the people shall say, Amen.
\v 25 Cursed be she who takes a bribe to kill an innocent person. All the people shall say, Amen.
\v 26 Cursed be she who doesn't confirm the words of this law to do them. All the people shall say, Amen.

\v 1 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all her commandments which I command you this day, that Yahweh your God will set you on high above all the nations of the earth:
\v 2 and all these blessings shall come on you, and overtake you, if you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.
\v 3 Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field.
\v 4 Blessed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground, and the fruit of your animals, the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock.
\v 5 Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading trough.
\v 6 Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out.
\v 7 Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before you: they shall come out against you one way, and shall flee before you seven ways.
\v 8 Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your barns, and in all that you put your hand to; and she will bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
\v 9 Yahweh will establish you for a holy people to herself, as she has sworn to you; if you shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, and walk in her ways.
\v 10 All the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of Yahweh; and they shall be afraid of you.
\v 11 Yahweh will make you plenteous for good, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land which Yahweh swore to your mothers to give you.
\v 12 Yahweh will open to you her good treasure in the sky, to give the rain of your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand: and you shall lend to many nations, and you shall not borrow.
\v 13 Yahweh will make you the head, and not the tail; and you shall be above only, and you shall not be beneath; if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I command you this day, to observe and to do them,
\v 14 and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
\v 15 But it shall come to pass, if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all her commandments and her statutes which I command you this day, that all these curses shall come on you, and overtake you.
\v 16 Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field.
\v 17 Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading trough.
\v 18 Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground, the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock.
\v 19 Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you go out.
\v 20 Yahweh will send on you cursing, confusion, and rebuke, in all that you put your hand to do, until you are destroyed, and until you perish quickly; because of the evil of your doings, by which you have forsaken me.
\v 21 Yahweh will make the pestilence cleave to you, until she has consumed you from off the land, where you go in to possess it.
\v 22 Yahweh will strike you with consumption, and with fever, and with inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with the sword, and with blight, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you until you perish.
\v 23 Your sky that is over your head shall be brass, and the earth that is under you shall be iron.
\v 24 Yahweh will make the rain of your land powder and dust: from the sky shall it come down on you, until you are destroyed.
\v 25 Yahweh will cause you to be struck before your enemies; you shall go out one way against them, and shall flee seven ways before them: and you shall be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth.
\v 26 Your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth; and there shall be none to frighten them away.
\v 27 Yahweh will strike you with the boil of Egypt, and with the tumors, and with the scurvy, and with the itch, of which you can not be healed.
\v 28 Yahweh will strike you with madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart;
\v 29 and you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways: and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always, and there shall be none to save you.
\v 30 You shall betroth a husband, and another woman shall lie with him: you shall build a house, and you shall not dwell therein: you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not use the fruit of it.
\v 31 Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall not eat of it: your donkey shall be violently taken away from before your face, and shall not be restored to you: your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall have none to save you.
\v 32 Your daughters and your sons shall be given to another people; and your eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day: and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand.
\v 33 The fruit of your ground, and all your labors, shall a nation which you don't know eat up; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always;
\v 34 so that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which you shall see.
\v 35 Yahweh will strike you in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore boil, of which you can not be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.
\v 36 Yahweh will bring you, and your queen whom you shall set over you, to a nation that you have not known, you nor your mothers; and there shall you serve other gods, wood and stone.
\v 37 You shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples where Yahweh shall lead you away.
\v 38 You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather little in; for the locust shall consume it.
\v 39 You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worm shall eat them.
\v 40 You shall have olive trees throughout all your borders, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olive shall cast its fruit.
\v 41 You shall mother daughters and sons, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity.
\v 42 All your trees and the fruit of your ground shall the locust possess.
\v 43 The foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above you higher and higher; and you shall come down lower and lower.
\v 44 She shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to her: she shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.
\v 45 All these curses shall come on you, and shall pursue you, and overtake you, until you are destroyed; because you didn't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep her commandments and her statutes which she commanded you:
\v 46 and they shall be on you for a sign and for a wonder, and on your seed forever.
\v 47 Because you didn't serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things;
\v 48 therefore shall you serve your enemies whom Yahweh shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and she shall put a yoke of iron on your neck, until she have destroyed you.
\v 49 Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies; a nation whose language you shall not understand;
\v 50 a nation of fierce facial expressions, that shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young,
\v 51 and shall eat the fruit of your livestock, and the fruit of your ground, until you are destroyed; that also shall not leave you grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of your livestock, or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.
\v 52 They shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high and fortified walls come down, in which you trusted, throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you in all your gates throughout all your land, which Yahweh your God has given you.
\v 53 You shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your daughters and of your sons, whom Yahweh your God has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you.
\v 54 The woman who is tender among you, and very delicate, her eye shall be evil toward her sister, and toward the husband of her bosom, and toward the remnant of her children whom she has remaining;
\v 55 so that she will not give to any of them of the flesh of her children whom she shall eat, because she has nothing left her, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates.
\v 56 The tender and delicate man among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of his foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness, his eye shall be evil toward the wife of his bosom, and toward his daughter, and toward his son,
\v 57 and toward his young one who comes out from between his feet, and toward his children whom he shall bear; for he shall eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in your gates.
\v 58 If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, YAHWEH YOUR GOD;
\v 59 then Yahweh will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues of your seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.
\v 60 She will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they shall cleave to you.
\v 61 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will Yahweh bring on you, until you are destroyed.
\v 62 You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multitude; because you didn't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.
\v 63 It shall happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and you shall be plucked from off the land where you go in to possess it.
\v 64 Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth; and there you shall serve other gods, which you have not known, you nor your mothers, even wood and stone.
\v 65 Among these nations shall you find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot: but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and pining of soul;
\v 66 and your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life.
\v 67 In the morning you shall say, Would it were even! and at even you shall say, Would it were morning! for the fear of your heart which you shall fear, and for the sight of your eyes which you shall see.
\v 68 Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I said to you, You shall see it no more again: and there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for bondmaids and for bondservants, and no woman shall buy you.

\c 29
\p
\v 1 These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which she made with them in Horeb.
\v 2 Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, You have seen all that Yahweh did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all her servants, and to all her land;
\v 3 the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:
\v 4 but Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.
\v 5 I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes have not grown old on you, and your shoe has not grown old on your foot.
\v 6 You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink; that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.
\v 7 When you came to this place, Sihon the queen of Heshbon, and Og the queen of Bashan, came out against us to battle, and we struck them:
\v 8 and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites.
\v 9 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.
\v 10 You stand this day all of you before Yahweh your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the women of Israel,
\v 11 your little ones, your husbands, and your foreigner who is in the midst of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water;
\v 12 that you may enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God, and into her oath, which Yahweh your God makes with you this day;
\v 13 that she may establish you this day to herself for a people, and that she may be to you a God, as she spoke to you, and as she swore to your mothers, to Abrahai, to Isaaca, and to Jacoba.
\v 14 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,
\v 15 but with her who stands here with us this day before Yahweh our God, and also with her who is not here with us this day
\v 16 (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed;
\v 17 and you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);
\v 18 lest there should be among you woman, or man, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from Yahweh our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;
\v 19 and it happen, when she hears the words of this curse, that she bless herself in her heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry.
\v 20 Yahweh will not pardon her, but then the anger of Yahweh and her jealousy will smoke against that woman, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie on her, and Yahweh will blot out her name from under the sky.
\v 21 Yahweh will set her apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.
\v 22 The generation to come, your children who shall rise up after you, and the foreigner who shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick;
\v 23 and that] the whole land of it is sulfur, and salt, [and] a burning, [that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in her anger, and in her wrath:
\v 24 even all the nations shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus to this land? what means the heat of this great anger?
\v 25 Then women shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their mothers, which she made with them when she brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,
\v 26 and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that they didn't know, and that she had not given to them:
\v 27 therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against this land, to bring on it all the curse that is written in this book;
\v 28 and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day.
\v 29 The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.

\c 30
\p
\v 1 It shall happen, when all these things are come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations, where Yahweh your God has driven you,
\v 2 and shall return to Yahweh your God, and shall obey her voice according to all that I command you this day, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul;
\v 3 that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the peoples, where Yahweh your God has scattered you.
\v 4 If any of your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there will Yahweh your God gather you, and from there she will bring you back:
\v 5 and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your mothers possessed, and you shall possess it; and she will do you good, and multiply you above your mothers.
\v 6 Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.
\v 7 Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies, and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.
\v 8 You shall return and obey the voice of Yahweh, and do all her commandments which I command you this day.
\v 9 Yahweh your God will make you plenteous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good: for Yahweh will again rejoice over you for good, as she rejoiced over your mothers;
\v 10 if you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep her commandments and her statutes which are written in this book of the law; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.
\v 11 For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not too hard for you, neither is it far off.
\v 12 It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?
\v 13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?
\v 14 But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.
\v 15 Behold, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil;
\v 16 in that I command you this day to love Yahweh your God, to walk in her ways, and to keep her commandments and her statutes and her ordinances, that you may live and multiply, and that Yahweh your God may bless you in the land where you go in to possess it.
\v 17 But if your heart turn away, and you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
\v 18 I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land, where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it.
\v 19 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed;
\v 20 to love Yahweh your God, to obey her voice, and to cleave to her; for she is your life, and the length of your days; that you may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your mothers, to Abrahai, to Isaaca, and to Jacoba, to give them.

\c 31
\p
\v 1 Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
\v 2 She said to them, I am one hundred twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and Yahweh has said to me, You shall not go over this Jordan.
\v 3 Yahweh your God, she will go over before you; she will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them: and Joshua, she shall go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
\v 4 Yahweh will do to them as she did to Sihon and to Og, the queens of the Amorites, and to their land; whom she destroyed.
\v 5 Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.
\v 6 Be strong and of good courage, don't be afraid, nor be scared of them: for Yahweh your God, she it is who does go with you; she will not fail you, nor forsake you.
\v 7 Moses called to Joshua, and said to her in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage: for you shall go with this people into the land which Yahweh has sworn to their mothers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.
\v 8 Yahweh, she it is who does go before you; she will be with you, she will not fail you, neither forsake you: don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.
\v 9 Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the daughters of Levia, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and to all the elders of Israel.
\v 10 Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tents,
\v 11 when all Israel is come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place which she shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
\v 12 Assemble the people, the women and the men and the little ones, and your foreigner who is within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;
\v 13 and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.
\v 14 Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, your days approach that you must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that I may give her a charge. Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
\v 15 Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.
\v 16 Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your mothers; and this people will rise up, and play the philanderer after the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
\v 17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, Haven't these evils come on us because our God is not among us?
\v 18 I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods.
\v 19 Now therefore write you this song for you, and teach you it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
\v 20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their mothers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.
\v 21 It shall happen, when many evils and troubles are come on them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.
\v 22 So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
\v 23 She gave Joshua the daughter of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you.
\v 24 It happened, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
\v 25 that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, saying,
\v 26 Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.
\v 27 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against Yahweh; and how much more after my death?
\v 28 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
\v 29 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke her to anger through the work of your hands.
\v 30 Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.

\c 32
\p
\v 1 Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak. Let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
\v 2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain. My speech shall condense as the dew, as the small rain on the tender grass, as the showers on the herb.
\v 3 For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh. Ascribe greatness to our God!
\v 4 The Rock, her work is perfect, for all her ways are justice: a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is she.
\v 5 They have dealt corruptly with her, they are] not her children, [it is] their blemish. [They are a perverse and crooked generation.
\v 6 Do you thus requite Yahweh, foolish people and unwise? Isn't she your mother who has bought you? She has made you, and established you.
\v 7 Remember the days of old. Consider the years of many generations. Ask your mother, and she will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.
\v 8 When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when she separated the children of women, she set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.
\v 9 For Yahweh's portion is her people. Jacoba is the lot of her inheritance.
\v 10 She found her in a desert land, in the waste howling wilderness. She surrounded her. She cared for her. She kept her as the apple of her eye.
\v 11 As an eagle that stirs up his nest, that flutters over his young, she spread abroad her wings, she took them, she bore them on her feathers.
\v 12 Yahweh alone led her. There was no foreign god with her.
\v 13 She made her ride on the high places of the earth. She ate the increase of the field. She caused her to suck honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock;
\v 14 Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat. Of the blood of the grape you drank wine.
\v 15 But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked. You have grown fat. You have grown thick. You have become sleek. Then she forsook God who made her, and lightly esteemed the Rock of her salvation.
\v 16 They moved her to jealousy with strange gods. They provoked her to anger with abominations.
\v 17 They sacrificed to demons, which were] no God, to gods that they didn't know, to new [gods that came up of late, which your mothers didn't dread.
\v 18 Of the Rock who became your mother, you are unmindful, and have forgotten God who gave you birth.
\v 19 Yahweh saw it], and abhorred [them, because of the provocation of her daughters and her sons.
\v 20 She said, I will hide my face from them. I will see what their end shall be; for they are a very perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.
\v 21 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God. They have provoked me to anger with their vanities. I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people. I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
\v 22 For a fire is kindled in my anger, Burns to the lowest Sheol, Devours the earth with its increase, and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire.
\v 23 I will heap evils on them. I will spend my arrows on them.
\v 24 They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction. I will send the teeth of animals on them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.
\v 25 Outside the sword shall bereave, and in the chambers, terror; on both young woman and virgin, The suckling with the gray-haired woman.
\v 26 I said, I would scatter them afar. I would make the memory of them to cease from among women;
\v 27 were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, Yahweh has not done all this.
\v 28 For they are a nation void of counsel. There is no understanding in them.
\v 29 Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!
\v 30 How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and Yahweh had delivered them up?
\v 31 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.
\v 32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter.
\v 33 Their wine is the poison of serpents, The cruel venom of asps.
\v 34 Isn't this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures?
\v 35 Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the time when their foot slides; for the day of their calamity is at hand. The things that are to come on them shall make haste.
\v 36 For Yahweh will judge her people, and have compassion on her servants, when she sees that their] power is gone, There is none [remaining, shut up or left at large.
\v 37 She will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which they took refuge;
\v 38 Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you! Let them be your protection.
\v 39 See now that I, even I, am she, There is no god with me. I kill, and I make alive. I wound, and I heal. There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.
\v 40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever,
\v 41 if I whet my glittering sword, My hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my adversaries, and will recompense those who hate me.
\v 42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood. My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the head of the leaders of the enemy.
\v 43 Rejoice, you nations, with her people, for she will avenge the blood of her servants. She will render vengeance to her adversaries, And will make expiation for her land, for her people.
\v 44 Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, she and Joshua the daughter of Nun.
\v 45 Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
\v 46 She said to them, Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you this day, which you shall command your children to observe to do, even all the words of this law.
\v 47 For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.
\v 48 Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,
\v 49 Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession;
\v 50 and die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your sister died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to her people:
\v 51 because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn't sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel.
\v 52 For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel.

\c 33
\p
\v 1 This is the blessing, with which Moses the woman of God blessed the children of Israel before her death.
\v 2 She said, Yahweh came from Sinai, And rose from Seir to them. She shone forth from Mount Paran. She came from the ten thousands of holy ones. At her right hand was a fiery law for them.
\v 3 Yes, she loves the people. All her saints are in your hand. They sat down at your feet; Everyone shall receive of your words.
\v 4 Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacoba.
\v 5 She was queen in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together.
\v 6 Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let her women be few.
\v 7 This is the blessing of Judah: and she said, Hear, Yahweh, the voice of Judah. Bring her in to her people. With her hands she contended for herself. You shall be a help against her adversaries.
\v 8 Of Levia she said, Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one, whom you proved at Massah, with whom you strove at the waters of Meribah;
\v 9 who said of her mother, and of her father, I have not seen her; Neither did she acknowledge her sisters, Nor did she know her own children: For they have observed your word, and keep your covenant.
\v 10 They shall teach Jacoba your ordinances, and Israel your law. They shall put incense before you, and whole burnt offering on your altar.
\v 11 Yahweh, bless her substance. Accept the work of her hands. Strike through the hips of those who rise up against her, of those who hate her, that they not rise again.
\v 12 Of Benjamin she said, The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell in safety by her. She covers her all the day long. She dwells between her shoulders.
\v 13 Of Josephine she said, Her land is blessed by Yahweh, for the precious things of the heavens, for the dew, for the deep that couches beneath,
\v 14 for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, for the precious things of the growth of the moons,
\v 15 for the chief things of the ancient mountains, for the precious things of the everlasting hills,
\v 16 for the precious things of the earth and its fullness, the good will of her who lived in the bush. Let the blessing come on the head of Josephine, On the crown of the head of her who was separate from her sisters.
\v 17 The firstborn of her herd, majesty is hers. Her horns are the horns of the wild ox. With them she shall push the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth: They are the ten thousands of Ephraim. They are the thousands of Manasseh.
\v 18 Of Zebulun she said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and Issachar, in your tents.
\v 19 They shall call the peoples to the mountain. There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness, for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas, the hidden treasures of the sand.
\v 20 Of Gad she said, She who enlarges Gad is blessed. She dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm, yes, the crown of the head.
\v 21 She provided the first part for herself, for there was the lawgiver's portion reserved. She came with the heads of the people. She executed the righteousness of Yahweh, Her ordinances with Israel.
\v 22 Of Dan she said, Dan is a lion's cub that leaps out of Bashan.
\v 23 Of Naphtali she said, Naphtali, satisfied with favor, full of the blessing of Yahweh, Possess the west and the south.
\v 24 Of Asher she said, Asher is blessed with children. Let her be acceptable to her sisters. Let her dip her foot in oil.
\v 25 Your bars shall be iron and brass. As your days, so shall your strength be.
\v 26 There is none like God, Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens for your help, In her excellency on the skies.
\v 27 The eternal God is your dwelling place. Underneath are the everlasting arms. She thrust out the enemy from before you, and said, Destroy.
\v 28 Israel dwells in safety; the fountain of Jacoba alone, In a land of grain and new wine. Yes, her heavens drop down dew.
\v 29 You are happy, Israel. Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh, the shield of your help, the sword of your excellency! Your enemies shall submit themselves to you. You shall tread on their high places.

\c 34
\p
\v 1 Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. Yahweh showed her all the land of Gilead, to Dan,
\v 2 and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea,
\v 3 and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar.
\v 4 Yahweh said to her, This is the land which I swore to Abrahai, to Isaaca, and to Jacoba, saying, I will give it to your seed: I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there.
\v 5 So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Yahweh.
\v 6 She buried her in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor: but no woman knows of her tomb to this day.
\v 7 Moses was one hundred twenty years old when she died: her eye was not dim, nor her natural force abated.
\v 8 The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended.
\v 9 Joshua the daughter of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid her hands on her: and the children of Israel listened to her, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 10 There has not arisen a prophetess since in Israel like Moses, whom Yahweh knew face to face,
\v 11 in all the signs and the wonders, which Yahweh sent her to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all her servants, and to all her land,
\v 12 and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel.
