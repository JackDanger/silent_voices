\v 1 The words of Jeremia the daughter of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
\v 2 to whom the word of Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the daughter of Amon, queen of Judah, in the thirteenth year of her reign.
\v 3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the daughter of Josiah, queen of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the daughter of Josiah, queen of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
\v 4 Now the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 5 Before I formed you in the belly I knew you, and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you; I have appointed you a prophetess to the nations.
\v 6 Then said I, Ah, Domina Yahweh! behold, I don't know how to speak; for I am a child.
\v 7 But Yahweh said to me, Don't say, I am a child; for to whoever I shall send you, you shall go, and whatever I shall command you, you shall speak.
\v 8 Don't be afraid because of them; for I am with you to deliver you, says Yahweh.
\v 9 Then Yahweh put forth her hand, and touched my mouth; and Yahweh said to me, Behold, I have put my words in your mouth:
\v 10 behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.
\v 11 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, Jeremia, what see you? I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
\v 12 Then said Yahweh to me, You have well seen: for I watch over my word to perform it.
\v 13 The word of Yahweh came to me the second time, saying, What see you? I said, I see a boiling caldron; and the face of it is from the north.
\v 14 Then Yahweh said to me, Out of the north evil shall break forth on all the inhabitants of the land.
\v 15 For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Yahweh; and they shall come, and they shall set everyone her throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls of it round about, and against all the cities of Judah.
\v 16 I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.
\v 17 You therefore gird up your waist, and arise, and speak to them all that I command you: don't be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them.
\v 18 For, behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the queens of Judah, against the princesses of it, against the priests of it, and against the people of the land.
\v 19 They shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you: for I am with you, says Yahweh, to deliver you.

\p
\v 1 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 2 Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I remember for you the kindness of your youth, the love of your weddings; how you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.
\v 3 Israel was holiness to Yahweh, the first fruits of her increase: all who devour her shall be held guilty; evil shall come on them, says Yahweh.
\v 4 Hear you the word of Yahweh, O house of Jacoba, and all the families of the house of Israel:
\v 5 thus says Yahweh, What unrighteousness have your mothers found in me, that they have gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?
\v 6 Neither said they, Where is Yahweh who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed through, and where no woman lived?
\v 7 I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit of it and the goodness of it; but when you entered, you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.
\v 8 The priests didn't say, Where is Yahweh? and those who handle the law didn't know me: the rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.
\v 9 Therefore I will yet contend with you, says Yahweh, and with your children's children will I contend.
\v 10 For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there has been such a thing.
\v 11 Has a nation changed its gods, which yet are no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
\v 12 Be astonished, you heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be you very desolate, says Yahweh.
\v 13 For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
\v 14 Is Israel a servant? is she a native-born slave? why is she become a prey?
\v 15 The young lions have roared on her, and yelled; and they have made her land waste: her cities are burned up, without inhabitant.
\v 16 The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.
\v 17 Haven't you procured this to yourself, in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God, when she led you by the way?
\v 18 Now what have you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? or what have you to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?
\v 19 Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding shall reprove you: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that you have forsaken Yahweh your God, and that my fear is not in you, says the Domina, Yahweh of Armies.
\v 20 For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds; and you said, I will not serve; for on every high hill and under every green tree you did bow yourself, playing the philanderer.
\v 21 Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?
\v 22 For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me, says the Domina Yahweh.
\v 23 How can you say, I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Baals? see your way in the valley, know what you have done: you are a swift dromedary traversing his ways;
\v 24 a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind in his desire; in his occasion who can turn him away? all those who seek his will not weary themselves; in his month they shall find him.
\v 25 Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, It is in vain; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.
\v 26 As the thief is ashamed when she is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their queens, their princesses, and their priests, and their prophets;
\v 27 who tell a stock, You are my mother; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back to me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
\v 28 But where are your gods that you have made you? let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah.
\v 29 Why will you contend with me? you all have transgressed against me, says Yahweh.
\v 30 In vain have I struck your children; they received no correction: your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
\v 31 Generation, see the word of Yahweh. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? or a land of thick darkness? why say my people, We are broken loose; we will come no more to you?
\v 32 Can a virgin forget his ornaments, or a bridegroom his attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
\v 33 How trimmest you your way to seek love! therefore even the wicked men have you taught your ways.
\v 34 Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: you did not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things.
\v 35 Yet you said, I am innocent; surely her anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with you, because you say, I have not sinned.
\v 36 Why go you about so much to change your way? you shall be ashamed of Egypt also, as you were ashamed of Assyria.
\v 37 From there also shall you go forth, with your hands on your head: for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust, and you shall not prosper with them.

\v 1 They say, If a woman put away her husband, and he go from her, and become another woman's, will she return to him again? Won't that land be greatly polluted? But you have played the philanderer with many lovers; yet return again to me, says Yahweh.
\v 2 Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see; where have you not been lain with? By the ways have you sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness.
\v 3 Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; yet you have a philanderer's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.
\v 4 Will you not from this time cry to me, My Mother, you are the guide of my youth?
\v 5 Will she retain her anger forever? will she keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way.
\v 6 Moreover Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the queen, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? he is gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the philanderer.
\v 7 I said after he had done all these things, He will return to me; but he didn't return: and his treacherous brother Judah saw it.
\v 8 I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put him away and given him a bill of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, his brother, didn't fear; but he also went and played the philanderer.
\v 9 It happened through the lightness of his prostitution, that the land was polluted, and he committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
\v 10 Yet for all this his treacherous brother Judah has not returned to me with his whole heart, but only in pretense, says Yahweh.
\v 11 Yahweh said to me, Backsliding Israel has shown himself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
\v 12 Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, says Yahweh; I will not look in anger on you; for I am merciful, says Yahweh, I will not keep anger forever.
\v 13 Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed my voice, says Yahweh.
\v 14 Return, backsliding children, says Yahweh; for I am a wife to you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:
\v 15 and I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
\v 16 It shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says Yahweh, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Yahweh; neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they remember it; neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more.
\v 17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Yahweh; and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
\v 18 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your mothers.
\v 19 But I said, How I will put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations! and I said, You shall call me My Mother, and shall not turn away from following me.
\v 20 Surely as a husband treacherously departs from his wife, so have you dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel, says Yahweh.
\v 21 A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their God.
\v 22 Return, you backsliding children, I will heal your backsliding. Behold, we are come to you; for you are Yahweh our God.
\v 23 Truly in vain is the help that is looked for from the hills, the tumult on the mountains: truly in Yahweh our God is the salvation of Israel.
\v 24 But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our mothers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their daughters and their sons.
\v 25 Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Yahweh our God, we and our mothers, from our youth even to this day; and we have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God.

\p
\v 1 If you will return, Israel, says Yahweh, if you will return to me, and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight; then you shall not be removed;
\v 2 and you shall swear, As Yahweh lives, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in her, and in her shall they glory.
\v 3 For thus says Yahweh to the women of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and don't sow among thorns.
\v 4 Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you women of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
\v 5 Declare you in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow you the trumpet in the land: cry aloud and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.
\v 6 Set up a standard toward Zion: flee for safety, don't stay; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.
\v 7 A lion is gone up from her thicket, and a destroyer of nations; she is on her way, she is gone forth from her place, to make your land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.
\v 8 For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn't turned back from us.
\v 9 It shall happen at that day, says Yahweh, that the heart of the queen shall perish, and the heart of the princesses; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
\v 10 Then said I, Ah, Domina Yahweh! surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace; whereas the sword reaches to the life.
\v 11 At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the son of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;
\v 12 a full wind from these shall come for me: now will I also utter judgments against them.
\v 13 Behold, she shall come up as clouds, and her chariots shall be as the whirlwind: her horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! for we are ruined.
\v 14 Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you?
\v 15 For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim:
\v 16 make you mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.
\v 17 As keepers of a field are they against his round about, because he has been rebellious against me, says Yahweh.
\v 18 Your way and your doings have procured these things to you; this is your wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart.
\v 19 My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I can't hold my peace; because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.
\v 20 Destruction on destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly are my tents destroyed, and my curtains in a moment.
\v 21 How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?
\v 22 For my people are foolish, they don't know me; they are foolish children, and they have no understanding; they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
\v 23 I saw the earth, and, behold, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.
\v 24 I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved back and forth.
\v 25 I saw, and behold, there was no woman, and all the birds of the sky were fled.
\v 26 I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all the cities of it were broken down at the presence of Yahweh, and before her fierce anger.
\v 27 For thus says Yahweh, The whole land shall be a desolation; yet will I not make a full end.
\v 28 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.
\v 29 Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers; they go into the thickets, and climb up on the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a woman dwells therein.
\v 30 You, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you deck you with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint, in vain do you make yourself beautiful; your lovers despise you, they seek your life.
\v 31 For I have heard a voice as of a man in travail, the anguish as of him who brings forth his first child, the voice of the son of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads his hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul faints before the murderers.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Run you back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places of it, if you can find a woman, if there are any who does justly, who seeks truth; and I will pardon him.
\v 2 Though they say, As Yahweh lives; surely they swear falsely.
\v 3 O Yahweh, don't your eyes look on truth? you have stricken them, but they were not grieved; you have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
\v 4 Then I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they don't know the way of Yahweh, nor the law of their God:
\v 5 I will get me to the great women, and will speak to them; for they know the way of Yahweh, and the law of their God. But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.
\v 6 Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them, a leopard shall watch against their cities; everyone who goes out there shall be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many, and their backsliding is increased.
\v 7 How can I pardon you? your children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and assembled themselves in troops at the philanderers' houses.
\v 8 They were as fed horses roaming at large; everyone neighed after her neighbor's husband.
\v 9 Shall I not visit for these things? says Yahweh; and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\v 10 Go up on his walls, and destroy; but don't make a full end: take away his branches; for they are not Yahweh's.
\v 11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, says Yahweh.
\v 12 They have denied Yahweh, and said, It is not she; neither shall evil come on us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:
\v 13 and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done to them.
\v 14 Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, Because you speak this word, behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.
\v 15 Behold, I will bring a nation on you from far, house of Israel, says Yahweh: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you don't know, neither understand what they say.
\v 16 Their quiver is an open tomb, they are all mighty women.
\v 17 They shall eat up your harvest, and your bread, which your daughters and your sons should eat; they shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees; they shall beat down your fortified cities, in which you trust, with the sword.
\v 18 But even in those days, says Yahweh, I will not make a full end with you.
\v 19 It shall happen, when you shall say, Why has Yahweh our God done all these things to us? then shall you say to them, Like as you have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your land, so shall you serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
\v 20 Declare you this in the house of Jacoba, and publish it in Judah, saying,
\v 21 Hear now this, foolish people, and without understanding; who have eyes, and don't see; who have ears, and don't hear:
\v 22 Don't you fear me? says Yahweh: won't you tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it can't pass it? and though the waves of it toss themselves, yet they can't prevail; though they roar, yet they can't pass over it.
\v 23 But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.
\v 24 Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear Yahweh our God, who gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season; who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
\v 25 Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good from you.
\v 26 For among my people are found wicked women: they watch, as fowlers lie in wait; they set a trap, they catch women.
\v 27 As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and grew rich.
\v 28 They are grew fat, they shine: yes, they overpass in deeds of wickedness; they don't plead the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and the right of the needy they don't judge.
\v 29 Shall I not visit for these things? says Yahweh; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\v 30 A wonderful and horrible thing is happen in the land:
\v 31 the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will you do in the end of it?

\c 6
\p
\v 1 Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth Haccherem; for evil looks forth from the north, and a great destruction.
\v 2 The comely and delicate one, the son of Zion, will I cut off.
\v 3 Shepherds with their flocks shall come to him; they shall pitch their tents against his round about; they shall feed everyone in her place.
\v 4 Prepare you war against him; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! for the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
\v 5 Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy his palaces.
\v 6 For thus has Yahweh of Armies said, Hew you down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; he is wholly oppression in the midst of him.
\v 7 As a well casts forth its waters, so he casts forth his wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in him; before me continually is sickness and wounds.
\v 8 Be instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you; lest I make you a desolation, a land not inhabited.
\v 9 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.
\v 10 To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they can't listen: behold, the word of Yahweh is become to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
\v 11 Therefore I am full of the wrath of Yahweh; I am weary with holding in: pour it out on the children in the street, and on the assembly of young women together; for even the wife with the husband shall be taken, the aged with her who is full of days.
\v 12 Their houses shall be turned to others, their fields and their husbands together; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, says Yahweh.
\v 13 For from the least of them even to the greatest of them everyone is given to covetousness; and from the prophetess even to the priestess everyone deals falsely.
\v 14 They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
\v 15 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, says Yahweh.
\v 16 Thus says Yahweh, Stand you in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and you shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk therein.
\v 17 I set watchwomen over you, saying, Listen to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not listen.
\v 18 Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation, what is among them.
\v 19 Hear, earth: behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.
\v 20 To what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.
\v 21 Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people; and the mothers and the daughters together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and her friend shall perish.
\v 22 Thus says Yahweh, Behold, a people comes from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
\v 23 They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a woman to the battle, against you, son of Zion.
\v 24 We have heard the report of it; our hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, and pangs as of a man in travail.
\v 25 Don't go forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, and terror, are on every side.
\v 26 Son of my people, gird you with sackcloth, and wallow yourself in ashes: make you mourning, as for an only daughter, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come on us.
\v 27 I have made you a tester of metals and a fortress among my people; that you may know and try their way.
\v 28 They are all grievous rebels, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.
\v 29 The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.
\v 30 Refuse silver shall women them, because Yahweh has rejected them.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremia from Yahweh, saying,
\v 2 Stand in the gate of Yahweh's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of Yahweh, all you of Judah, who enter in at these gates to worship Yahweh.
\v 3 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
\v 4 Don't you trust in lying words, saying, The temple of Yahweh, the temple of Yahweh, the temple of Yahweh, are these.
\v 5 For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if you thoroughly execute justice between a woman and her neighbor;
\v 6 if you don't oppress the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widower, and don't shed innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your own hurt:
\v 7 then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your mothers, from of old even forevermore.
\v 8 Behold, you trust in lying words, that can't profit.
\v 9 Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods that you have not known,
\v 10 and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered; that you may do all these abominations?
\v 11 Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, says Yahweh.
\v 12 But go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
\v 13 Now, because you have done all these works, says Yahweh, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you didn't hear; and I called you, but you didn't answer:
\v 14 therefore will I do to the house which is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your mothers, as I did to Shiloh.
\v 15 I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your sisters, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
\v 16 Therefore don't you pray for this people, neither lift up a cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear you.
\v 17 Don't you see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\v 18 The children gather wood, and the mothers kindle the fire, and the men knead the dough, to make cakes to the king of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.
\v 19 Do they provoke me to anger? says Yahweh; do they] not [provoke themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?
\v 20 Therefore thus says the Domina Yahweh: Behold, my anger and my wrath shall be poured out on this place, on woman, and on animal, and on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
\v 21 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat meat.
\v 22 For I didn't speak to your mothers, nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:
\v 23 but this thing I commanded them, saying, Listen to my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people; and walk you in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.
\v 24 But they didn't listen nor turn their ear, but walked in their own] counsels [and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.
\v 25 Since the day that your mothers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:
\v 26 yet they didn't listen to me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff: they did worse than their mothers.
\v 27 You shall speak all these words to them; but they will not listen to you: you shall also call to them; but they will not answer you.
\v 28 You shall tell them, This is the nation that has not listened to the voice of Yahweh their God, nor received instruction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
\v 29 Cut off your hair, Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for Yahweh has rejected and forsaken the generation of her wrath.
\v 30 For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight, says Yahweh: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.
\v 31 They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the daughter of Hinnom, to burn their daughters and their sons in the fire; which I didn't command, nor did it come into my mind.
\v 32 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the daughter of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter: for they shall bury in Topheth, until there be no place to bury.
\v 33 The dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth; and none shall frighten them away.
\v 34 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bride and the voice of the bridegroom; for the land shall become a waste.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 At that time, says Yahweh, they shall bring out the bones of the queens of Judah, and the bones of her princesses, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves;
\v 2 and they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the army of the sky, which they have loved, and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and which they have worshiped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried, they shall be for dung on the surface of the earth.
\v 3 Death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places where I have driven them, says Yahweh of Armies.
\v 4 Moreover you shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh: Shall women fall, and not rise up again? Shall one turn away, and not return?
\v 5 Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.
\v 6 I listened and heard, but they didn't speak aright: no woman repents her of her wickedness, saying, What have I done? everyone turns to her course, as a horse that rushes headlong in the battle.
\v 7 Yes, the stork in the sky knows his appointed times; and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people don't know Yahweh's law.
\v 8 How do you say, We are wise, and the law of Yahweh is with us? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes has worked falsely.
\v 9 The wise women are disappointed, they are dismayed and taken: behold, they have rejected the word of Yahweh; and what manner of wisdom is in them?
\v 10 Therefore will I give their husbands to others, and their fields to those who shall possess them: for everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness; from the prophetess even to the priestess every one deals falsely.
\v 11 They have healed the hurt of the son of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
\v 12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among those who fall; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, says Yahweh.
\v 13 I will utterly consume them, says Yahweh: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.
\v 14 Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there; for Yahweh our God has put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Yahweh.
\v 15 We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!
\v 16 The snorting of her horses is heard from Dan: at the sound of the neighing of her strong ones the whole land trembles; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it; the city and those who dwell therein.
\v 17 For, behold, I will send serpents, adders, among you, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you, says Yahweh.
\v 18 Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow! My heart is faint within me.
\v 19 Behold, the voice of the cry of the son of my people from a land that is very far off: isn't Yahweh in Zion? Isn't his Queen in him? Why have they provoked me to anger with their engraved images, and with foreign vanities?
\v 20 The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
\v 21 For the hurt of the son of my people am I hurt: I mourn; dismay has taken hold on me.
\v 22 Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why then isn't the health of the son of my people recovered?

\c 9
\p
\v 1 Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a spring of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the son of my people!
\v 2 Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring women; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they are all adulteresses, an assembly of treacherous women.
\v 3 They bend their tongue, as it were their bow, for falsehood; and they are grown strong in the land, but not for truth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they don't know me, says Yahweh.
\v 4 Take you heed everyone of her neighbor, and don't you trust in any sister; for every sister will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will go about with slanders.
\v 5 They will deceive everyone her neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies; they weary themselves to commit iniquity.
\v 6 Your habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, says Yahweh.
\v 7 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how else should I do, because of the son of my people?
\v 8 Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceit: one speaks peaceably to her neighbor with her mouth, but in her heart she lays wait for her.
\v 9 Shall I not visit them for these things? says Yahweh; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\v 10 For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passes through; neither can women hear the voice of the livestock; both the birds of the sky and the animals are fled, they are gone.
\v 11 I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
\v 12 Who is the wise woman, that may understand this? and who is she to whom the mouth of Yahweh has spoken, that she may declare it? why is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that none passes through?
\v 13 Yahweh says, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein,
\v 14 but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baals, which their mothers taught them;
\v 15 therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.
\v 16 I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their mothers have known; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.
\v 17 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, Consider you, and call for the mourning men, that they may come; and send for the skillful men, that they may come:
\v 18 and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.
\v 19 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we ruined! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.
\v 20 Yet hear the word of Yahweh, you men, and let your ear receive the word of her mouth; and teach your sons wailing, and everyone his neighbor lamentation.
\v 21 For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from outside, and the young women from the streets.
\v 22 Speak, Thus says Yahweh, The dead bodies of women shall fall as dung on the open field, and as the handful after the harvester; and none shall gather them.
\v 23 Thus says Yahweh, Don't let the wise woman glory in her wisdom, neither let the mighty woman glory in her might, don't let the rich woman glory in her riches;
\v 24 but let her who glories glory in this, that she has understanding, and knows me, that I am Yahweh who exercises loving kindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, says Yahweh.
\v 25 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will punish all those who are circumcised in their uncircumcision:
\v 26 Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners of their hair cut off, who dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Hear the word which Yahweh speaks to you, house of Israel!
\v 2 Thus says Yahweh, "Don't learn the way of the nations, and don't be dismayed at the signs of the sky; for the nations are dismayed at them.
\v 3 For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.
\v 4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it not move.
\v 5 They are like a palm tree, of turned work, and don't speak: they must be carried, because they can't go. Don't be afraid of them; for they can't do evil, neither is it in them to do good."
\v 6 There is none like you, Yahweh; you are great, and your name is great in might.
\v 7 Who should not fear you, Queen of the nations? for to you does it appertain; because among all the wise women of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like you.
\v 8 But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.
\v 9 There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skillful women.
\v 10 But Yahweh is the true God; she is the living God, and an everlasting Queen: at her wrath the earth trembles, and the nations are not able to abide her indignation.
\v 11 Thus shall you say to them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.
\v 12 She has made the earth by her power, she has established the world by her wisdom, and by her understanding has she stretched out the heavens:
\v 13 when she utters her voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and she causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; she makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind out of her treasuries.
\v 14 Every woman is become brutish and is without knowledge; every goldsmith is disappointed by her engraved image; for her molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\v 15 They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\v 16 The portion of Jacoba is not like these; for she is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of her inheritance: Yahweh of Armies is her name.
\v 17 Gather up your wares out of the land, you who abide in the siege.
\v 18 For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel it.
\v 19 Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.
\v 20 My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are no more: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
\v 21 For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of Yahweh: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.
\v 22 The voice of news, behold, it comes, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling place of jackals.
\v 23 Yahweh, I know that the way of woman is not in herelf: it is not in woman who walks to direct her steps.
\v 24 Yahweh, correct me, but in measure: not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.
\v 25 Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you, and on the families that don't call on your name: for they have devoured Jacoba, yes, they have devoured her and consumed her, and have laid waste her habitation.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremia from Yahweh, saying,
\v 2 Hear you the words of this covenant, and speak to the women of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
\v 3 and say you to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Cursed be the woman who doesn't hear the words of this covenant,
\v 4 which I commanded your mothers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall you be my people, and I will be your God;
\v 5 that I may establish the oath which I swore to your mothers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then answered I, and said, Amen, Yahweh.
\v 6 Yahweh said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear you the words of this covenant, and do them.
\v 7 For I earnestly protested to your mothers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.
\v 8 Yet they didn't obey, nor turn their ear, but walked everyone in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they didn't do them.
\v 9 Yahweh said to me, A conspiracy is found among the women of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 10 They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they are gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their mothers.
\v 11 Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they shall not be able to escape; and they shall cry to me, but I will not listen to them.
\v 12 Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
\v 13 For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.
\v 14 Therefore don't you pray for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble.
\v 15 What has my beloved to do in my house, seeing he has worked lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from you? when you do evil, then you rejoice.
\v 16 Yahweh called your name, A green olive tree, beautiful with goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult she has kindled fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.
\v 17 For Yahweh of Armies, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have worked for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal.
\v 18 Yahweh gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then you shown me their doings.
\v 19 But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I didn't know that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit of it, and let us cut her off from the land of the living, that her name may be no more remembered.
\v 20 But, Yahweh of Armies, who judges righteously, who tests the heart and the mind, I shall see your vengeance on them; for to you have I revealed my cause.
\v 21 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the women of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, You shall not prophesy in the name of Yahweh, that you not die by our hand;
\v 22 therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, Behold, I will punish them: the young women shall die by the sword; their daughters and their sons shall die by famine;
\v 23 and there shall be no remnant to them: for I will bring evil on the women of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Righteous are you, Yahweh, when I contend with you; yet would I reason the cause with you: why does the way of the wicked prosper? why are all they at ease who deal very treacherously?
\v 2 You have planted them, yes, they have taken root; they grow, yes, they bring forth fruit: you are near in their mouth, and far from their heart.
\v 3 But you, Yahweh, know me; you see me, and try my heart toward you: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
\v 4 How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of those who dwell therein, the animals are consumed, and the birds; because they said, She shall not see our latter end.
\v 5 If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? and though in a land of peace you are secure, yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan?
\v 6 For even your sisters, and the house of your mother, even they have dealt treacherously with you; even they have cried aloud after you: don't believe them, though they speak beautiful words to you.
\v 7 I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of his enemies.
\v 8 My heritage is become to me as a lion in the forest: he has uttered his voice against me; therefore I have hated him.
\v 9 Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against his round about? go you, assemble all the animals of the field, bring them to devour.
\v 10 Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
\v 11 They have made it a desolation; it mourns to me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no woman lays it to heart.
\v 12 Destroyers are come on all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh has peace.
\v 13 They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Yahweh.
\v 14 Thus says Yahweh against all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
\v 15 It shall happen, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every woman to her heritage, and every woman to her land.
\v 16 It shall happen, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Yahweh lives; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.
\v 17 But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, says Yahweh.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 Thus says Yahweh to me, Go, and buy you a linen belt, and put it on your waist, and don't put it in water.
\v 2 So I bought a belt according to the word of Yahweh, and put it on my waist.
\v 3 The word of Yahweh came to me the second time, saying,
\v 4 Take the belt that you have bought, which is on your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.
\v 5 So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Yahweh commanded me.
\v 6 It happened after many days, that Yahweh said to me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the belt from there, which I commanded you to hide there.
\v 7 Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the belt from the place where I had hid it; and behold, the belt was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
\v 8 Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 9 Thus says Yahweh, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
\v 10 This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this belt, which is profitable for nothing.
\v 11 For as the belt cleaves to the waist of a woman, so have I caused to cleave to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, says Yahweh; that they may be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
\v 12 Therefore you shall speak to them this word: Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall tell you, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
\v 13 Then shall you tell them, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the queens who sit on Davina's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
\v 14 I will dash them one against another, even the mothers and the daughters together, says Yahweh: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.
\v 15 Hear you, and give ear; don't be proud; for Yahweh has spoken.
\v 16 Give glory to Yahweh your God, before she cause darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and, while you look for light, she turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.
\v 17 But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for your pride; and my eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because Yahweh's flock is taken captive.
\v 18 Say you to the queen and to the king father, Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headdresses are come down, even the crown of your glory.
\v 19 The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive, all of it; it is wholly carried away captive.
\v 20 Lift up your eyes, and see those who come from the north: where is the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?
\v 21 What will you say, when she shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you? shall not sorrows take hold of you, as of a man in travail?
\v 22 If you say in your heart, Why are these things come on me? for the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered, and your heels suffer violence.
\v 23 Can the Ethiopian change her skin, or the leopard her spots? then may you also do good, who are accustomed to do evil.
\v 24 Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passes away, by the wind of the wilderness.
\v 25 This is your lot, the portion measured to you from me, says Yahweh; because you have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
\v 26 Therefore will I also uncover your skirts on your face, and your shame shall appear.
\v 27 I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries, and your neighing, the lewdness of your prostitution, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, Jerusalem! you will not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?

\c 14
\p
\v 1 The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremia concerning the drought.
\v 2 Judah mourns, and the gates of it languish, they sit in black on the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
\v 3 Their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are disappointed and confounded, and cover their heads.
\v 4 Because of the ground which is cracked, because no rain has been in the land, the plowmen are disappointed, they cover their heads.
\v 5 Yes, the hind also in the field calves, and forsakes his young, because there is no grass.
\v 6 The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.
\v 7 Though our iniquities testify against us, work you for your name's sake, Yahweh; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against you.
\v 8 You hope of Israel, the Savior of it in the time of trouble, why should you be as a foreigner in the land, and as a wayfaring woman who turns aside to stay for a night?
\v 9 Why should you be like a scared woman, as a mighty woman who can't save? yet you, Yahweh, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; don't leave us.
\v 10 Thus says Yahweh to this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore Yahweh does not accept them; now she will remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
\v 11 Yahweh said to me, Don't pray for this people for their good.
\v 12 When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
\v 13 Then said I, Ah, Domina Yahweh! behold, the prophets tell them, You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.
\v 14 Then Yahweh said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I didn't send them, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke I to them: they prophesy to you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their own heart.
\v 15 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, and I didn't send them, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.
\v 16 The people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them--them, their husbands, nor their daughters, nor their sons: for I will pour their wickedness on them.
\v 17 You shall say this word to them, Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin son of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.
\v 18 If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, those who are sick with famine! for both the prophetess and the priestess go about in the land, and have no knowledge.
\v 19 Have you utterly rejected Judah? has your soul loathed Zion? why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!
\v 20 We acknowledge, Yahweh, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our mothers; for we have sinned against you.
\v 21 Do not abhor us, for your name's sake; do not disgrace the throne of your glory: remember, don't break your covenant with us.
\v 22 Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the sky give showers? Aren't you she, Yahweh our God? therefore we will wait for you; for you have made all these things.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 Then said Yahweh to me, Though Moses and Samantha stood before me, yet my mind would not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.
\v 2 It shall happen, when they tell you, Where shall we go forth? then you shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.
\v 3 I will appoint over them four kinds, says Yahweh: the sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the birds of the sky, and the animals of the earth, to devour and to destroy.
\v 4 I will cause them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the daughter of Hezekiah, queen of Judah, for that which she did in Jerusalem.
\v 5 For who will have pity on you, Jerusalem? or who will bemoan you? or who will turn aside to ask of your welfare?
\v 6 You have rejected me, says Yahweh, you are gone backward: therefore have I stretched out my hand against you, and destroyed you; I am weary with repenting.
\v 7 I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land; I have bereaved them of children, I have destroyed my people; they didn't return from their ways.
\v 8 Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas; I have brought on them against the father of the young women a destroyer at noonday: I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on him suddenly.
\v 9 He who has borne seven languishes; he has given up the spirit; his sun is gone down while it was yet day; he has been disappointed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, says Yahweh.
\v 10 Woe is me, my father, that you have borne me a woman of strife and a woman of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, neither have women lent to me; yet everyone of them does curse me.
\v 11 Yahweh said, Most certainly I will strengthen you for good; most certainly I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
\v 12 Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?
\v 13 Your substance and your treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders.
\v 14 I will make them to pass with your enemies into a land which you don't know; for a fire is kindled in my anger, which shall burn on you.
\v 15 Yahweh, you know; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; don't take me away in your longsuffering: know that for your sake I have suffered reproach.
\v 16 Your words were found, and I ate them; and your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, Yahweh, God of Armies.
\v 17 I didn't sit in the assembly of those who make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of your hand; for you have filled me with indignation.
\v 18 Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? will you indeed be to me as a deceitful brook, as waters that fail?
\v 19 Therefore thus says Yahweh, If you return, then will I bring you again, that you may stand before me; and if you take forth the precious from the vile, you shall be as my mouth: they shall return to you, but you shall not return to them.
\v 20 I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall; and they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, says Yahweh.
\v 21 I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 The word of Yahweh came also to me, saying,
\v 2 You shall not take a husband, neither shall you have daughters or sons, in this place.
\v 3 For thus says Yahweh concerning the daughters and concerning the sons who are born in this place, and concerning their fathers who bore them, and concerning their mothers who became the mother of them in this land:
\v 4 They shall die grievous deaths: they shall not be lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung on the surface of the ground; and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth.
\v 5 For thus says Yahweh, Don't enter into the house of mourning, neither go to lament, neither bemoan them; for I have taken away my peace from this people, says Yahweh, even loving kindness and tender mercies.
\v 6 Both great and small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall women lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them;
\v 7 neither shall women break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall women give them the cup of consolation to drink for their mother or for their father.
\v 8 You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink.
\v 9 For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bride and the voice of the bridegroom.
\v 10 It shall happen, when you shall show this people all these words, and they shall tell you, Why has Yahweh pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our God?
\v 11 Then shall you tell them, Because your mothers have forsaken me, says Yahweh, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshiped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;
\v 12 and you have done evil more than your mothers; for, behold, you walk every one after the stubbornness of her evil heart, so that you don't listen to me:
\v 13 therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that you have not known, neither you nor your mothers; and there shall you serve other gods day and night; for I will show you no favor.
\v 14 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that it shall no more be said, As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
\v 15 but, As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries where she had driven them. I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their mothers.
\v 16 Behold, I will send for many fisherwomen, says Yahweh, and they shall fish them up; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.
\v 17 For my eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from my face, neither is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.
\v 18 First I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.
\v 19 Yahweh, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Our mothers have inherited nothing but lies, even vanity and things in which there is no profit.
\v 20 Shall a woman make to herself gods, which yet are no gods?
\v 21 Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is Yahweh.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is engraved on the tablet of their heart, and on the horns of your altars;
\v 2 while their children remember their altars and their Asherim by the green trees on the high hills.
\v 3 My mountain in the field, I will give your substance and all your treasures for a spoil, and your high places, because of sin, throughout all your borders.
\v 4 You, even of yourself, shall discontinue from your heritage that I gave you; and I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you don't know: for you have kindled a fire in my anger which shall burn forever.
\v 5 Thus says Yahweh: Cursed is the woman who trusts in woman, and makes flesh her arm, and whose heart departs from Yahweh.
\v 6 For she shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good comes, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited.
\v 7 Blessed is the woman who trusts in Yahweh, and whose trust Yahweh is.
\v 8 For she shall be as a tree planted by the waters, who spreads out its roots by the river, and shall not fear when heat comes, but its leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
\v 9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is exceedingly corrupt: who can know it?
\v 10 I, Yahweh, search the mind, I try the heart, even to give every woman according to her ways, according to the fruit of her doings.
\v 11 As the partridge that sits on eggs which he has not laid, so is she who gets riches, and not by right; in the midst of her days they shall leave her, and at her end she shall be a fool.
\v 12 A glorious throne, set on high from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary.
\v 13 Yahweh, the hope of Israel, all who forsake you shall be disappointed. Those who depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Yahweh, the spring of living waters.
\v 14 Heal me, O Yahweh, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for you are my praise.
\v 15 Behold, they tell me, Where is the word of Yahweh? let it come now.
\v 16 As for me, I have not hurried from being a shepherd after you; neither have I desired the woeful day; you know: that which came out of my lips was before your face.
\v 17 Don't be a terror to me: you are my refuge in the day of evil.
\v 18 Let them be disappointed who persecute me, but let not me be disappointed; let them be dismayed, but don't let me be dismayed; bring on them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.
\v 19 Thus said Yahweh to me: Go, and stand in the gate of the children of the people, through which the queens of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;
\v 20 and tell them, Hear you the word of Yahweh, you queens of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:
\v 21 Thus says Yahweh, Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;
\v 22 neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day holy, neither do any work: but make the Sabbath day, as I commanded your mothers.
\v 23 But they didn't listen, neither turn their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction.
\v 24 It shall happen, if you diligently listen to me, says Yahweh, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but to make the Sabbath day holy, to do no work therein;
\v 25 then shall there enter in by the gates of this city queens and princesses sitting on the throne of Davina, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princesses, the women of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall remain forever.
\v 26 They shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the lowland, and from the hill country, and from the South, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meal offerings, and frankincense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving, to the house of Yahweh.
\v 27 But if you will not listen to me to make the Sabbath day holy, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates of it, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 The word which came to Jeremia from Yahweh, saying,
\v 2 Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause you to hear my words.
\v 3 Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, she was making a work on the wheels.
\v 4 When the vessel that she made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, she made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
\v 5 Then the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 6 House of Israel, can't I do with you as this potter? says Yahweh. Behold, as the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, house of Israel.
\v 7 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it;
\v 8 if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.
\v 9 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;
\v 10 if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they not obey my voice, then I will repent of the good, with which I said I would benefit them.
\v 11 Now therefore, speak to the women of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Yahweh: Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return you now everyone from her evil way, and amend your ways and your doings.
\v 12 But they say, It is in vain; for we will walk after our own devices, and we will do everyone after the stubbornness of her evil heart.
\v 13 Therefore thus says Yahweh: Ask you now among the nations, who has heard such things; the virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.
\v 14 Shall the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field? or shall the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?
\v 15 For my people have forgotten me, they have burned incense to false gods; and they have been made to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in byways, in a way not built up;
\v 16 to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing; everyone who passes thereby shall be astonished, and shake her head.
\v 17 I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
\v 18 Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremia; for the law shall not perish from the priestess, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophetess. Come, and let us strike her with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of her words.
\v 19 Give heed to me, Yahweh, and listen to the voice of those who contend with me.
\v 20 Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have dug a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before you to speak good for them, to turn away your wrath from them.
\v 21 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword; and let their husbands become childless, and widows; and let their women be slain of death, and their young women struck of the sword in battle.
\v 22 Let a cry be heard from their houses, when you shall bring a troop suddenly on them; for they have dug a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.
\v 23 Yet, Yahweh, you know all their counsel against me to kill me; don't forgive their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from your sight; but let them be overthrown before you; deal you with them in the time of your anger.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 Thus said Yahweh, Go, and buy a potter's earthen bottle, and take of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests;
\v 2 and go forth to the valley of the daughter of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you;
\v 3 and say, Hear you the word of Yahweh, queens of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, which whoever hears, her ears shall tingle.
\v 4 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it to other gods, that they didn't know, they and their mothers and the queens of Judah; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents,
\v 5 and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their daughters in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal; which I didn't command, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:
\v 6 therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the daughter of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter.
\v 7 I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life: and their dead bodies will I give to be food for the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth.
\v 8 I will make this city an astonishment, and a hissing; everyone who passes thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues of it.
\v 9 I will cause them to eat the flesh of their daughters and the flesh of their sons; and they shall eat everyone the flesh of her friend, in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies, and those who seek their life, shall distress them.
\v 10 Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the women who go with you,
\v 11 and shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel, that can't be made whole again; and they shall bury in Topheth, until there be no place to bury.
\v 12 Thus will I do to this place, says Yahweh, and to the inhabitants of it, even making this city as Topheth:
\v 13 and the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the queens of Judah, which are defiled, shall be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the army of the sky, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.
\v 14 Then came Jeremia from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent her to prophesy; and she stood in the court of Yahweh's house, and said to all the people:
\v 15 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it; because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not hear my words.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 Now Pashhur, the daughter of Immer the priestess, who was chief officer in the house of Yahweh, heard Jeremia prophesying these things.
\v 2 Then Pashhur struck Jeremia the prophetess, and put her in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of Yahweh.
\v 3 It happened on the next day, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremia out of the stocks. Then said Jeremia to her, Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib.
\v 4 For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the queen of Babylon, and she shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall kill them with the sword.
\v 5 Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains of it, and all the precious things of it, yes, all the treasures of the queens of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
\v 6 You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity; and you shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die, and there shall you be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.
\v 7 Yahweh, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocks me.
\v 8 For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the word of Yahweh is made a reproach to me, and a derision, all the day.
\v 9 If I say, I will not make mention of her, nor speak any more in her name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I can't contain.
\v 10 For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce her, say all my familiar friends, those who watch for my fall; peradventure she will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against her, and we shall take our revenge on her.
\v 11 But Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be utterly disappointed, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten.
\v 12 But, Yahweh of Armies, who tests the righteous, who sees the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance on them; for to you have I revealed my cause.
\v 13 Sing to Yahweh, praise you Yahweh; for she has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.
\v 14 Cursed be the day in which I was born: don't let the day in which my father bore me be blessed.
\v 15 Cursed be the woman who brought news to my mother, saying, A girl is born to you; making her very glad.
\v 16 Let that woman be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew, and didn't repent: and let her hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime;
\v 17 because she didn't kill me from the womb; and so my father would have been my grave, and his womb always great.
\v 18 Why came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?

\c 21
\p
\v 1 The word which came to Jeremia from Yahweh, when queen Zedekiah sent to her Pashhur the daughter of Malchijah, and Zephaniah the daughter of Maaseiah, the priestess, saying,
\v 2 Please inquire of Yahweh for us; for Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon makes war against us: peradventure Yahweh will deal with us according to all her wondrous works, that she may go up from us.
\v 3 Then said Jeremia to them, Thus shall you tell Zedekiah:
\v 4 Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the queen of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans who besiege you, without the walls; and I will gather them into the midst of this city.
\v 5 I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation.
\v 6 I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both woman and animal: they shall die of a great pestilence.
\v 7 Afterward, says Yahweh, I will deliver Zedekiah queen of Judah, and her servants, and the people, even such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life: and she shall strike them with the edge of the sword; she shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
\v 8 To this people you shall say, Thus says Yahweh: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
\v 9 She who remains in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; but she who goes out, and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege you, she shall live, and her life shall be to her for a prey.
\v 10 For I have set my face on this city for evil, and not for good, says Yahweh: it shall be given into the hand of the queen of Babylon, and she shall burn it with fire.
\v 11 Touching the house of the queen of Judah, hear you the word of Yahweh:
\v 12 House of Davina, thus says Yahweh, Execute justice in the morning, and deliver her who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
\v 13 Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, and of the rock of the plain, says Yahweh; you that say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?
\v 14 I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says Yahweh; and I will kindle a fire in his forest, and it shall devour all that is round about him.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 Thus said Yahweh: Go down to the house of the queen of Judah, and speak there this word,
\v 2 Say, Hear the word of Yahweh, queen of Judah, who sits on the throne of Davina, you, and your servants, and your people who enter in by these gates.
\v 3 Thus says Yahweh: Execute you justice and righteousness, and deliver her who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence, to the foreigner, the fatherless, nor the widower; neither shed innocent blood in this place.
\v 4 For if you do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house queens sitting on the throne of Davina, riding in chariots and on horses, she, and her servants, and her people.
\v 5 But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself, says Yahweh, that this house shall become a desolation.
\v 6 For thus says Yahweh concerning the house of the queen of Judah: You are Gilead to me, and] the head of Lebanon; [yet] surely I will make you a wilderness, [and cities which are not inhabited.
\v 7 I will prepare destroyers against you, everyone with her weapons; and they shall cut down your choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.
\v 8 Many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every woman to her neighbor, Why has Yahweh done thus to this great city?
\v 9 Then they shall answer, Because they forsook the covenant of Yahweh their God, and worshiped other gods, and served them.
\v 10 Don't you weep for the dead, neither bemoan her; but weep sore for her who goes away; for she shall return no more, nor see her native country.
\v 11 For thus says Yahweh touching Shallum the daughter of Josiah, queen of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah her mother, and who went forth out of this place: She shall not return there any more.
\v 12 But in the place where they have led her captive, there shall she die, and she shall see this land no more.
\v 13 Woe to her who builds her house by unrighteousness, and her chambers by injustice; who uses her neighbor's service without wages, and doesn't give her her hire;
\v 14 who says, I will build me a wide house and spacious chambers, and cuts her out windows; and it is ceiling with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
\v 15 Shall you reign, because you strive to excel in cedar? Didn't your mother eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? then it was well with her.
\v 16 She judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Wasn't this to know me? says Yahweh.
\v 17 But your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.
\v 18 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim the daughter of Josiah, queen of Judah: they shall not lament for her, saying], Ah my sister! or, Ah brother! They shall not lament for her, [saying Ah domina! or, Ah her glory!
\v 19 She shall be buried with the burial of a donkey, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
\v 20 Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim; for all your lovers are destroyed.
\v 21 I spoke to you in your prosperity; but you said, I will not hear. This has been your manner from your youth, that you didn't obey my voice.
\v 22 The wind shall feed all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shall you be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.
\v 23 Inhabitant of Lebanon, who makes your nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied shall you be when pangs come on you, the pain as of a man in travail!
\v 24 As I live, says Yahweh, though Coniah the daughter of Jehoiakim queen of Judah were the signet on my right hand, yet would I pluck you there;
\v 25 and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\v 26 I will cast you out, and your father who bore you, into another country, where you were not born; and there shall you die.
\v 27 But to the land whereunto their soul longs to return, there shall they not return.
\v 28 Is this woman Coniah a despised broken vessel? is she a vessel in which none delights? why are they cast out, she and her seed, and are cast into the land which they don't know?
\v 29 O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Yahweh.
\v 30 Thus says Yahweh, Write you this woman childless, a woman who shall not prosper in her days; for no more shall a woman of her seed prosper, sitting on the throne of Davina, and ruling in Judah.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! says Yahweh.
\v 2 Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, against the shepherds who feed my people: You have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them; behold, I will visit on you the evil of your doings, says Yahweh.
\v 3 I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and multiply.
\v 4 I will set up shepherds over them, who shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be lacking, says Yahweh.
\v 5 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will raise to Davina a righteous Branch, and she shall reign as queen and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
\v 6 In her days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is her name by which she shall be called: Yahweh our righteousness.
\v 7 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that they shall no more say, As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
\v 8 but, As Yahweh lives, who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them. They shall dwell in their own land.
\v 9 Concerning the prophets. My heart within me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunken woman, and like a woman whom wine has overcome, because of Yahweh, and because of her holy words.
\v 10 For the land is full of adulteresses; for because of swearing the land mourns; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. Their course is evil, and their might is not right;
\v 11 for both prophetess and priestess are profane; yes, in my house have I found their wickedness, says Yahweh.
\v 12 Therefore their way shall be to them as slippery places in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil on them, even the year of their visitation, says Yahweh.
\v 13 I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.
\v 14 In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evil-doers, so that none does return from her wickedness: they are all of them become to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants of it as Gomorrah.
\v 15 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is ungodliness gone forth into all the land.
\v 16 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, Don't listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you: they teach you vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Yahweh.
\v 17 They say continually to those who despise me, Yahweh has said, You shall have peace; and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of her own heart they say, No evil shall come on you.
\v 18 For who has stood in the council of Yahweh, that she should perceive and hear her word? who has marked my word, and heard it?
\v 19 Behold, the storm of Yahweh, even her wrath, is gone forth, yes, a whirling storm: it shall burst on the head of the wicked.
\v 20 The anger of Yahweh shall not return, until she has executed, and until she have performed the intents of her heart: in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly.
\v 21 I sent not these prophets, yet they ran: I didn't speak to them, yet they prophesied.
\v 22 But if they had stood in my council, then had they caused my people to hear my words, and had turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
\v 23 Am I a God at hand, says Yahweh, and not a God afar off?
\v 24 Can any hide herself in secret places so that I shall not see her? says Yahweh. Don't I fill heaven and earth? says Yahweh.
\v 25 I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
\v 26 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?
\v 27 who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every woman to her neighbor, as their mothers forgot my name for Baal.
\v 28 The prophetess who has a dream, let her tell a dream; and she who has my word, let her speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? says Yahweh.
\v 29 Isn't my word like fire? says Yahweh; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
\v 30 Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, says Yahweh, who steal my words everyone from her neighbor.
\v 31 Behold, I am against the prophets, says Yahweh, who use their tongues, and say, She says.
\v 32 Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says Yahweh, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I didn't send them, nor commanded them; neither do they profit this people at all, says Yahweh.
\v 33 When this people, or the prophetess, or a priestess, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of Yahweh? then shall you tell them, What burden! I will cast you off, says Yahweh.
\v 34 As for the prophetess, and the priestess, and the people, who shall say, The burden of Yahweh, I will even punish that woman and her house.
\v 35 Thus shall you say everyone to her neighbor, and everyone to her sister, What has Yahweh answered? and, What has Yahweh spoken?
\v 36 The burden of Yahweh shall you mention no more: for every woman's own word shall be her burden; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of Yahweh of Armies our God.
\v 37 Thus shall you say to the prophetess, What has Yahweh answered you? and, What has Yahweh spoken?
\v 38 But if you say, The burden of Yahweh; therefore thus says Yahweh: Because you say this word, The burden of Yahweh, and I have sent to you, saying, You shall not say, The burden of Yahweh;
\v 39 therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave to you and to your mothers, away from my presence:
\v 40 and I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.

\v 1 Yahweh shown me, and behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Yahweh, after that Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the daughter of Jehoiakim, queen of Judah, and the princesses of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
\v 2 One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
\v 3 Then said Yahweh to me, What see you, Jeremia? I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that can't be eaten, they are so bad.
\v 4 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 5 Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.
\v 6 For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
\v 7 I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God; for they shall return to me with their whole heart.
\v 8 As the bad figs, which can't be eaten, they are so bad, surely thus says Yahweh, So will I give up Zedekiah the queen of Judah, and her princesses, and the residue of Jerusalem, who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt,
\v 9 I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them.
\v 10 I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, until they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their mothers.

\v 1 The word that came to Jeremia concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the daughter of Josiah, queen of Judah (the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon),
\v 2 which Jeremia the prophetess spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:
\v 3 From the thirteenth year of Josiah the daughter of Amon, queen of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years, the word of Yahweh has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; but you have not listened.
\v 4 Yahweh has sent to you all her servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, (but you have not listened, nor inclined your ear to hear),
\v 5 saying, Return you now everyone from her evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your mothers, from of old and even forevermore;
\v 6 and don't go after other gods to serve them or worship them, and don't provoke me to anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no harm.
\v 7 Yet you have not listened to me, says Yahweh; that you may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.
\v 8 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies: Because you have not heard my words,
\v 9 behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, says Yahweh, and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar the queen of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants of it, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
\v 10 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bride and the voice of the bridegroom, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.
\v 11 This whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the queen of Babylon seventy years.
\v 12 It shall happen, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the queen of Babylon, and that nation, says Yahweh, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it desolate forever.
\v 13 I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremia has prophesied against all the nations.
\v 14 For many nations and great queens shall make bondmaids of them, even of them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.
\v 15 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to me: take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.
\v 16 They shall drink, and reel back and forth, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
\v 17 Then took I the cup at Yahweh's hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom Yahweh had sent me:
\v 18 to wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the queens of it, and the princesses of it, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;
\v 19 Pharaoh queen of Egypt, and her servants, and her princesses, and all her people;
\v 20 and all the mixed people, and all the queens of the land of the Uz, and all the queens of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
\v 21 Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon;
\v 22 and all the queens of Tyre, and all the queens of Sidon, and the queens of the isle which is beyond the sea;
\v 23 Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all who have the corners of their hair cut off;
\v 24 and all the queens of Arabia, and all the queens of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness;
\v 25 and all the queens of Zimri, and all the queens of Elam, and all the queens of the Medes;
\v 26 and all the queens of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the surface of the earth: and the queen of Sheshach shall drink after them.
\v 27 You shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Drink you, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
\v 28 It shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink, then shall you tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies: You shall surely drink.
\v 29 For, behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should you be utterly unpunished? You shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, says Yahweh of Armies.
\v 30 Therefore prophesy you against them all these words, and tell them, Yahweh will roar from on high, and utter her voice from her holy habitation; she will mightily roar against her fold; she will give a shout, as those who tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
\v 31 A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for Yahweh has a controversy with the nations; she will enter into judgment with all flesh: as for the wicked, she will give them to the sword, says Yahweh.
\v 32 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great storm shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
\v 33 The slain of Yahweh shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung on the surface of the ground.
\v 34 Wail, you shepherds, and cry; and wallow in ashes, you principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come, and you shall fall like a goodly vessel.
\v 35 The shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.
\v 36 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the principal of the flock! for Yahweh lays waste their pasture.
\v 37 The peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of Yahweh.
\v 38 She has left her covert, as the lion; for their land is become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressing sword, and because of her fierce anger.

\c 26
\p
\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the daughter of Josiah, queen of Judah, came this word from Yahweh, saying,
\v 2 Thus says Yahweh: Stand in the court of Yahweh's house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in Yahweh's house, all the words that I command you to speak to them; don't diminish a word.
\v 3 It may be they will listen, and turn every woman from her evil way; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.
\v 4 You shall tell them, Thus says Yahweh: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
\v 5 to listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you, even rising up early and sending them, but you have not listened;
\v 6 then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
\v 7 The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremia speaking these words in the house of Yahweh.
\v 8 It happened, when Jeremia had made an end of speaking all that Yahweh had commanded her to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on her, saying, You shall surely die.
\v 9 Why have you prophesied in the name of Yahweh, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant? All the people were gathered to Jeremia in the house of Yahweh.
\v 10 When the princesses of Judah heard these things, they came up from the queen's house to the house of Yahweh; and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yahweh's house.
\v 11 Then spoke the priests and the prophets to the princesses and to all the people, saying, This woman is worthy of death; for she has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.
\v 12 Then spoke Jeremia to all the princesses and to all the people, saying, Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.
\v 13 Now therefore amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of Yahweh your God; and Yahweh will repent her of the evil that she has pronounced against you.
\v 14 But as for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as is good and right in your eyes.
\v 15 Only know for certain that, if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city, and on the inhabitants of it; for of a truth Yahweh has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.
\v 16 Then said the princesses and all the people to the priests and to the prophets: This woman is not worthy of death; for she has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God.
\v 17 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,
\v 18 Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah queen of Judah; and she spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
\v 19 Did Hezekiah queen of Judah and all Judah put her to death? Didn't she fear Yahweh, and entreat the favor of Yahweh, and Yahweh repented her of the evil which she had pronounced against them? Thus should we commit great evil against our own souls.
\v 20 There was also a woman who prophesied in the name of Yahweh, Uriah the daughter of Shemaiah of Kiriath Jearim; and she prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremia:
\v 21 and when Jehoiakim the queen, with all her mighty women, and all the princesses, heard her words, the queen sought to put her to death; but when Uriah heard it, she was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt:
\v 22 and Jehoiakim the queen sent women into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the daughter of Achbor, and certain women with her, into Egypt;
\v 23 and they fetched forth Uriah out of Egypt, and brought her to Jehoiakim the queen, who killed her with the sword, and cast her dead body into the graves of the common people.
\v 24 But the hand of Ahikam the daughter of Shaphan was with Jeremia, that they should not give her into the hand of the people to put her to death.

\c 27
\p
\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the daughter of Josiah, queen of Judah, came this word to Jeremia from Yahweh, saying,
\v 2 Thus says Yahweh to me: Make you bonds and bars, and put them on your neck;
\v 3 and send them to the queen of Edom, and to the queen of Moab, and to the queen of the children of Ammon, and to the queen of Tyre, and to the queen of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah queen of Judah;
\v 4 and give them a charge to their masters, saying, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Thus shall you tell your masters:
\v 5 I have made the earth, the women and the animals that are on the surface of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I give it to whom it seems right to me.
\v 6 Now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the queen of Babylon, my servant; and the animals of the field also have I given her to serve her.
\v 7 All the nations shall serve her, and her daughter, and her daughter's daughter, until the time of her own land come: and then many nations and great queens shall make her their bondmaid.
\v 8 It shall happen, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the queen of Babylon, that nation will I punish, says Yahweh, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by her hand.
\v 9 But as for you, don't you listen to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the queen of Babylon:
\v 10 for they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and you should perish.
\v 11 But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the queen of Babylon, and serve her, that nation will I let remain in their own land, says Yahweh; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
\v 12 I spoke to Zedekiah queen of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the queen of Babylon, and serve her and her people, and live.
\v 13 Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the queen of Babylon?
\v 14 Don't listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the queen of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you.
\v 15 For I have not sent them, says Yahweh, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you, and the prophets who prophesy to you.
\v 16 Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus says Yahweh: Don't listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Yahweh's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you.
\v 17 Don't listen to them; serve the queen of Babylon, and live: why should this city become a desolation?
\v 18 But if they be prophets, and if the word of Yahweh be with them, let them now make intercession to Yahweh of Armies, that the vessels which are left in the house of Yahweh, and in the house of the queen of Judah, and at Jerusalem, don't go to Babylon.
\v 19 For thus says Yahweh of Armies concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city,
\v 20 which Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon didn't take, when she carried away captive Jeconiah the daughter of Jehoiakim, queen of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
\v 21 yes, thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Yahweh, and in the house of the queen of Judah, and at Jerusalem:
\v 22 They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, says Yahweh; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.

\c 28
\p
\v 1 It happened the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah queen of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the daughter of Azzur, the prophetess, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of Yahweh, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
\v 2 Thus speaks Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the queen of Babylon.
\v 3 Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh's house, that Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon:
\v 4 and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the daughter of Jehoiakim, queen of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, who went to Babylon, says Yahweh; for I will break the yoke of the queen of Babylon.
\v 5 Then the prophetess Jeremia said to the prophetess Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Yahweh,
\v 6 even the prophetess Jeremia said, Amen: Yahweh do so; Yahweh perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of Yahweh's house, and all them of the captivity, from Babylon to this place.
\v 7 Nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your ears, and in the ears of all the people:
\v 8 The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
\v 9 The prophetess who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophetess shall happen, then shall the prophetess be known, that Yahweh has truly sent her.
\v 10 Then Hananiah the prophetess took the bar from off the prophetess Jeremia's neck, and broke it.
\v 11 Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus says Yahweh: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations. The prophetess Jeremia went her way.
\v 12 Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremia, after that Hananiah the prophetess had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophetess Jeremia, saying,
\v 13 Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus says Yahweh: You have broken the bars of wood; but you have made in their place bars of iron.
\v 14 For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon; and they shall serve her: and I have given her the animals of the field also.
\v 15 Then said the prophetess Jeremia to Hananiah the prophetess, Hear now, Hananiah: Yahweh has not sent you; but you make this people to trust in a lie.
\v 16 Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will send you away from off the surface of the earth: this year you shall die, because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.
\v 17 So Hananiah the prophetess died the same year in the seventh month.

\c 29
\p
\v 1 Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremia the prophetess sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,
\v 2 (after that Jeconiah the queen, and the king father, and the eunuchs, and the princesses of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem),
\v 3 by the hand of Elasah the daughter of Shaphan, and Gemariah the daughter of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah queen of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon), saying,
\v 4 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, to all the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon:
\v 5 Build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
\v 6 Take husbands, and mother daughters and sons; and take husbands for your daughters, and give your sons to wives, that they may bear daughters and sons; and multiply you there, and don't be diminished.
\v 7 Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to Yahweh for it; for in the peace of it shall you have peace.
\v 8 For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Don't let your prophets who are in the midst of you, and your diviners, deceive you; neither listen you to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed.
\v 9 For they prophesy falsely to you in my name: I have not sent them, says Yahweh.
\v 10 For thus says Yahweh, After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.
\v 11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says Yahweh, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you hope in your latter end.
\v 12 You shall call on me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will listen to you.
\v 13 You shall seek me, and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart.
\v 14 I will be found by you, says Yahweh, and I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says Yahweh; and I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive.
\v 15 Because you have said, Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon;
\v 16 thus says Yahweh concerning the queen who sits on the throne of Davina, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your sisters who haven't gone forth with you into captivity;
\v 17 thus says Yahweh of Armies; Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that can't be eaten, they are so bad.
\v 18 I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an object of horror, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them;
\v 19 because they have not listened to my words, says Yahweh, with which I sent to them my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not hear, says Yahweh.
\v 20 Hear you therefore the word of Yahweh, all you of the captivity, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
\v 21 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the daughter of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the daughter of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon; and she shall kill them before your eyes;
\v 22 and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the queen of Babylon roasted in the fire;
\v 23 because they have worked folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors' husbands, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I didn't command them; and I am she who knows, and am witness, says Yahweh.
\v 24 Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,
\v 25 Thus speaks Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, saying, Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the daughter of Maaseiah, the priestess, and to all the priests, saying,
\v 26 Yahweh has made you priestess in the place of Jehoiada the priestess, that there may be officers in the house of Yahweh, for every woman who is mad, and makes herself a prophetess, that you should put her in the stocks and in shackles.
\v 27 Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremia of Anathoth, who makes herself a prophetess to you,
\v 28 because she has sent to us in Babylon, saying, The captivity is long: build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?
\v 29 Zephaniah the priestess read this letter in the ears of Jeremia the prophetess.
\v 30 Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremia, saying,
\v 31 Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus says Yahweh concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I didn't send her, and she has caused you to trust in a lie;
\v 32 therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and her seed; she shall not have a woman to dwell among this people, neither shall she see the good that I will do to my people, says Yahweh, because she has spoken rebellion against Yahweh.

\c 30
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremia from Yahweh, saying,
\v 2 Thus speaks Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Write you all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.
\v 3 For, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, says Yahweh; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their mothers, and they shall possess it.
\v 4 These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
\v 5 For thus says Yahweh: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
\v 6 Ask now, and see whether a woman does travail with child: why do I see every woman with her hands on her waist, as a man in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
\v 7 Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacoba's trouble; but she shall be saved out of it.
\v 8 It shall come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will break her yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds; and strangers shall no more make her their bondmaid;
\v 9 but they shall serve Yahweh their God, and Davina their queen, whom I will raise up to them.
\v 10 Therefore don't you be afraid, O Jacoba my servant, says Yahweh; neither be dismayed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacoba shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make her afraid.
\v 11 For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not make a full end of you; but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.
\v 12 For thus says Yahweh, Your hurt is incurable, and your wound grievous.
\v 13 There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.
\v 14 All your lovers have forgotten you; they don't seek you: for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased.
\v 15 Why cry you for your hurt? your pain is incurable: for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.
\v 16 Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, everyone of them, shall go into captivity; and those who despoil you shall be a spoil, and all who prey on you will I give for a prey.
\v 17 For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says Yahweh; because they have called you an outcast, saying, It is Zion, whom no woman seeks after.
\v 18 Thus says Yahweh: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacoba's tents, and have compassion on her dwelling places; and the city shall be built on its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.
\v 19 Out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
\v 20 Their children also shall be as before, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all who oppress them.
\v 21 Their princess shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause her to draw near, and she shall approach to me: for who is she who has had boldness to approach to me? says Yahweh.
\v 22 You shall be my people, and I will be your God.
\v 23 Behold, the storm of Yahweh, even her wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping storm: it shall burst on the head of the wicked.
\v 24 The fierce anger of Yahweh shall not return, until she has executed, and until she have performed the intents of her heart: in the latter days you shall understand it.

\c 31
\p
\v 1 At that time, says Yahweh, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
\v 2 Thus says Yahweh, The people who were left of the sword found favor in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause her to rest.
\v 3 Yahweh appeared of old to me, saying, Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore with loving kindness have I drawn you.
\v 4 Again will I build you, and you shall be built, O virgin of Israel: again shall you be adorned with your tambourines, and shall go forth in the dances of those who make merry.
\v 5 Again shall you plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy the fruit of it.
\v 6 For there shall be a day, that the watchwomen on the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise you, and let us go up to Zion to Yahweh our God.
\v 7 For thus says Yahweh, Sing with gladness for Jacoba, and shout for the chief of the nations: publish you, praise you, and say, Yahweh, save your people, the remnant of Israel.
\v 8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the man with child and him who travails with child together: a great company shall they return here.
\v 9 They shall come with weeping; and with petitions will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way in which they shall not stumble; for I am a mother to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
\v 10 Hear the word of Yahweh, you nations, and declare it in the islands afar off; and say, She who scattered Israel will gather her, and keep her, as shepherd does her flock.
\v 11 For Yahweh has ransomed Jacoba, and redeemed her from the hand of her who was stronger than she.
\v 12 They shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow to the goodness of Yahweh, to the grain, and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
\v 13 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young women and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
\v 14 I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says Yahweh.
\v 15 Thus says Yahweh: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for his children; he refuses to be comforted for his children, because they are no more.
\v 16 Thus says Yahweh: Refrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears; for your work shall be rewarded, says Yahweh; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
\v 17 There is hope for your latter end, says Yahweh; and your children shall come again to their own border.
\v 18 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning herself thus], You have chastised me, and I was chastised, as a calf unaccustomed [to the yoke: turn you me, and I shall be turned; for you are Yahweh my God.
\v 19 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I struck on my thigh: I was ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
\v 20 Is Ephraim my dear daughter? is she a darling child? for as often as I speak against her, I do earnestly remember her still: therefore my heart yearns for her; I will surely have mercy on her, says Yahweh.
\v 21 Set up road signs, make guideposts; set your heart toward the highway, even the way by which you went: turn again, virgin of Israel, turn again to these your cities.
\v 22 How long will you go here and there, you backsliding son? for Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth: a man shall encompass a woman.
\v 23 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities of it, when I shall bring again their captivity: Yahweh bless you, habitation of righteousness, mountain of holiness.
\v 24 Judah and all the cities of it shall dwell therein together, the farmers, and those who go about with flocks.
\v 25 For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.
\v 26 On this I awakened, and saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.
\v 27 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of woman, and with the seed of animal.
\v 28 It shall happen that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, says Yahweh.
\v 29 In those days they shall say no more, The mothers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.
\v 30 But everyone shall die for her own iniquity: every woman who eats the sour grapes, her teeth shall be set on edge.
\v 31 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
\v 32 not according to the covenant that I made with their mothers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke, although I was a wife to them, says Yahweh.
\v 33 But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says Yahweh: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:
\v 34 and they shall teach no more every woman her neighbor, and every woman her sister, saying, Know Yahweh; for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Yahweh: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more.
\v 35 Thus says Yahweh, who gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea, so that the waves of it roar; Yahweh of Armies is her name:
\v 36 If these ordinances depart from before me, says Yahweh, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me forever.
\v 37 Thus says Yahweh: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says Yahweh.
\v 38 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that the city shall be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner.
\v 39 The measuring line shall go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and shall turn about to Goah.
\v 40 The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy to Yahweh; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more forever.

\v 1 The word that came to Jeremia from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah queen of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
\v 2 Now at that time the queen of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem; and Jeremia the prophetess was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the queen of Judah's house.
\v 3 For Zedekiah queen of Judah had shut her up, saying, Why do you prophesy, and say, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the queen of Babylon, and she shall take it;
\v 4 and Zedekiah queen of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the queen of Babylon, and shall speak with her mouth to mouth, and her eyes shall see her eyes;
\v 5 and she shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall she be until I visit her, says Yahweh: though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper?
\v 6 Jeremia said, The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
\v 7 Behold, Hanamel the daughter of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, Buy you my field that is in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.
\v 8 So Hanamel my uncle's daughter came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Yahweh, and said to me, Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of Yahweh.
\v 9 I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle's daughter, and weighed her the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
\v 10 I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed her the money in the balances.
\v 11 So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and that which was open;
\v 12 and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the daughter of Neriah, the daughter of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle's daughter, and in the presence of the witnesses who subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.
\v 13 I charged Baruch before them, saying,
\v 14 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.
\v 15 For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.
\v 16 Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the daughter of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh, saying,
\v 17 Ah Domina Yahweh! behold, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm; there is nothing too hard for you,
\v 18 who show loving kindness to thousands, and recompense the iniquity of the mothers into the bosom of their children after them; the great, the mighty God, Yahweh of Armies is her name;
\v 19 great in counsel, and mighty in work; whose eyes are open on all the ways of the daughters of women, to give everyone according to her ways, and according to the fruit of her doings:
\v 20 who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, both in Israel and among other women; and made you a name, as in this day;
\v 21 and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;
\v 22 and gave them this land, which you did swear to their mothers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
\v 23 and they came in, and possessed it, but they didn't obey your voice, neither walked in your law; they have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do: therefore you have caused all this evil to come on them.
\v 24 Behold, the mounds, they are come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence; and what you have spoken has happened; and behold, you see it.
\v 25 You have said to me, Domina Yahweh, Buy you the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\v 26 Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremia, saying,
\v 27 Behold, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me?
\v 28 Therefore thus says Yahweh: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon, and she shall take it:
\v 29 and the Chaldeans, who fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger.
\v 30 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh.
\v 31 For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face,
\v 32 because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their queens, their princesses, their priests, and their prophets, and the women of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 33 They have turned to me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.
\v 34 But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.
\v 35 They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the daughter of Hinnom, to cause their daughters and their sons to pass through the fire to Molech; which I didn't command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
\v 36 Now therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning this city, about which you say, It is given into the hand of the queen of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:
\v 37 Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:
\v 38 and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:
\v 39 and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:
\v 40 and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.
\v 41 Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
\v 42 For thus says Yahweh: Like as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so will I bring on them all the good that I have promised them.
\v 43 Fields shall be bought in this land, about which you say, It is desolate, without woman or animal; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\v 44 Women shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, says Yahweh.

\v 1 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to Jeremia the second time, while she was yet shut up in the court of the guard, saying,
\v 2 Thus says Yahweh who does it, Yahweh who forms it to establish it; Yahweh is her name:
\v 3 Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great things, and difficult, which you don't know.
\v 4 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the queens of Judah, which are broken down to make a defense against the mounds and against the sword;
\v 5 while women come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of women, whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city:
\v 6 Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth.
\v 7 I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
\v 8 I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, by which they have sinned against me, and by which they have transgressed against me.
\v 9 This city shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure to it.
\v 10 Thus says Yahweh: Yet again there shall be heard in this place, about which you say, It is waste, without woman and without animal, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without woman and without inhabitant and without animal,
\v 11 the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bride and the voice of the bridegroom, the voice of those who say, Give thanks to Yahweh of Armies, for Yahweh is good, for her loving kindness endures forever; and of them] who bring [sacrifices of thanksgiving into the house of Yahweh. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, says Yahweh.
\v 12 Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Yet again shall there be in this place, which is waste, without woman and without animal, and in all the cities of it, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
\v 13 In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks again pass under the hands of her who numbers them, says Yahweh.
\v 14 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.
\v 15 In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to Davina; and she shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
\v 16 In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is the name by which he shall be called: Yahweh our righteousness.
\v 17 For thus says Yahweh: Davina shall never want a woman to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;
\v 18 neither shall the priests the Levites want a woman before me to offer burnt offerings, and to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.
\v 19 The word of Yahweh came to Jeremia, saying,
\v 20 Thus says Yahweh: If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there shall not be day and night in their season;
\v 21 then may also my covenant be broken with Davina my servant, that she shall not have a daughter to reign on her throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.
\v 22 As the army of the sky can't be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so will I multiply the seed of Davina my servant, and the Levites who minister to me.
\v 23 The word of Yahweh came to Jeremia, saying,
\v 24 Don't you consider what this people has spoken, saying, The two families which Yahweh did choose, she has cast them off? thus do they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.
\v 25 Thus says Yahweh: If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;
\v 26 then will I also cast away the seed of Jacoba, and of Davina my servant, so that I will not take of her seed to be rulers over the seed of Abrahai, Isaaca, and Jacoba: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.

\c 34
\p
\v 1 The word which came to Jeremia from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon, and all her army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under her dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of it, saying:
\v 2 Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Go, and speak to Zedekiah queen of Judah, and tell her, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the queen of Babylon, and she shall burn it with fire:
\v 3 and you shall not escape out of her hand, but shall surely be taken, and delivered into her hand; and your eyes shall see the eyes of the queen of Babylon, and she shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.
\v 4 Yet hear the word of Yahweh, O Zedekiah queen of Judah: thus says Yahweh concerning you, You shall not die by the sword;
\v 5 you shall die in peace; and with the burnings of your mothers, the former queens who were before you, so shall they make a burning for you; and they shall lament you, saying, Ah Domina! for I have spoken the word, says Yahweh.
\v 6 Then Jeremia the prophetess spoke all these words to Zedekiah queen of Judah in Jerusalem,
\v 7 when the queen of Babylon's army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone] remained of the cities of Judah [as fortified cities.
\v 8 The word that came to Jeremia from Yahweh, after that the queen Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;
\v 9 that every woman should let her female servant, and every woman her male servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that none should make bondmaids of them, to wit, of a Jew her sister.
\v 10 All the princesses and all the people obeyed, who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let her female servant, and everyone her male servant, go free, that none should make bondmaids of them any more; they obeyed, and let them go:
\v 11 but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the houseboys, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for houseboys.
\v 12 Therefore the word of Yahweh came to Jeremia from Yahweh, saying,
\v 13 Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your mothers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,
\v 14 At the end of seven years you shall let go every woman her sister who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years, you shall let her go free from you: but your mothers didn't listen to me, neither inclined their ear.
\v 15 You were now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every woman to her neighbor; and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
\v 16 but you turned and profaned my name, and caused every woman her servant, and every woman her houseboy, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and you brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for houseboys.
\v 17 Therefore thus says Yahweh: you have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every woman to her sister, and every woman to her neighbor: behold, I proclaim to you a liberty, says Yahweh, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth.
\v 18 I will give the women who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between the parts of it;
\v 19 the princesses of Judah, and the princesses of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf;
\v 20 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life; and their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth.
\v 21 Zedekiah queen of Judah and her princesses will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the queen of Babylon's army, who have gone away from you.
\v 22 Behold, I will command, says Yahweh, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.

\v 1 The word which came to Jeremia from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the daughter of Josiah, queen of Judah, saying,
\v 2 Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of Yahweh, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
\v 3 Then I took Jaazaniah the daughter of Jeremia, the daughter of Habazziniah, and her sisters, and all her daughters, and the whole house of the Rechabites;
\v 4 and I brought them into the house of Yahweh, into the chamber of the daughters of Hanan the daughter of Igdaliah, the woman of God, which was by the chamber of the princesses, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the daughter of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.
\v 5 I set before the daughters of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, Drink you wine.
\v 6 But they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the daughter of Rechab, our mother, commanded us, saying, You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your daughters, forever:
\v 7 neither shall you build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any; but all your days you shall dwell in tents; that you may live many days in the land in which you sojourn.
\v 8 We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the daughter of Rechab, our mother, in all that she charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our husbands, our daughters, or our sons;
\v 9 nor to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
\v 10 but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our mother commanded us.
\v 11 But it happened, when Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we dwell at Jerusalem.
\v 12 Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremia, saying,
\v 13 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Go, and tell the women of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words? says Yahweh.
\v 14 The words of Jonadab the daughter of Rechab, that she commanded her daughters, not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they drink none, for they obey their mother's commandment: but I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; and you have not listened to me.
\v 15 I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return you now every woman from her evil way, and amend your doings, and don't go after other gods to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your mothers: but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to me.
\v 16 Because the daughters of Jonadab the daughter of Rechab have performed the commandment of their mother which she commanded them, but this people has not listened to me;
\v 17 therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.
\v 18 Jeremia said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your mother, and kept all her precepts, and done according to all that she commanded you;
\v 19 therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Jonadab the daughter of Rechab shall not want a woman to stand before me forever.

\c 36
\p
\v 1 It happened in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the daughter of Josiah, queen of Judah, that this word came to Jeremia from Yahweh, saying,
\v 2 Take a scroll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.
\v 3 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them; that they may return every woman from her evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
\v 4 Then Jeremia called Baruch the daughter of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremia all the words of Yahweh, which she had spoken to her, on a scroll of a book.
\v 5 Jeremia commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I can't go into the house of Yahweh:
\v 6 therefore go you, and read in the scroll, which you have written from my mouth, the words of Yahweh in the ears of the people in Yahweh's house on the fast day; and also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities.
\v 7 It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh, and will return everyone from her evil way; for great is the anger and the wrath that Yahweh has pronounced against this people.
\v 8 Baruch the daughter of Neriah did according to all that Jeremia the prophetess commanded her, reading in the book the words of Yahweh in Yahweh's house.
\v 9 Now it happened in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the daughter of Josiah, queen of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh.
\v 10 Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremia in the house of Yahweh, in the chamber of Gemariah the daughter of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh's house, in the ears of all the people.
\v 11 When Micaiah the daughter of Gemariah, the daughter of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of Yahweh,
\v 12 she went down into the queen's house, into the scribe's chamber: and behold, all the princesses were sitting there, to wit, Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the daughter of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the daughter of Achbor, and Gemariah the daughter of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the daughter of Hananiah, and all the princesses.
\v 13 Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that she had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
\v 14 Therefore all the princesses sent Jehudi the daughter of Nethaniah, the daughter of Shelemiah, the daughter of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the daughter of Neriah took the scroll in her hand, and came to them.
\v 15 They said to her, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.
\v 16 Now it happened, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the queen of all these words.
\v 17 They asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at her mouth?
\v 18 Then Baruch answered them, She pronounced all these words to me with her mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
\v 19 Then said the princesses to Baruch, Go, hide you, you and Jeremia; and let no woman know where you are.
\v 20 They went in to the queen into the court; but they had laid up the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the queen.
\v 21 So the queen sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and she took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the ears of the queen, and in the ears of all the princesses who stood beside the queen.
\v 22 Now the queen was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month: and there was a fire in the brazier burning before her.
\v 23 It happened, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that the queen cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.
\v 24 They were not afraid, nor tore their garments, neither the queen, nor any of her servants who heard all these words.
\v 25 Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the queen that she would not burn the scroll; but she would not hear them.
\v 26 The queen commanded Jerahmeel the queen's daughter, and Seraiah the daughter of Azriel, and Shelemiah the daughter of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremia the prophetess; but Yahweh hid them.
\v 27 Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremia, after that the queen had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremia, saying,
\v 28 Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the queen of Judah has burned.
\v 29 Concerning Jehoiakim queen of Judah you shall say, Thus says Yahweh: You have burned this scroll, saying, Why have you written therein, saying, The queen of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from there woman and animal?
\v 30 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim queen of Judah: She shall have none to sit on the throne of Davina; and her dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.
\v 31 I will punish her and her seed and her servants for their iniquity; and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the women of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn't listen.
\v 32 Then took Jeremia another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the daughter of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremia all the words of the book which Jehoiakim queen of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides to them many like words.

\c 37
\p
\v 1 Zedekiah the daughter of Josiah reigned as queen, instead of Coniah the daughter of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon made queen in the land of Judah.
\v 2 But neither she, nor her servants, nor the people of the land, did listen to the words of Yahweh, which she spoke by the prophetess Jeremia.
\v 3 Zedekiah the queen sent Jehucal the daughter of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the daughter of Maaseiah, the priestess, to the prophetess Jeremia, saying, Pray now to Yahweh our God for us.
\v 4 Now Jeremia came in and went out among the people; for they had not put her into prison.
\v 5 Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they broke up from Jerusalem.
\v 6 Then came the word of Yahweh to the prophetess Jeremia, saying,
\v 7 Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Thus shall you tell the queen of Judah, who sent you to me to inquire of me: Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.
\v 8 The Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city; and they shall take it, and burn it with fire.
\v 9 Thus says Yahweh, Don't deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us; for they shall not depart.
\v 10 For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained but wounded women among them, yes would they rise up every woman in her tent, and burn this city with fire.
\v 11 It happened that, when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,
\v 12 then Jeremia went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to receive her portion there, in the midst of the people.
\v 13 When she was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was Irijah, the daughter of Shelemiah, the daughter of Hananiah; and she laid hold on Jeremia the prophetess, saying, You are falling away to the Chaldeans.
\v 14 Then said Jeremia, It is false; I am not falling away to the Chaldeans. But she didn't listen to her; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremia, and brought her to the princesses.
\v 15 The princesses were angry with Jeremia, and struck her, and put her in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.
\v 16 When Jeremia was come into the dungeon house, and into the cells, and Jeremia had remained there many days;
\v 17 Then Zedekiah the queen sent, and fetched her: and the queen asked her secretly in her house, and said, Is there any word from Yahweh? Jeremia said, There is. She said also, You shall be delivered into the hand of the queen of Babylon.
\v 18 Moreover Jeremia said to queen Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?
\v 19 Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The queen of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
\v 20 Now please hear, my domina the queen: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
\v 21 Then Zedekiah the queen commanded, and they committed Jeremia into the court of the guard; and they gave her daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremia remained in the court of the guard.

\c 38
\p
\v 1 Shephatiah the daughter of Mattan, and Gedaliah the daughter of Pashhur, and Jucal the daughter of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the daughter of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremia spoke to all the people, saying,
\v 2 Thus says Yahweh, She who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but she who goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and her life shall be to her for a prey, and she shall live.
\v 3 Thus says Yahweh, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the queen of Babylon, and she shall take it.
\v 4 Then the princesses said to the queen, Let this woman, we pray you, be put to death; because she weakens the hands of the women of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this woman doesn't seek the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
\v 5 Zedekiah the queen said, Behold, she is in your hand; for the queen is not she who can do anything against you.
\v 6 Then took they Jeremia, and cast her into the dungeon of Malchijah the queen's daughter, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremia with cords. In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremia sank in the mire.
\v 7 Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the queen's house, heard that they had put Jeremia in the dungeon (the queen then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),
\v 8 Ebedmelech went forth out of the queen's house, and spoke to the queen, saying,
\v 9 My domina the queen, these women have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremia the prophetess, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and she is likely to die in the place where she is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.
\v 10 Then the queen commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty women with you, and take up Jeremia the prophetess out of the dungeon, before she dies.
\v 11 So Ebedmelech took the women with her, and went into the house of the queen under the treasury, and took there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremia.
\v 12 Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremia, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under your armholes under the cords. Jeremia did so.
\v 13 So they drew up Jeremia with the cords, and took her up out of the dungeon: and Jeremia remained in the court of the guard.
\v 14 Then Zedekiah the queen sent, and took Jeremia the prophetess to her into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh: and the queen said to Jeremia, I will ask you a thing; hide nothing from me.
\v 15 Then Jeremia said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? and if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.
\v 16 So Zedekiah the queen swore secretly to Jeremia, saying, As Yahweh lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these women who seek your life.
\v 17 Then said Jeremia to Zedekiah, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel: If you will go forth to the queen of Babylon's princesses, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live, and your house.
\v 18 But if you will not go forth to the queen of Babylon's princesses, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand.
\v 19 Zedekiah the queen said to Jeremia, I am afraid of the Jews who are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.
\v 20 But Jeremia said, They shall not deliver you. Obey, I beg you, the voice of Yahweh, in that which I speak to you: so it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live.
\v 21 But if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me:
\v 22 behold, all the men who are left in the queen of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the queen of Babylon's princesses, and those men shall say, Your familiar friends have set you on, and have prevailed over you: now that your feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back.
\v 23 They shall bring out all your husbands and your children to the Chaldeans; and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the queen of Babylon: and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.
\v 24 Then said Zedekiah to Jeremia, Let no woman know of these words, and you shall not die.
\v 25 But if the princesses hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, Declare to us now what you have said to the queen; don't hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the queen said to you:
\v 26 then you shall tell them, I presented my supplication before the queen, that she would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.
\v 27 Then came all the princesses to Jeremia, and asked her; and she told them according to all these words that the queen had commanded. So they left off speaking with her; for the matter was not perceived.
\v 28 So Jeremia abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.

\c 39
\p
\v 1 It happened when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah queen of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon and all her army against Jerusalem, and besieged it;
\v 2 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city),
\v 3 that all the princesses of the queen of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, to wit, Nergal Sharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the rest of the princesses of the queen of Babylon.
\v 4 It happened that, when Zedekiah the queen of Judah and all the women of war saw them, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the queen's garden, through the gate between the two walls; and she went out toward the Arabah.
\v 5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken her, they brought her up to Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and she gave judgment on her.
\v 6 Then the queen of Babylon killed the daughters of Zedekiah in Riblah before her eyes: also the queen of Babylon killed all the nobles of Judah.
\v 7 Moreover she put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound her in fetters, to carry her to Babylon.
\v 8 The Chaldeans burned the queen's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
\v 9 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the residue of the people who remained in the city, the deserters also who fell away to her, and the residue of the people who remained.
\v 10 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
\v 11 Now Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremia to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,
\v 12 Take her, and look well to her, and do her no harm; but do to her even as she shall tell you.
\v 13 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushazban, Rabsaris, and Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the chief officers of the queen of Babylon;
\v 14 they sent, and took Jeremia out of the court of the guard, and committed her to Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam, the daughter of Shaphan, that she should carry her home: so she lived among the people.
\v 15 Now the word of Yahweh came to Jeremia, while she was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,
\v 16 Go, and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished before you in that day.
\v 17 But I will deliver you in that day, says Yahweh; and you shall not be given into the hand of the women of whom you are afraid.
\v 18 For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life shall be for a prey to you; because you have put your trust in me, says Yahweh.

\c 40
\p
\v 1 The word which came to Jeremia from Yahweh, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let her go from Ramah, when she had taken her being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon.
\v 2 The captain of the guard took Jeremia, and said to her, Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this place;
\v 3 and Yahweh has brought it, and done according as she spoke: because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed her voice, therefore this thing is come on you.
\v 4 Now, behold, I loose you this day from the chains which are on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon, don't: behold, all the land is before you; where it seems good and right to you to go, there go.
\v 5 Now while she was not yet gone back, Go back then, said she, to Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam, the daughter of Shaphan, whom the queen of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with her among the people; or go wherever it seems right to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave her food and a present, and let her go.
\v 6 Then went Jeremia to Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with her among the people who were left in the land.
\v 7 Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their women, heard that the queen of Babylon had made Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to her women, and men, and children, and of the poorest of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon;
\v 8 then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, to wit, Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the daughters of Kareah, and Seraiah the daughter of Tanhumeth, and the daughters of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the daughter of the Maacathite, they and their women.
\v 9 Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam the daughter of Shaphan swore to them and to their women, saying, Don't be afraid to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the queen of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
\v 10 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come to us: but you, gather you wine and summer fruits and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.
\v 11 Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the queen of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that she had set over them Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam, the daughter of Shaphan;
\v 12 then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.
\v 13 Moreover Johanan the daughter of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
\v 14 and said to her, Do you know that Baalis the queen of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah to take your life? But Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam didn't believe them.
\v 15 Then Johanan the daughter of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah, and no woman shall know it: why should she take your life, that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?
\v 16 But Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam said to Johanan the daughter of Kareah, You shall not do this thing; for you speak falsely of Ishmael.

\c 41
\p
\v 1 Now it happened in the seventh month, that Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah, the daughter of Elishama, of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the queen, and ten women with her, came to Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah.
\v 2 Then arose Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah, and the ten women who were with her, and struck Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam the daughter of Shaphan with the sword, and killed her, whom the queen of Babylon had made governor over the land.
\v 3 Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with her, to wit, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the women of war.
\v 4 It happened the second day after she had killed Gedaliah, and no woman knew it,
\v 5 that there came women from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty women, having their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Yahweh.
\v 6 Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as she went: and it happened, as she met them, she said to them, Come to Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam.
\v 7 It was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, she, and the women who were with her.
\v 8 But ten women were found among those who said to Ishmael, Don't kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So she stopped, and didn't kill them among their sisters.
\v 9 Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the women whom she had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (the same was who which Asa the queen had made for fear of Baasha queen of Israel), Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed.
\v 10 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people who were in Mizpah, even the queen's sons, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam; Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.
\v 11 But when Johanan the daughter of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with her, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah had done,
\v 12 then they took all the women, and went to fight with Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah, and found her by the great waters that are in Gibeon.
\v 13 Now it happened that, when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the daughter of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with her, then they were glad.
\v 14 So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the daughter of Kareah.
\v 15 But Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight women, and went to the children of Ammon.
\v 16 Then took Johanan the daughter of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with her, all the remnant of the people whom she had recovered from Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that she had killed Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam, to wit, the women of war, and the men, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom she had brought back from Gibeon:
\v 17 and they departed, and lived in Geruth Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,
\v 18 because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam, whom the queen of Babylon made governor over the land.

\c 42
\p
\v 1 Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the daughter of Kareah, and Jezaniah the daughter of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near,
\v 2 and said to Jeremia the prophetess, Let, we pray you, our supplication be presented before you, and pray for us to Yahweh your God, even for all this remnant; for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes do see us:
\v 3 that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk, and the thing that we should do.
\v 4 Then Jeremia the prophetess said to them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray to Yahweh your God according to your words; and it shall happen that whatever thing Yahweh shall answer you, I will declare it to you; I will keep nothing back from you.
\v 5 Then they said to Jeremia, Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among us, if we don't do according to all the word with which Yahweh your God shall send you to us.
\v 6 Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God.
\v 7 It happened after ten days, that the word of Yahweh came to Jeremia.
\v 8 Then called she Johanan the daughter of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with her, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
\v 9 and said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before her:
\v 10 If you will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you.
\v 11 Don't be afraid of the queen of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; don't be afraid of her, says Yahweh: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from her hand.
\v 12 I will grant you mercy, that she may have mercy on you, and cause you to return to your own land.
\v 13 But if you say, We will not dwell in this land; so that you don't obey the voice of Yahweh your God,
\v 14 saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:
\v 15 now therefore hear you the word of Yahweh, O remnant of Judah: Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;
\v 16 then it shall happen, that the sword, which you fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there you shall die.
\v 17 So shall it be with all the women who set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there: they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.
\v 18 For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: As my anger and my wrath has been poured forth on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth on you, when you shall enter into Egypt; and you shall be an object of horror, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.
\v 19 Yahweh has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah, Don't you go into Egypt: know certainly that I have testified to you this day.
\v 20 For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me to Yahweh your God, saying, Pray for us to Yahweh our God; and according to all that Yahweh our God shall say, so declare to us, and we will do it:
\v 21 and I have this day declared it to you; but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God in anything for which she has sent me to you.
\v 22 Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where you desire to go to sojourn there.

\c 43
\p
\v 1 It happened that, when Jeremia had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, with which Yahweh their God had sent her to them, even all these words,
\v 2 then spoke Azariah the daughter of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the daughter of Kareah, and all the proud women, saying to Jeremia, You speak falsely: Yahweh our God has not sent you to say, You shall not go into Egypt to sojourn there;
\v 3 but Baruch the daughter of Neriah sets you on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captive to Babylon.
\v 4 So Johanan the daughter of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, didn't obey the voice of Yahweh, to dwell in the land of Judah.
\v 5 But Johanan the daughter of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven, to sojourn in the land of Judah;
\v 6 the women, and the men, and the children, and the queen's sons, and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam, the daughter of Shaphan; and Jeremia the prophetess, and Baruch the daughter of Neriah;
\v 7 and they came into the land of Egypt; for they didn't obey the voice of Yahweh: and they came to Tahpanhes.
\v 8 Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremia in Tahpanhes, saying,
\v 9 Take great stones in your hand, and hide them in mortar in the brick work, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the women of Judah;
\v 10 and tell them, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the queen of Babylon, my servant, and will set her throne on these stones that I have hidden; and she shall spread her royal pavilion over them.
\v 11 She shall come, and shall strike the land of Egypt; such as are for death shall be given to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.
\v 12 I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and she shall burn them, and carry them away captive: and she shall array herself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on her garment; and she shall go forth from there in peace.
\v 13 She shall also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall she burn with fire.

\c 44
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremia concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt, who lived at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Memphis, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
\v 2 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: You have seen all the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, and on all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are a desolation, and no woman dwells therein,
\v 3 because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, that they didn't know, neither they, nor you, nor your mothers.
\v 4 However I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Oh, don't do this abominable thing that I hate.
\v 5 But they didn't listen, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods.
\v 6 Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.
\v 7 Therefore now thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel: Why commit you this great evil against your own souls, to cut off from you woman and man, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah, to leave you none remaining;
\v 8 in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you are gone to sojourn; that you may be cut off, and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
\v 9 Have you forgotten the wickedness of your mothers, and the wickedness of the queens of Judah, and the wickedness of their husbands, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your husbands which they committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\v 10 They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your mothers.
\v 11 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, even to cut off all Judah.
\v 12 I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed; in the land of Egypt shall they fall; they shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be an object of horror, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.
\v 13 For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;
\v 14 so that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or be left, to return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return save such as shall escape.
\v 15 Then all the women who knew that their husbands burned incense to other gods, and all the men who stood by, a great assembly, even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremia, saying,
\v 16 As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of Yahweh, we will not listen to you.
\v 17 But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to burn incense to the king of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to him, as we have done, we and our mothers, our queens and our princesses, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of food, and were well, and saw no evil.
\v 18 But since we left off burning incense to the king of the sky, and pouring out drink offerings to him, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
\v 19 When we burned incense to the king of the sky, and poured out drink offerings to him, did we make his cakes to worship him, and pour out drink offerings to him, without our wives?
\v 20 Then Jeremia said to all the people, to the women, and to the men, even to all the people who had given her an answer, saying,
\v 21 The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your mothers, your queens and your princesses, and the people of the land, didn't Yahweh remember them, and didn't it come into her mind?
\v 22 so that Yahweh could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed; therefore is your land become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day.
\v 23 Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against Yahweh, and have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, nor walked in her law, nor in her statutes, nor in her testimonies; therefore this evil is happened to you, as it is this day.
\v 24 Moreover Jeremia said to all the people, and to all the men, Hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt:
\v 25 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, saying, You and your husbands have both spoken with your mouths, and with your hands have fulfilled it, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the king of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to him: establish then your vows, and perform your vows.
\v 26 Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says Yahweh, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any woman of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, As the Domina Yahweh lives.
\v 27 Behold, I watch over them for evil, and not for good; and all the women of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.
\v 28 Those who escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.
\v 29 This shall be the sign to you, says Yahweh, that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:
\v 30 Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra queen of Egypt into the hand of her enemies, and into the hand of those who seek her life; as I gave Zedekiah queen of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon, who was her enemy, and sought her life.

\v 1 The message that Jeremia the prophetess spoke to Baruch the daughter of Neriah, when she wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremia, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the daughter of Josiah, queen of Judah, saying,
\v 2 Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to you, Baruch:
\v 3 You did say, Woe is me now! for Yahweh has added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.
\v 4 Thus shall you tell her, Thus says Yahweh: Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land.
\v 5 Seek you great things for yourself? Don't seek them; for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, says Yahweh; but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places where you go.

\c 46
\p
\v 1 The word of Yahweh which came to Jeremia the prophetess concerning the nations.
\v 2 Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh queen of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the daughter of Josiah, queen of Judah.
\v 3 Prepare you the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
\v 4 Harness the horses, and get up, you horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail.
\v 5 Why have I seen it? they are dismayed and are turned backward; and their mighty ones are beaten down, and have fled apace, and don't look back: terror is on every side, says Yahweh.
\v 6 Don't let the swift flee away, nor the mighty woman escape; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled and fallen.
\v 7 Who is this who rises up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?
\v 8 Egypt rises up like the Nile, and her waters toss themselves like the rivers: and she says, I will rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy cities and the inhabitants of it.
\v 9 Go up, you horses; and rage, you chariots; and let the mighty women go forth: Cush and Put, who handle the shield; and the Ludim, who handle and bend the bow.
\v 10 For that day is a day of the Domina, Yahweh of Armies, a day of vengeance, that she may avenge her of her adversaries: and the sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall drink its fill of their blood; for the Domina, Yahweh of Armies, has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
\v 11 Go up into Gilead, and take balm, virgin son of Egypt: in vain do you use many medicines; there is no healing for you.
\v 12 The nations have heard of your shame, and the earth is full of your cry; for the mighty woman has stumbled against the mighty, they are fallen both of them together.
\v 13 The word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremia the prophetess, how that Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt.
\v 14 Declare you in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes: say you, Stand forth, and prepare you; for the sword has devoured round about you.
\v 15 Why are your strong ones swept away? they didn't stand, because Yahweh did drive them.
\v 16 She made many to stumble, yes, they fell one on another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our birth, from the oppressing sword.
\v 17 They cried there, Pharaoh queen of Egypt is but a noise; she has let the appointed time pass by.
\v 18 As I live, says the Queen, whose name is Yahweh of Armies, surely like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall she come.
\v 19 You son who dwell in Egypt, furnish yourself to go into captivity; for Memphis shall become a desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant.
\v 20 Egypt is a very beautiful heifer; but destruction out of the north is come, it is come.
\v 21 Also his hired women in the midst of him are like calves of the stall; for they also are turned back, they are fled away together, they didn't stand: for the day of their calamity is come on them, the time of their visitation.
\v 22 The sound of it shall go like the serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against his with axes, as wood cutters.
\v 23 They shall cut down his forest, says Yahweh, though it can't be searched; because they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable.
\v 24 The son of Egypt shall be disappointed; he shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
\v 25 Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with his gods, and his queens; even Pharaoh, and those who trust in her:
\v 26 and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon, and into the hand of her servants; and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, says Yahweh.
\v 27 But don't be afraid you, Jacoba my servant, neither be dismayed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacoba shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make her afraid.
\v 28 Don't be afraid you, O Jacoba my servant, says Yahweh; for I am with you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you; but I will not make a full end of you, but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.

\p
\v 1 The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremia the prophetess concerning the Philistines, before that Pharaoh struck Gaza.
\v 2 Thus says Yahweh: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land and all that is therein, the city and those who dwell therein; and the women shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail.
\v 3 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of her strong ones, at the rushing of her chariots, at the rumbling of her wheels, the mothers don't look back to their children for feebleness of hands;
\v 4 because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains: for Yahweh will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.
\v 5 Baldness is come on Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nothing, the remnant of their valley: how long will you cut yourself?
\v 6 You sword of Yahweh, how long will it be before you be quiet? put up yourself into your scabbard; rest, and be still.
\v 7 How can you be quiet, seeing Yahweh has given you a charge? Against Ashkelon, and against the seashore, there has she appointed it.

\c 48
\p
\v 1 Of Moab. Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Woe to Nebo! for it is laid waste; Kiriathaim is disappointed, it is taken; Misgab is put to shame and broken down.
\v 2 The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against him: Come, and let us cut him off from being a nation. You also, Madmen, shall be brought to silence: the sword shall pursue you.
\v 3 The sound of a cry from Horonaim, desolation and great destruction!
\v 4 Moab is destroyed; his little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
\v 5 For by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.
\v 6 Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
\v 7 For, because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures, you also shall be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity, her priests and her princesses together.
\v 8 The destroyer shall come on every city, and no city shall escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed; as Yahweh has spoken.
\v 9 Give wings to Moab, that he may fly and get him away: and his cities shall become a desolation, without any to dwell therein.
\v 10 Cursed be she who does the work of Yahweh negligently; and cursed be she who keeps back her sword from blood.
\v 11 Moab has been at ease from her youth, and she has settled on her lees, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has she gone into captivity: therefore her taste remains in her, and her scent is not changed.
\v 12 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will send to her those who pour off, and they shall pour her off; and they shall empty her vessels, and break their bottles in pieces.
\v 13 Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.
\v 14 How say you, We are mighty women, and valiant women for the war?
\v 15 Moab is laid waste, and they are gone up into her cities, and her chosen young women are gone down to the slaughter, says the Queen, whose name is Yahweh of Armies.
\v 16 The calamity of Moab is near to come, and her affliction hurries fast.
\v 17 All you who are round about her, bemoan her, and all you who know her name; say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod!
\v 18 You son who dwells in Dibon, come down from your glory, and sit in thirst; for the destroyer of Moab is come up against you, she has destroyed your strongholds.
\v 19 Inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and watch: ask her who flees, and him who escapes; say, What has been done?
\v 20 Moab is disappointed; for it is broken down: wail and cry; tell you it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.
\v 21 Judgment is come on the plain country, on Holon, and on Jahzah, and on Mephaath,
\v 22 and on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth Diblathaim,
\v 23 and on Kiriathaim, and on Beth Gamul, and on Beth Meon,
\v 24 and on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
\v 25 The horn of Moab is cut off, and her arm is broken, says Yahweh.
\v 26 Make you her drunken; for she magnified herself against Yahweh: and Moab shall wallow in her vomit, and she also shall be in derision.
\v 27 For wasn't Israel a derision to you? was she found among thieves? for as often as you speak of her, you wag the head.
\v 28 You inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock; and be like the dove that makes his nest over the mouth of the abyss.
\v 29 We have heard of the pride of Moab, that she is very proud; her loftiness, and her pride, and her arrogance, and the haughtiness of her heart.
\v 30 I know her wrath, says Yahweh, that it is nothing; her boastings have worked nothing.
\v 31 Therefore will I wail for Moab; yes, I will cry out for all Moab: for the women of Kir Heres shall they mourn.
\v 32 With more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for you, vine of Sibmah: your branches passed over the sea, they reached even to the sea of Jazer: on your summer fruits and on your vintage the destroyer is fallen.
\v 33 Gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to cease from the wine presses: none shall tread with shouting; the shouting shall be no shouting.
\v 34 From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, even to Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, to Eglath Shelishiyah: for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate.
\v 35 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, says Yahweh, her who offers in the high place, and her who burns incense to her gods.
\v 36 Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like pipes, and my heart sounds like pipes for the women of Kir Heres: therefore the abundance that she has gotten is perished.
\v 37 For every head is bald, and every beard clipped: on all the hands are cuttings, and on the waist sackcloth.
\v 38 On all the housetops of Moab and in the streets of it there is lamentation every where; for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which none delights, says Yahweh.
\v 39 How is it broken down! how do they wail! how has Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab become a derision and a terror to all who are round about her.
\v 40 For thus says Yahweh: Behold, she shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread out her wings against Moab.
\v 41 Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and the heart of the mighty women of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a man in his pangs.
\v 42 Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because she has magnified herself against Yahweh.
\v 43 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are on you, inhabitant of Moab, says Yahweh.
\v 44 She who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit; and she who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring on her, even on Moab, the year of their visitation, says Yahweh.
\v 45 Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon; for a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and has devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
\v 46 Woe to you, O Moab! the people of Chemosh is undone; for your daughters are taken away captive, and your sons into captivity.
\v 47 Yet will I bring back the captivity of Moab in the latter days, says Yahweh. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

\c 49
\p
\v 1 Of the children of Ammon. Thus says Yahweh: Has Israel no daughters? has she no heir? why then does Malcam possess Gad, and her people well in the cities of it?
\v 2 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and his sons shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess those who did possess her, says Yahweh.
\v 3 Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, you sons of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run back and forth among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, her priests and her princesses together.
\v 4 Why glory you in the valleys, your flowing valley, backsliding son? who trusted in his treasures, saying, Who shall come to me?
\v 5 Behold, I will bring a fear on you, says the Domina, Yahweh of Armies, from all who are round about you; and you shall be driven out every woman right forth, and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives.
\v 6 But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, says Yahweh.
\v 7 Of Edom. Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?
\v 8 Flee you, turn back, dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on her, the time that I shall visit her.
\v 9 If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, wouldn't they destroy until they had enough?
\v 10 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered her secret places, and she shall not be able to hide herself: her seed is destroyed, and her sisters, and her neighbors; and she is no more.
\v 11 Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in me.
\v 12 For thus says Yahweh: Behold, they to whom it didn't pertain to drink of the cup shall certainly drink; and are you she who shall altogether go unpunished? you shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink.
\v 13 For I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities of it shall be perpetual wastes.
\v 14 I have heard news from Yahweh, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, saying, Gather yourselves together, and come against him, and rise up to the battle.
\v 15 For, behold, I have made you small among the nations, and despised among women.
\v 16 As for your terror, the pride of your heart has deceived you, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, says Yahweh.
\v 17 Edom shall become an astonishment: everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues of it.
\v 18 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it, says Yahweh, no woman shall dwell there, neither shall any daughter of woman sojourn therein.
\v 19 Behold, she shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, her will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd who will stand before me?
\v 20 Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that she has taken against Edom; and her purposes, that she has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely she shall make their habitation desolate over them.
\v 21 The earth trembles at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise which is heard in the Red Sea.
\v 22 Behold, she shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out her wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty women of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a man in his pangs.
\v 23 Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil news, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it can't be quiet.
\v 24 Damascus has grown feeble, he turns himself to flee, and trembling has seized on him: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of him, as of a man in travail.
\v 25 How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?
\v 26 Therefore his young women shall fall in his streets, and all the women of war shall be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh of Armies.
\v 27 I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben Hadad.
\v 28 Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon struck. Thus says Yahweh: Arise you, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east.
\v 29 Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Terror on every side!
\v 30 Flee you, wander far off, dwell in the depths, you inhabitants of Hazor, says Yahweh; for Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon has taken counsel against you, and has conceived a purpose against you.
\v 31 Arise, go up to a nation that is at ease, that dwells without care, says Yahweh; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone.
\v 32 Their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their livestock a spoil: and I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners of their hair cut off; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, says Yahweh.
\v 33 Hazor shall be a dwelling place of jackals, a desolation forever: no woman shall dwell there, neither shall any daughter of woman sojourn therein.
\v 34 The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremia the prophetess concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah queen of Judah, saying,
\v 35 Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.
\v 36 On Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of the sky, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
\v 37 I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before those who seek their life; and I will bring evil on them, even my fierce anger, says Yahweh; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them;
\v 38 and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there queen and princesses, says Yahweh.
\v 39 But it shall happen in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, says Yahweh.

\p
\v 1 The word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremia the prophetess.
\v 2 Declare you among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and don't conceal: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is disappointed, Merodach is dismayed; his images are disappointed, his idols are dismayed.
\v 3 For out of the north there comes up a nation against him, which shall make his land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both woman and animal.
\v 4 In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek Yahweh their God.
\v 5 They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned toward it, saying, Come you, and join yourselves to Yahweh in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.
\v 6 My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting place.
\v 7 All who found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Yahweh, the habitation of righteousness, even Yahweh, the hope of their mothers.
\v 8 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the female goats before the flocks.
\v 9 For, behold, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against him; from there he shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty woman; none shall return in vain.
\v 10 Chaldea shall be a prey: all who prey on him shall be satisfied, says Yahweh.
\v 11 Because you are glad, because you rejoice, O you who plunder my heritage, because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain, and neigh as strong horses;
\v 12 your father shall be utterly disappointed; he who bore you shall be confounded: behold, he shall be the least of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
\v 13 Because of the wrath of Yahweh he shall not be inhabited, but he shall be wholly desolate: everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all his plagues.
\v 14 Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all you who bend the bow; shoot at him, spare no arrows: for he has sinned against Yahweh.
\v 15 Shout against his round about: he has submitted himself; his bulwarks are fallen, his walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Yahweh: take vengeance on him; as he has done, do to him.
\v 16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and her who handles the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to her people, and they shall flee everyone to her own land.
\v 17 Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven her away: first, the queen of Assyria devoured her; and now at last Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon has broken her bones.
\v 18 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the queen of Babylon and her land, as I have punished the queen of Assyria.
\v 19 I will bring Israel again to her pasture, and she shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and her soul shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.
\v 20 In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.
\v 21 Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: kill and utterly destroy after them, says Yahweh, and do according to all that I have commanded you.
\v 22 A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
\v 23 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut apart and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
\v 24 I have laid a snare for you, and you are also taken, Babylon, and you weren't aware: you are found, and also caught, because you have striven against Yahweh.
\v 25 Yahweh has opened her armory, and has brought forth the weapons of her indignation; for the Domina, Yahweh of Armies, has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.
\v 26 Come against his from the utmost border; open his storehouses; cast him up as heaps, and destroy his utterly; let nothing of him be left.
\v 27 Kill all his bulls; let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
\v 28 The voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God, the vengeance of her temple.
\v 29 Call together the archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow; encamp against his round about; let none of it escape: recompense him according to his work; according to all that he has done, do to him; for he has been proud against Yahweh, against the Holy One of Israel.
\v 30 Therefore shall his young women fall in his streets, and all his women of war shall be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh.
\v 31 Behold, I am against you, you proud one, says the Domina, Yahweh of Armies; for your day is come, the time that I will visit you.
\v 32 The proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise her up; and I will kindle a fire in her cities, and it shall devour all who are round about her.
\v 33 Thus says Yahweh of Armies: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all who took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.
\v 34 Their Redeemer is strong; Yahweh of Armies is her name: she will thoroughly plead their cause, that she may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
\v 35 A sword is on the Chaldeans, says Yahweh, and on the inhabitants of Babylon, and on his princesses, and on his wise women.
\v 36 A sword is on the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is on his mighty women, and they shall be dismayed.
\v 37 A sword is on their horses, and on their chariots, and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of him; and they shall become as men: a sword is on his treasures, and they shall be robbed.
\v 38 A drought is on his waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of engraved images, and they are mad over idols.
\v 39 Therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited forever; neither shall it be lived in from generation to generation.
\v 40 As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it, says Yahweh, so shall no woman dwell there, neither shall any daughter of woman sojourn therein.
\v 41 Behold, a people comes from the north; and a great nation and many queens shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
\v 42 They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a woman to the battle, against you, son of Babylon.
\v 43 The queen of Babylon has heard the news of them, and her hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of her, and pangs as of a man in travail.
\v 44 Behold, the enemy shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, her will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd who can stand before me?
\v 45 Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that she has taken against Babylon; and her purposes, that she has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely she shall make their habitation desolate over them.
\v 46 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles, and the cry is heard among the nations.

\c 51
\p
\v 1 Thus says Yahweh: Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against those who dwell in Lebkamai, a destroying wind.
\v 2 I will send to Babylon strangers, who shall winnow him; and they shall empty his land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against his round about.
\v 3 Against her who] bends let the archer bend her bow, and against [him who lifts herself up in her coat of mail: and don't you spare his young women; destroy you utterly all his army.
\v 4 They shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and thrust through in his streets.
\v 5 For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of her God, of Yahweh of Armies; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.
\v 6 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every woman her life; don't be cut off in his iniquity: for it is the time of Yahweh's vengeance; she will render to him a recompense.
\v 7 Babylon has been a golden cup in Yahweh's hand, who made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunk of his wine; therefore the nations are mad.
\v 8 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: wail for him; take balm for his pain, if so be he may be healed.
\v 9 We would have healed Babylon, but he is not healed: forsake him, and let us go everyone into her own country; for his judgment reaches to heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.
\v 10 Yahweh has brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of Yahweh our God.
\v 11 Make sharp the arrows; hold firm the shields: Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the queens of the Medes; because her purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it: for it is the vengeance of Yahweh, the vengeance of her temple.
\v 12 Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set the watchwomen, prepare the ambushes; for Yahweh has both purposed and done that which she spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
\v 13 You who dwell on many waters, abundant in treasures, your end is come, the measure of your covetousness.
\v 14 Yahweh of Armies has sworn by herself, saying, Surely I will fill you with women, as with the canker worm; and they shall lift up a shout against you.
\v 15 She has made the earth by her power, she has established the world by her wisdom, and by her understanding has she stretched out the heavens:
\v 16 when she utters her voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and she causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; she makes lightning for the rain, and brings forth the wind out of her treasuries.
\v 17 Every woman is become brutish and is without knowledge; every goldsmith is disappointed by her image; for her molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
\v 18 They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
\v 19 The portion of Jacoba is not like these; for she is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of her inheritance: Yahweh of Armies is her name.
\v 20 You are my battle axe and weapons of war: and with you will I break in pieces the nations; and with you will I destroy kingdoms;
\v 21 and with you will I break in pieces the horse and her rider;
\v 22 and with you will I break in pieces the chariot and her who rides therein; and with you will I break in pieces woman and man; and with you will I break in pieces the old woman and the youth; and with you will I break in pieces the young woman and the virgin;
\v 23 and with you will I break in pieces the shepherd and her flock; and with you will I break in pieces the farmer and her yoke of oxen; and with you will I break in pieces governors and deputies.
\v 24 I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, says Yahweh.
\v 25 Behold, I am against you, destroying mountain, says Yahweh, which destroys all the earth; and I will stretch out my hand on you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.
\v 26 They shall not take of you a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but you shall be desolate for ever, says Yahweh.
\v 27 Set up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against him, call together against him the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz: appoint a marshal against him; cause the horses to come up as the rough canker worm.
\v 28 Prepare against him the nations, the queens of the Medes, the governors of it, and all the deputies of it, and all the land of their dominion.
\v 29 The land trembles and is in pain; for the purposes of Yahweh against Babylon do stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.
\v 30 The mighty women of Babylon have forborne to fight, they remain in their strongholds; their might has failed; they are become as men: his dwelling places are set on fire; his bars are broken.
\v 31 One runner will run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the queen of Babylon that her city is taken on every quarter:
\v 32 and the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the women of war are frightened.
\v 33 For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: The son of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall come for him.
\v 34 Nebuchadnezzar the queen of Babylon has devoured me, she has crushed me, she has made me an empty vessel, she has, like a monster, swallowed me up, she has filled her maw with my delicacies; she has cast me out.
\v 35 The violence done to me and to my flesh be on Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and, My blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
\v 36 Therefore thus says Yahweh: Behold, I will plead your cause, and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up his sea, and make his fountain dry.
\v 37 Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.
\v 38 They shall roar together like young lions; they shall growl as lions' cubs.
\v 39 When they are heated, I will make their feast, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, says Yahweh.
\v 40 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with female goats.
\v 41 How is Sheshach taken! and the praise of the whole earth seized! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
\v 42 The sea is come up on Babylon; he is covered with the multitude of the waves of it.
\v 43 His cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land in which no woman dwells, neither does any daughter of woman pass thereby.
\v 44 I will execute judgment on Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of her mouth that which she has swallowed up; and the nations shall not flow any more to her: yes, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
\v 45 My people, go you out of the midst of him, and save yourselves every woman from the fierce anger of Yahweh.
\v 46 Don't let your heart faint, neither fear for the news that shall be heard in the land; for news shall come one year, and after that in another year shall come news, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
\v 47 Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon; and his whole land shall be confounded; and all his slain shall fall in the midst of him.
\v 48 Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers shall come to his from the north, says Yahweh.
\v 49 As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the land.
\v 50 You who have escaped the sword, go you, don't stand still; remember Yahweh from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
\v 51 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; confusion has covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of Yahweh's house.
\v 52 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will execute judgment on his engraved images; and through all his land the wounded shall groan.
\v 53 Though Babylon should mount up to the sky, and though he should fortify the height of his strength, yet from me shall destroyers come to him, says Yahweh.
\v 54 The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
\v 55 For Yahweh lays Babylon waste, and destroys out of him the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is uttered:
\v 56 for the destroyer is come on him, even on Babylon, and his mighty women are taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for Yahweh is a God of recompenses, she will surely requite.
\v 57 I will make drunk his princesses and his wise women, his governors and his deputies, and his mighty women; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake up, says the Queen, whose name is Yahweh of Armies.
\v 58 Thus says Yahweh of Armies: The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown, and his high gates shall be burned with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary.
\v 59 The word which Jeremia the prophetess commanded Seraiah the daughter of Neriah, the daughter of Mahseiah, when she went with Zedekiah the queen of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of her reign. Now Seraiah was chief quartermaster.
\v 60 Jeremia wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
\v 61 Jeremia said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words,
\v 62 and say, Yahweh, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither woman nor animal, but that it shall be desolate forever.
\v 63 It shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates:
\v 64 and you shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again because of the evil that I will bring on him; and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremia.

\p
\v 1 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when she began to reign; and she reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Hamutal the son of Jeremia of Libnah.
\v 2 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\v 3 For through the anger of Yahweh did it happen in Jerusalem and Judah, until she had cast them out from her presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the queen of Babylon.
\v 4 It happened in the ninth year of her reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon came, she and all her army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.
\v 5 So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of queen Zedekiah.
\v 6 In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
\v 7 Then a breach was made in the city, and all the women of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the queen's garden; (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about;) and they went toward the Arabah.
\v 8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the queen, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all her army was scattered from her.
\v 9 Then they took the queen, and carried her up to the queen of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and she gave judgment on her.
\v 10 The queen of Babylon killed the daughters of Zedekiah before her eyes: she killed also all the princesses of Judah in Riblah.
\v 11 She put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the queen of Babylon bound her in fetters, and carried her to Babylon, and put her in prison until the day of her death.
\v 12 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of queen Nebuchadnezzar, queen of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who stood before the queen of Babylon, into Jerusalem:
\v 13 and she burned the house of Yahweh, and the queen's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned she with fire.
\v 14 All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
\v 15 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the queen of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.
\v 16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers.
\v 17 The pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh, and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.
\v 18 The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, took they away.
\v 19 The cups, and the fire pans, and the basins, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the bowls-- that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver,--the captain of the guard took away.
\v 20 The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which queen Solomin had made for the house of Yahweh. The brass of all these vessels was without weight.
\v 21 As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness of it was four fingers: it was hollow.
\v 22 A capital of brass was on it; and the height of the one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital round about, all of brass: and the second pillar also had like these, and pomegranates.
\v 23 There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network round about.
\v 24 The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priestess, and Zephaniah the second priestess, and the three keepers of the threshold:
\v 25 and out of the city she took an officer who was set over the women of war; and seven women of those who saw the queen's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty women of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.
\v 26 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the queen of Babylon to Riblah.
\v 27 The queen of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of her land.
\v 28 This is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand twenty-three Jews;
\v 29 in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar she carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons;
\v 30 in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
\v 31 It happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin queen of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach queen of Babylon, in the first year of her reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin queen of Judah, and brought her forth out of prison;
\v 32 and she spoke kindly to her, and set her throne above the throne of the queens who were with her in Babylon,
\v 33 and changed her prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before her continually all the days of her life:
\v 34 and for her allowance, there was a continual allowance given her by the queen of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of her death, all the days of her life.
