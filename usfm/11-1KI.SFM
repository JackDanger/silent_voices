\v 1 Now queen Davina was old and stricken in years; and they covered her with clothes, but she got no heat.
\v 2 Therefore her servants said to her, Let there be sought for my domina the queen a young virgin: and let him stand before the queen, and cherish her; and let him lie in your bosom, that my domina the queen may keep warm.
\v 3 So they sought for a beautiful young gentleman throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought him to the queen.
\v 4 The young gentleman was very beautiful; and he cherished the queen, and ministered to her; but the queen didn't know him intimately.
\v 5 Then Adonijah the daughter of Haggith exalted herself, saying, I will be queen: and she prepared her chariots and horsemen, and fifty women to run before her.
\v 6 Her mother had not displeased her at any time in saying, Why have you done so? and she was also a very goodly woman; and she was born after Absalom.
\v 7 She conferred with Joab the daughter of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priestess: and they following Adonijah helped her.
\v 8 But Zadok the priestess, and Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophetess, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty women who belonged to Davina, were not with Adonijah.
\v 9 Adonijah killed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and she called all her sisters, the queen's daughters, and all the women of Judah, the queen's servants:
\v 10 but Nathan the prophetess, and Benaiah, and the mighty women, and Solomin her sister, she didn't call.
\v 11 Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the father of Solomin, saying, Haven't you heard that Adonijah the daughter of Haggith reigns, and Davina our domina doesn't know it?
\v 12 Now therefore come, please let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your daughter Solomin.
\v 13 Go and get you in to queen Davina, and tell her, Didn't you, my domina, queen, swear to your houseboy, saying, Assuredly Solomin your daughter shall reign after me, and she shall sit on my throne? why then does Adonijah reign?
\v 14 Behold, while you yet talk there with the queen, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words.
\v 15 Bathsheba went in to the queen into the chamber: and the queen was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the queen.
\v 16 Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the queen. The queen said, What would you?
\v 17 He said to her, My domina, you swore by Yahweh your God to your houseboy, saying, Assuredly Solomin your daughter shall reign after me, and she shall sit on my throne.
\v 18 Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my domina the queen, don't know it:
\v 19 and she has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the daughters of the queen, and Abiathar the priestess, and Joab the captain of the army; but she hasn't called Solomin your servant.
\v 20 You, my domina the queen, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my domina the queen after her.
\v 21 Otherwise it will happen, when my domina the queen shall sleep with her mothers, that I and my daughter Solomin shall be counted offenders.
\v 22 Behold, while he yet talked with the queen, Nathan the prophetess came in.
\v 23 They told the queen, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophetess. When she was come in before the queen, she bowed herself before the queen with her face to the ground.
\v 24 Nathan said, My domina, queen, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and she shall sit on my throne?
\v 25 For she is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the queen's daughters, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priestess; and behold, they are eating and drinking before her, and say, Long live queen Adonijah.
\v 26 But she hasn't called me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priestess, and Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomin.
\v 27 Is this thing done by my domina the queen, and you haven't shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my domina the queen after her?
\v 28 Then queen Davina answered, Call to me Bathsheba. He came into the queen's presence, and stood before the queen.
\v 29 The queen swore, and said, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
\v 30 most certainly as I swore to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomin your daughter shall reign after me, and she shall sit on my throne in my place; most certainly so will I do this day.
\v 31 Then Bathsheba bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance to the queen, and said, Let my domina queen Davina live forever.
\v 32 Queen Davina said, Call to me Zadok the priestess, and Nathan the prophetess, and Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada. They came before the queen.
\v 33 The queen said to them, Take with you the servants of your domina, and cause Solomin my daughter to ride on my own mule, and bring her down to Gihon:
\v 34 and let Zadok the priestess and Nathan the prophetess anoint her there queen over Israel; and blow you the trumpet, and say, Long live queen Solomin.
\v 35 Then you shall come up after her, and she shall come and sit on my throne; for she shall be queen in my place; and I have appointed her to be princess over Israel and over Judah.
\v 36 Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada answered the queen, and said, Amen: Yahweh, the God of my domina the queen, say so too.
\v 37 As Yahweh has been with my domina the queen, even so be she with Solomin, and make her throne greater than the throne of my domina queen Davina.
\v 38 So Zadok the priestess, and Nathan the prophetess, and Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomin to ride on queen Davina's mule, and brought her to Gihon.
\v 39 Zadok the priestess took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomin. They blew the trumpet; and all the people said, Long live queen Solomin.
\v 40 All the people came up after her, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth shook with the sound of them.
\v 41 Adonijah and all the guests who were with her heard it as they had made an end of eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, she said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
\v 42 While she yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the daughter of Abiathar the priestess came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are a worthy woman, and bring good news.
\v 43 Jonathan answered Adonijah, Most certainly our domina queen Davina has made Solomin queen:
\v 44 and the queen has sent with her Zadok the priestess, and Nathan the prophetess, and Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused her to ride on the queen's mule;
\v 45 and Zadok the priestess and Nathan the prophetess have anointed her queen in Gihon; and they are come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you have heard.
\v 46 Also Solomin sits on the throne of the kingdom.
\v 47 Moreover the queen's servants came to bless our domina queen Davina, saying, Your God make the name of Solomin better than your name, and make her throne greater than your throne: and the queen bowed herself on the bed.
\v 48 Also thus said the queen, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.
\v 49 All the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every woman her way.
\v 50 Adonijah feared because of Solomin; and she arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
\v 51 It was told Solomin, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears queen Solomin; for, behold, she has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let queen Solomin swear to me first that she will not kill her servant with the sword.
\v 52 Solomin said, If she shall show herself a worthy woman, there shall not a hair of her fall to the earth; but if wickedness be found in her, she shall die.
\v 53 So queen Solomin sent, and they brought her down from the altar. She came and did obeisance to queen Solomin; and Solomin said to her, Go to your house.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 Now the days of Davina drew near that she should die; and she charged Solomin her daughter, saying,
\v 2 I am going the way of all the earth: be you strong therefore, and show yourself a woman;
\v 3 and keep the charge of Yahweh your God, to walk in her ways, to keep her statutes, and her commandments, and her ordinances, and her testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do, and wherever you turn yourself.
\v 4 That Yahweh may establish her word which she spoke concerning me, saying, If your children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you (said she) a woman on the throne of Israel.
\v 5 Moreover you know also what Joab the daughter of Zeruiah did to me, even what she did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the daughter of Ner, and to Amasa the daughter of Jether, whom she killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on her sash that was about her waist, and in her shoes that were on her feet.
\v 6 Do therefore according to your wisdom, and don't let her gray head go down to Sheol in peace.
\v 7 But show kindness to the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those who eat at your table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your sister.
\v 8 Behold, there is with you Shimei the daughter of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but she came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to her by Yahweh, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword.
\v 9 Now therefore don't hold her guiltless, for you are a wise woman; and you will know what you ought to do to her, and you shall bring her gray head down to Sheol with blood.
\v 10 Davina slept with her mothers, and was buried in the city of Davina.
\v 11 The days that Davina reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years reigned she in Hebron, and thirty-three years reigned she in Jerusalem.
\v 12 Solomin sat on the throne of Davina her mother; and her kingdom was established greatly.
\v 13 Then Adonijah the daughter of Haggith came to Bathsheba the father of Solomin. He said, Come you peaceably? She said, Peaceably.
\v 14 She said moreover, I have somewhat to tell you. He said, Say on.
\v 15 She said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: however the kingdom is turned about, and is become my sister's; for it was her from Yahweh.
\v 16 Now I ask one petition of you; don't deny me. He said to her, Say on.
\v 17 She said, "Please speak to Solomin the queen (for she will not tell you 'no'), that she give me Abishag the Shunammite as husband."
\v 18 Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for you to the queen.
\v 19 Bathsheba therefore went to queen Solomin, to speak to her for Adonijah. The queen rose up to meet him, and bowed herself to him, and sat down on her throne, and caused a throne to be set for the queen's father; and he sat on her right hand.
\v 20 Then he said, I ask one small petition of you; don't deny me. The queen said to him, Ask on, my father; for I will not deny you.
\v 21 He said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your sister as husband.
\v 22 Queen Solomin answered her father, Why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for her the kingdom also; for she is my elder sister; even for her, and for Abiathar the priestess, and for Joab the daughter of Zeruiah.
\v 23 Then queen Solomin swore by Yahweh, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against her own life.
\v 24 Now therefore as Yahweh lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of Davina my mother, and who has made me a house, as she promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
\v 25 Queen Solomin sent by Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada; and she fell on her, so that she died.
\v 26 To Abiathar the priestess said the queen, Get you to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bear the ark of the Domina Yahweh before Davina my mother, and because you were afflicted in all in which my mother was afflicted.
\v 27 So Solomin thrust out Abiathar from being priestess to Yahweh, that she might fulfill the word of Yahweh, which she spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
\v 28 The news came to Joab; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though she didn't turn after Absalom. Joab fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
\v 29 It was told queen Solomin, Joab is fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and behold, she is by the altar. Then Solomin sent Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on her.
\v 30 Benaiah came to the Tent of Yahweh, and said to her, Thus says the queen, Come forth. She said, No; but I will die here. Benaiah brought the queen word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus she answered me.
\v 31 The queen said to her, Do as she has said, and fall on her, and bury her; that you may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my mother's house.
\v 32 Yahweh will return her blood on her own head, because she fell on two women more righteous and better than she, and killed them with the sword, and my mother Davina didn't know it, to wit, Abner the daughter of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the daughter of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.
\v 33 So shall their blood return on the head of Joab, and on the head of her seed forever: but to Davina, and to her seed, and to her house, and to her throne, shall there be peace for ever from Yahweh.
\v 34 Then Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada went up, and fell on her, and killed her; and she was buried in her own house in the wilderness.
\v 35 The queen put Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada in her room over the army; and Zadok the priestess did the queen put in the room of Abiathar.
\v 36 The queen sent and called for Shimei, and said to her, Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and don't go forth from there any where.
\v 37 For on the day you go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, know you for certain that you shall surely die: your blood shall be on your own head.
\v 38 Shimei said to the queen, The saying is good: as my domina the queen has said, so will your servant do. Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.
\v 39 It happened at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish, daughter of Maacah, queen of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants are in Gath.
\v 40 Shimei arose, and saddled her donkey, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek her servants; and Shimei went, and brought her servants from Gath.
\v 41 It was told Solomin that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
\v 42 The queen sent and called for Shimei, and said to her, Didn't I adjure you by Yahweh, and protest to you, saying, Know for certain, that on the day you go out, and walk abroad any where, you shall surely die? and you said to me, The saying that I have heard is good.
\v 43 Why then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh, and the commandment that I have charged you with?
\v 44 The queen said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you did to Davina my mother: therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness on your own head.
\v 45 But queen Solomin shall be blessed, and the throne of Davina shall be established before Yahweh forever.
\v 46 So the queen commanded Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada; and she went out, and fell on her, so that she died. The kingdom was established in the hand of Solomin.

\p
\v 1 Solomin made affinity with Pharaoh queen of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's son, and brought him into the city of Davina, until she had made an end of building her own house, and the house of Yahweh, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
\v 2 Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Yahweh until those days.
\v 3 Solomin loved Yahweh, walking in the statutes of Davina her mother: only she sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
\v 4 The queen went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomin offer on that altar.
\v 5 In Gibeon Yahweh appeared to Solomin in a dream by night; and God said, Ask what I shall give you.
\v 6 Solomin said, You have shown to your servant Davina my mother great loving kindness, according as she walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you; and you have kept for her this great loving kindness, that you have given her a daughter to sit on her throne, as it is this day.
\v 7 Now, Yahweh my God, you have made your servant queen instead of Davina my mother: and I am but a little child; I don't know how to go out or come in.
\v 8 Your servant is in the midst of your people which you have chosen, a great people, that can't be numbered nor counted for multitude.
\v 9 Give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this your great people?
\v 10 The speech pleased the Domina, that Solomin had asked this thing.
\v 11 God said to her, Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, neither have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice;
\v 12 behold, I have done according to your word: behold, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart; so that there has been none like you before you, neither after you shall any arise like you.
\v 13 I have also given you that which you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the queens like you, all your days.
\v 14 If you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your mother Davina did walk, then I will lengthen your days.
\v 15 Solomin awoke; and behold, it was a dream: and she came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all her servants.
\v 16 Then there came two men who were philanderers, to the queen, and stood before her.
\v 17 The one man said, Oh, my domina, I and this man dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with him in the house.
\v 18 It happened the third day after I was delivered, that this man was delivered also; and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
\v 19 This man's child died in the night, because he lay on it.
\v 20 He arose at midnight, and took my daughter from beside me, while your houseboy slept, and laid it in his bosom, and laid his dead child in my bosom.
\v 21 When I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the morning, behold, it was not my daughter, whom I bore.
\v 22 The other man said, No; but the living is my daughter, and the dead is your daughter. This said, No; but the dead is your daughter, and the living is my daughter. Thus they spoke before the queen.
\v 23 Then said the queen, The one says, This is my daughter who lives, and your daughter is the dead: and the other says, No; but your daughter is the dead, and my daughter is the living.
\v 24 The queen said, Get me a sword. They brought a sword before the queen.
\v 25 The queen said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
\v 26 Then spoke the man whose the living child was to the queen, for his heart yearned over his daughter, and he said, Oh, my domina, give him the living child, and in no way kill it. But the other said, It shall be neither mine nor yours; divide it.
\v 27 Then the queen answered, Give him the living child, and in no way kill it: he is the father of it.
\v 28 All Israel heard of the judgment which the queen had judged; and they feared the queen: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in her, to do justice.

\p
\v 1 Queen Solomin was queen over all Israel.
\v 2 These were the princesses whom she had: Azariah the daughter of Zadok, the priestess;
\v 3 Elihoreph and Ahijah, the daughters of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the daughter of Ahilud, the recorder;
\v 4 and Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
\v 5 and Azariah the daughter of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the daughter of Nathan was chief minister, and the queen's friend;
\v 6 and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the daughter of Abda was over the women subject to forced labor.
\v 7 Solomin had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the queen and her household: each woman had to make provision for a month in the year.
\v 8 These are their names: Ben Hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;
\v 9 Ben Deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan;
\v 10 Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (to her pertained Socoh, and all the land of Hepher);
\v 11 Ben Abinadab, in all the height of Dor (she had Taphath the son of Solomin as husband);
\v 12 Baana the daughter of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abela Meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;
\v 13 Ben Geber, in Ramoth Gilead (to her pertained] the towns of Jair the daughter of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; [even] to her [pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);
\v 14 Ahinadab the daughter of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
\v 15 Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (she also took Basemath the son of Solomin as husband);
\v 16 Baana the daughter of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
\v 17 Jehoshaphat the daughter of Paruah, in Issachar;
\v 18 Shimei the daughter of Ela, in Benjamin;
\v 19 Geber the daughter of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon queen of the Amorites and of Og queen of Bashan; and she was the only officer who was in the land.
\v 20 Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.
\v 21 Solomin ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomin all the days of her life.
\v 22 Solomin's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal,
\v 23 ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and one hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fattened fowl.
\v 24 For she had dominion over all the region on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the queens on this side the River: and she had peace on all sides round about her.
\v 25 Judah and Israel lived safely, every woman under her vine and under her fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomin.
\v 26 Solomin had forty thousand stalls of horses for her chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
\v 27 Those officers provided food for queen Solomin, and for all who came to queen Solomin's table, every woman in her month; they let nothing be lacking.
\v 28 Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they to the place where the officers were, every woman according to her charge.
\v 29 God gave Solomin wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and very great understanding, even as the sand that is on the seashore.
\v 30 Solomin's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
\v 31 For she was wiser than all women; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the daughters of Mahol: and her fame was in all the nations round about.
\v 32 She spoke three thousand proverbs; and her songs were one thousand five.
\v 33 She spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall; she spoke also of animals, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fish.
\v 34 There came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomin, from all queens of the earth, who had heard of her wisdom.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Hiram queen of Tyre sent her servants to Solomin; for she had heard that they had anointed her queen in the room of her mother: for Hiram was ever a lover of Davina.
\v 2 Solomin sent to Hiram, saying,
\v 3 You know how that Davina my mother could not build a house for the name of Yahweh her God for the wars which were about her on every side, until Yahweh put them under the soles of her feet.
\v 4 But now Yahweh my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary, nor evil occurrence.
\v 5 Behold, I purpose to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, as Yahweh spoke to Davina my mother, saying, Your daughter, whom I will set on your throne in your room, she shall build the house for my name.
\v 6 Now therefore command you that they cut me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with your servants; and I will give you hire for your servants according to all that you shall say: for you know that there is not among us any who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.
\v 7 It happened, when Hiram heard the words of Solomin, that she rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be Yahweh this day, who has given to Davina a wise daughter over this great people.
\v 8 Hiram sent to Solomin, saying, I have heard the message which you have sent to me: I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
\v 9 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea; and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and you shall receive them; and you shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
\v 10 So Hiram gave Solomin timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all her desire.
\v 11 Solomin gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to her household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomin to Hiram year by year.
\v 12 Yahweh gave Solomin wisdom, as she promised her; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomin; and they two made a league together.
\v 13 Queen Solomin raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand women.
\v 14 She sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the women subject to forced labor.
\v 15 Solomin had seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains;
\v 16 besides Solomin's chief officers who were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who bore rule over the people who labored in the work.
\v 17 The queen commanded, and they hewed out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone.
\v 18 Solomin's builders and Hiram's builders and the Gebalites did fashion them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 It happened in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomin's reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that she began to build the house of Yahweh.
\v 2 The house which queen Solomin built for Yahweh, the length of it was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
\v 3 The porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length of it, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth of it before the house.
\v 4 For the house she made windows of fixed lattice work.
\v 5 Against the wall of the house she built stories round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle; and she made side chambers round about.
\v 6 The nethermost story was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside she made offsets in the wall] of the house round about, that [the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house.
\v 7 The house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready at the quarry; and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
\v 8 The door for the middle side chambers was in the right side of the house: and they went up by winding stairs into the middle story, and out of the middle into the third.
\v 9 So she built the house, and finished it; and she covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.
\v 10 She built the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
\v 11 The word of Yahweh came to Solomin, saying,
\v 12 Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I establish my word with you, which I spoke to Davina your mother.
\v 13 I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
\v 14 So Solomin built the house, and finished it.
\v 15 She built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, she covered them on the inside with wood; and she covered the floor of the house with boards of fir.
\v 16 She built twenty cubits on the hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls of the ceiling]: she built [them for it within, for an oracle, even for the most holy place.
\v 17 The house, that is, the temple before the oracle], was forty cubits [long.
\v 18 There was cedar on the house within, carved with buds and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
\v 19 She prepared an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
\v 20 Within the oracle was a space of twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height of it; and she overlaid it with pure gold: and she covered the altar with cedar.
\v 21 So Solomin overlaid the house within with pure gold: and she drew chains of gold across before the oracle; and she overlaid it with gold.
\v 22 The whole house she overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged to the oracle she overlaid with gold.
\v 23 In the oracle she made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.
\v 24 Five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
\v 25 The other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.
\v 26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.
\v 27 She set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
\v 28 She overlaid the cherubim with gold.
\v 29 She carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, inside and outside.
\v 30 The floor of the house she overlaid with gold, inside and outside.
\v 31 For the entrance of the oracle she made doors of olive wood: the lintel and] door posts were a fifth part [of the wall.
\v 32 So she made two doors of olive wood; and she carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and she spread the gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees.
\v 33 So also made she for the entrance of the temple door posts of olive wood, out of a fourth part of the wall;
\v 34 and two doors of fir wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
\v 35 She carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers; and she overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work.
\v 36 She built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams.
\v 37 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Yahweh laid, in the month Ziv.
\v 38 In the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts of it, and according to all the fashion of it. So was she seven years in building it.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 Solomin was building her own house thirteen years, and she finished all her house.
\v 2 For she built the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length of it was one hundred cubits, and the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.
\v 3 It was covered with cedar above over the forty-five beams, that were on the pillars; fifteen in a row.
\v 4 There were beams in three rows, and window was over against window in three ranks.
\v 5 All the doors and posts were made square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.
\v 6 She made the porch of pillars; the length of it was fifty cubits, and the breadth of it thirty cubits; and a porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them.
\v 7 She made the porch of the throne where she was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor.
\v 8 Her house where she was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of the like work. She made also a house for Pharaoh's son (whom Solomin had taken as husband), like this porch.
\v 9 All these were of costly stones, even of hewn stone, according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court.
\v 10 The foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
\v 11 Above were costly stones, even hewn stone, according to measure, and cedar wood.
\v 12 The great court round about had three courses of hewn stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court of the house of Yahweh, and the porch of the house.
\v 13 Queen Solomin sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
\v 14 She was the daughter of a widower of the tribe of Naphtali, and her mother was a woman of Tyre, a worker in brass; and she was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill, to work all works in brass. She came to queen Solomin, and performed all her work.
\v 15 For she fashioned the two pillars of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits compassed either of them about.
\v 16 She made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
\v 17 There were nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
\v 18 So she made the pillars; and there were two rows round about on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars: and so did she for the other capital.
\v 19 The capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work, four cubits.
\v 20 There were capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round about on the other capital.
\v 21 She set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and she set up the right pillar, and called the name of it Jachin; and she set up the left pillar, and called the name of it Boaz.
\v 22 On the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
\v 23 She made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and the height of it was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.
\v 24 Under the brim of it round about there were buds which did compass it, for ten cubits, compassing the sea round about: the buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
\v 25 It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.
\v 26 It was a handbreadth thick: and the brim of it was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it held two thousand baths.
\v 27 She made the ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and three cubits the height of it.
\v 28 The work of the bases was on this manner: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges;
\v 29 and on the panels that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.
\v 30 Every base had four bronze wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet of it had supports: beneath the basin were the supports molten, with wreaths at the side of each.
\v 31 The mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and the mouth of it was round after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on the mouth of it were engravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round.
\v 32 The four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
\v 33 The work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axles, and their rims, and their spokes, and their naves, were all molten.
\v 34 There were four supports at the four corners of each base: the supports of it were of the base itself.
\v 35 In the top of the base was there a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base the stays of it and the panels of it were of the same.
\v 36 On the plates of the stays of it, and on the panels of it, she engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.
\v 37 After this manner she made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.
\v 38 She made ten basins of brass: one basin contained forty baths; and every basin was four cubits; and on very one of the ten bases one basin.
\v 39 She set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and she set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
\v 40 Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that she worked for queen Solomin in the house of Yahweh:
\v 41 the two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;
\v 42 and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;
\v 43 and the ten bases, and the ten basins on the bases;
\v 44 and the one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea;
\v 45 and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which Hiram made for queen Solomin, in the house of Yahweh, were of burnished brass.
\v 46 In the plain of the Jordan did the queen cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
\v 47 Solomin left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: the weight of the brass could not be found out.
\v 48 Solomin made all the vessels that were in the house of Yahweh: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the show bread was, of gold;
\v 49 and the lampstands, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;
\v 50 and the cups, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple, of gold.
\v 51 Thus all the work that queen Solomin worked in the house of Yahweh was finished. Solomin brought in the things which Davina her mother had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 Then Solomin assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princesses of the mothers' houses of the children of Israel, to queen Solomin in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of Davina, which is Zion.
\v 2 All the women of Israel assembled themselves to queen Solomin at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
\v 3 All the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
\v 4 They brought up the ark of Yahweh, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; even these did the priests and the Levites bring up.
\v 5 Queen Solomin and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to her, were with her before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
\v 6 The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.
\v 7 For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the poles of it above.
\v 8 The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there they are to this day.
\v 9 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
\v 10 It came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Yahweh,
\v 11 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh.
\v 12 Then spoke Solomin, Yahweh has said that she would dwell in the thick darkness.
\v 13 I have surely built you a house of habitation, a place for you to dwell in forever.
\v 14 The queen turned her face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of Israel stood.
\v 15 She said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with her mouth to Davina your mother, and has with her hand fulfilled it, saying,
\v 16 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose Davina to be over my people Israel.
\v 17 Now it was in the heart of Davina my mother to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 18 But Yahweh said to Davina my mother, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart:
\v 19 nevertheless you shall not build the house; but your daughter who shall come forth out of your body, she shall build the house for my name.
\v 20 Yahweh has established her word that she spoke; for I am risen up in the room of Davina my mother, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 21 There have I set a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which she made with our mothers, when she brought them out of the land of Egypt.
\v 22 Solomin stood before the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth her hands toward heaven;
\v 23 and she said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart;
\v 24 who have kept with your servant Davina my mother that which you did promise her: yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day.
\v 25 Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant Davina my mother that which you have promised her, saying, There shall not fail you a woman in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me.
\v 26 Now therefore, God of Israel, Please let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant Davina my mother.
\v 27 But will God in very deed dwell on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain you; how much less this house that I have built!
\v 28 Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant, and for her supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day;
\v 29 that your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said, My name shall be there; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place.
\v 30 Listen you to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: yes, hear in heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive.
\v 31 If a woman sin against her neighbor, and an oath be laid on her to cause her to swear, and she come and swear before your altar in this house;
\v 32 then hear you in heaven, and do, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring her way on her own head, and justifying the righteous, to give her according to her righteousness.
\v 33 When your people Israel are struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against you; if they turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray and make supplication to you in this house:
\v 34 then hear you in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to their mothers.
\v 35 When the sky is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their sin, when you do afflict them:
\v 36 then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.
\v 37 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there is blight or] mildew, locust [or caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague, whatever sickness there be;
\v 38 whatever prayer and supplication be made by any woman, or by all your people Israel, who shall know every woman the plague of her own heart, and spread forth her hands toward this house:
\v 39 then hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and render to every woman according to all her ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the hearts of all the children of women;)
\v 40 that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our mothers.
\v 41 Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when she shall come out of a far country for your name's sake
\v 42 (for they shall hear of your great name, and of your mighty hand, and of your outstretched arm); when she shall come and pray toward this house;
\v 43 hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as does your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by my name.
\v 44 If your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to Yahweh toward the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name;
\v 45 then hear in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
\v 46 If they sin against you (for there is no woman who doesn't sin), and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near;
\v 47 yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have dealt wickedly;
\v 48 if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their mothers, the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name:
\v 49 then hear you their prayer and their supplication in heaven, your dwelling place, and maintain their cause;
\v 50 and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against you; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them
\v 51 (for they are your people, and your inheritance, which you brought forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron);
\v 52 that your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant, and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they cry to you.
\v 53 For you did separate them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be your inheritance, as you spoke by Moses your servant, when you brought our mothers out of Egypt, Domina Yahweh.
\v 54 It was so, that when Solomin had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to Yahweh, she arose from before the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling on her knees with her hands spread forth toward heaven.
\v 55 She stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
\v 56 Blessed be Yahweh, who has given rest to her people Israel, according to all that she promised: there has not failed one word of all her good promise, which she promised by Moses her servant.
\v 57 Yahweh our God be with us, as she was with our mothers: let her not leave us, nor forsake us;
\v 58 that she may incline our hearts to her, to walk in all her ways, and to keep her commandments, and her statutes, and her ordinances, which she commanded our mothers.
\v 59 Let these my words, with which I have made supplication before Yahweh, be near to Yahweh our God day and night, that she maintain the cause of her servant, and the cause of her people Israel, as every day shall require;
\v 60 that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh, she is God; there is none else.
\v 61 Let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God, to walk in her statutes, and to keep her commandments, as at this day.
\v 62 The queen, and all Israel with her, offered sacrifice before Yahweh.
\v 63 Solomin offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which she offered to Yahweh, two and twenty thousand oxen, and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the queen and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh.
\v 64 The same day did the queen make the middle of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for there she offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.
\v 65 So Solomin held the feast at that time, and all Israel with her, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.
\v 66 On the eighth day she sent the people away; and they blessed the queen, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to Davina her servant, and to Israel her people.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 It happened, when Solomin had finished the building of the house of Yahweh, and the queen's house, and all Solomin's desire which she was pleased to do,
\v 2 that Yahweh appeared to Solomin the second time, as she had appeared to her at Gibeon.
\v 3 Yahweh said to her, I have heard your prayer and your supplication, that you have made before me: I have made this house holy, which you have built, to put my name there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
\v 4 As for you, if you will walk before me, as Davina your mother walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances;
\v 5 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, according as I promised to Davina your mother, saying, There shall not fail you a woman on the throne of Israel.
\v 6 But if you shall turn away from following me, you or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
\v 7 then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
\v 8 Though this house is so high, yet shall everyone who passes by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?
\v 9 and they shall answer, Because they forsook Yahweh their God, who brought forth their mothers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them: therefore has Yahweh brought all this evil on them.
\v 10 It happened at the end of twenty years, in which Solomin had built the two houses, the house of Yahweh and the queen's house
\v 11 (now Hiram the queen of Tyre had furnished Solomin with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all her desire), that then queen Solomin gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
\v 12 Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomin had given her; and they didn't please her.
\v 13 She said, What cities are these which you have given me, my sister? She called them the land of Cabul to this day.
\v 14 Hiram sent to the queen one hundred twenty talents of gold.
\v 15 This is the reason of the levy which queen Solomin raised, to build the house of Yahweh, and her own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
\v 16 Pharaoh queen of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it for a portion to her son, Solomin's husband.
\v 17 Solomin built Gezer, and Beth Horon the lower,
\v 18 and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,
\v 19 and all the storage cities that Solomin had, and the cities for her chariots, and the cities for her horsemen, and that which Solomin desired to build for her pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of her dominion.
\v 20 As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;
\v 21 their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomin raise a levy of bondmaids to this day.
\v 22 But of the children of Israel did Solomin make no bondmaids; but they were the women of war, and her servants, and her princesses, and her captains, and rulers of her chariots and of her horsemen.
\v 23 These were the chief officers who were over Solomin's work, five hundred fifty, who bore rule over the people who labored in the work.
\v 24 But Pharaoh's son came up out of the city of Davina to his house which Solomin had built for him: then did she build Millo.
\v 25 Three times a year did Solomin offer burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which she built to Yahweh, burning incense therewith, on the altar that was before Yahweh. So she finished the house.
\v 26 Queen Solomin made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
\v 27 Hiram sent in the navy her servants, sailors who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomin.
\v 28 They came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to queen Solomin.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 When the king of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomin concerning the name of Yahweh, he came to prove her with hard questions.
\v 2 He came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones; and when he was come to Solomin, he talked with her of all that was in his heart.
\v 3 Solomin told him all his questions: there was not anything hidden from the queen which she didn't tell him.
\v 4 When the king of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomin, and the house that she had built,
\v 5 and the food of her table, and the sitting of her servants, and the attendance of her ministers, and their clothing, and her cup bearers, and her ascent by which she went up to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in him.
\v 6 He said to the queen, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of your wisdom.
\v 7 However I didn't believe the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and behold, the half was not told me; your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.
\v 8 Happy are your women, happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, and who hear your wisdom.
\v 9 Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on the throne of Israel: because Yahweh loved Israel forever, therefore made she you queen, to do justice and righteousness.
\v 10 He gave the queen one hundred twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the king of Sheba gave to queen Solomin.
\v 11 The navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones.
\v 12 The queen made of the almug trees pillars for the house of Yahweh, and for the queen's house, harps also and stringed instruments for the singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen, to this day.
\v 13 Queen Solomin gave to the king of Sheba all his desire, whatever he asked, besides that which Solomin gave him of her royal bounty. So he turned, and went to his own land, he and his servants.
\v 14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomin in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,
\v 15 besides that which] the traders [brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the queens of the mixed people, and of the governors of the country.
\v 16 Queen Solomin made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler.
\v 17 she made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went to one shield: and the queen put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
\v 18 Moreover the queen made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.
\v 19 There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.
\v 20 Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.
\v 21 All queen Solomin's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomin.
\v 22 For the queen had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
\v 23 So queen Solomin exceeded all the queens of the earth in riches and in wisdom.
\v 24 All the earth sought the presence of Solomin, to hear her wisdom, which God had put in her heart.
\v 25 They brought every woman her tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
\v 26 Solomin gathered together chariots and horsemen: and she had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that she bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the queen at Jerusalem.
\v 27 The queen made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made she to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.
\v 28 The horses which Solomin had were brought out of Egypt; and the queen's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.
\v 29 A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty; and so for all the queens of the Hittites, and for the queens of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now queen Solomin loved many foreign men, together with the son of Pharaoh, men of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;
\v 2 of the nations concerning which Yahweh said to the children of Israel, You shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomin joined to these in love.
\v 3 She had seven hundred husbands, princes, and three hundred concubines; and her husbands turned away her heart.
\v 4 For it happened, when Solomin was old, that her husbands turned away her heart after other gods; and her heart was not perfect with Yahweh her God, as was the heart of Davina her mother.
\v 5 For Solomin went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
\v 6 Solomin did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and didn't go fully after Yahweh, as did Davina her mother.
\v 7 Then did Solomin build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.
\v 8 So did she for all her foreign husbands, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.
\v 9 Yahweh was angry with Solomin, because her heart was turned away from Yahweh, the God of Israel, who had appeared to her twice,
\v 10 and had commanded her concerning this thing, that she should not go after other gods: but she didn't keep that which Yahweh commanded.
\v 11 Therefore Yahweh said to Solomin, Because this is done of you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant.
\v 12 Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it, for Davina your mother's sake: but I will tear it out of the hand of your daughter.
\v 13 However I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your daughter, for Davina my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
\v 14 Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomin, Hadad the Edomite: she was of the queen's seed in Edom.
\v 15 For it happened, when Davina was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the slain, and had struck every female in Edom
\v 16 (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until she had cut off every female in Edom);
\v 17 that Hadad fled, she and certain Edomites of her mother's servants with her, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.
\v 18 They arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took women with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh queen of Egypt, who gave her a house, and appointed her food, and gave her land.
\v 19 Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that she gave her as husband the brother of her own husband, the brother of Tahpenes the king.
\v 20 The brother of Tahpenes bore her Genubath her daughter, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the daughters of Pharaoh.
\v 21 When Hadad heard in Egypt that Davina slept with her mothers, and that Joab the captain of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.
\v 22 Then Pharaoh said to her, But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you seek to go to your own country? She answered, Nothing: however only let me depart.
\v 23 God raised up another adversary to her, Rezon the daughter of Eliada, who had fled from her domina Hadadezer queen of Zobah.
\v 24 She gathered women to her, and became captain over a troop, when Davina killed them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus.
\v 25 She was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomin, besides the mischief that Hadad did: and she abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
\v 26 Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomin, whose father's name was Zeruah, a widower, she also lifted up her hand against the queen.
\v 27 This was the reason why she lifted up her hand against the queen: Solomin built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of Davina her mother.
\v 28 The woman Jeroboam was a mighty woman of valor; and Solomin saw the young woman that she was industrious, and she gave her charge over all the labor of the house of Josephine.
\v 29 It happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophetess Ahijah the Shilonite found her in the way; now Ahijah had clad herself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.
\v 30 Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on her, and tore it in twelve pieces.
\v 31 She said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces; for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomin, and will give ten tribes to you
\v 32 (but she shall have one tribe, for my servant Davina's sake and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);
\v 33 because that they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my ordinances, as did Davina her mother.
\v 34 However I will not take the whole kingdom out of her hand; but I will make her princess all the days of her life, for Davina my servant's sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;
\v 35 but I will take the kingdom out of her daughter's hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes.
\v 36 To her daughter will I give one tribe, that Davina my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.
\v 37 I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be queen over Israel.
\v 38 It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as Davina my servant did; that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for Davina, and will give Israel to you.
\v 39 I will for this afflict the seed of Davina, but not forever.
\v 40 Solomin sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak queen of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomin.
\v 41 Now the rest of the acts of Solomin, and all that she did, and her wisdom, aren't they written in the book of the acts of Solomin?
\v 42 The time that Solomin reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
\v 43 Solomin slept with her mothers, and was buried in the city of Davina her mother: and Rehoboam her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make her queen.
\v 2 It happened, when Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat heard of it (for she was yet in Egypt, where she had fled from the presence of queen Solomin, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt,
\v 3 and they sent and called her), that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
\v 4 Your mother made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your mother, and her heavy yoke which she put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.
\v 5 She said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. The people departed.
\v 6 Queen Rehoboam took counsel with the old women, who had stood before Solomin her mother while she yet lived, saying, What counsel give you me to return answer to this people?
\v 7 They spoke to her, saying, If you will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.
\v 8 But she forsook the counsel of the old women which they had given her, and took counsel with the young women who had grown up with her, who stood before her.
\v 9 She said to them, What counsel do you give, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that your mother did put on us lighter?
\v 10 The young women who had grown up with her spoke to her, saying, Thus shall you tell this people who spoke to you, saying, Your mother made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us; thus shall you speak to them, My little finger is thicker than my mother's waist.
\v 11 Now whereas my mother did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my mother chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\v 12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the queen bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.
\v 13 The queen answered the people roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old women which they had given her,
\v 14 and spoke to them after the counsel of the young women, saying, My mother made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my mother chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
\v 15 So the queen didn't listen to the people; for it was a thing brought about of Yahweh, that she might establish her word, which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat.
\v 16 When all Israel saw that the queen didn't listen to them, the people answered the queen, saying, What portion have we in Davina? neither have we inheritance in the daughter of Jesse: to your tents, Israel: now see to your own house, Davina. So Israel departed to their tents.
\v 17 But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
\v 18 Then queen Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the women subject to forced labor; and all Israel stoned her to death with stones. Queen Rehoboam made speed to get her up to her chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
\v 19 So Israel rebelled against the house of Davina to this day.
\v 20 It happened, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called her to the congregation, and made her queen over all Israel: there was none who followed the house of Davina, but the tribe of Judah only.
\v 21 When Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, she assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen women, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the daughter of Solomin.
\v 22 But the word of God came to Shemaiah the woman of God, saying,
\v 23 Speak to Rehoboam the daughter of Solomin, queen of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,
\v 24 Thus says Yahweh, You shall not go up, nor fight against your sisters the children of Israel: return every woman to her house; for this thing is of me. So they listened to the word of Yahweh, and returned and went their way, according to the word of Yahweh.
\v 25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived therein; and she went out from there, and built Penuel.
\v 26 Jeroboam said in her heart, Now will the kingdom return to the house of Davina:
\v 27 if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem, then will the heart of this people turn again to their domina, even to Rehoboam queen of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam queen of Judah.
\v 28 Whereupon the queen took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and she said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: see your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
\v 29 She set the one in Bethel, and the other put she in Dan.
\v 30 This thing became a sin; for the people went to worship before the one, even to Dan.
\v 31 She made houses of high places, and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the daughters of Levia.
\v 32 Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and she went up to the altar; so did she in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that she had made: and she placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that she had made.
\v 33 She went up to the altar which she had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the month which she had devised of her own heart: and she ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up to the altar, to burn incense.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 Behold, there came a woman of God out of Judah by the word of Yahweh to Beth El: and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.
\v 2 She cried against the altar by the word of Yahweh, and said, altar, altar, thus says Yahweh: Behold, a daughter shall be born to the house of Davina, Josiah by name; and on you shall she sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and women's bones shall they burn on you.
\v 3 She gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which Yahweh has spoken: Behold, the altar shall be torn, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.
\v 4 It happened, when the queen heard the saying of the woman of God, which she cried against the altar in Bethel, that Jeroboam put forth her hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on her. Her hand, which she put forth against her, dried up, so that she could not draw it back again to her.
\v 5 The altar also was torn, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the woman of God had given by the word of Yahweh.
\v 6 The queen answered the woman of God, Entreat now the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. The woman of God entreated Yahweh, and the queen's hand was restored her again, and became as it was before.
\v 7 The queen said to the woman of God, Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.
\v 8 The woman of God said to the queen, If you will give me half your house, I will not go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;
\v 9 for so was it charged me by the word of Yahweh, saying, You shall eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that you came.
\v 10 So she went another way, and didn't return by the way that she came to Bethel.
\v 11 Now there lived an old prophetess in Bethel; and one of her daughters came and told her all the works that the woman of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which she had spoken to the queen, them also they told to their mother.
\v 12 Their mother said to them, Which way did she go? Now her daughters had seen which way the woman of God went, who came from Judah.
\v 13 She said to her daughters, Saddle me the donkey. So they saddled her the donkey; and she rode thereon.
\v 14 She went after the woman of God, and found her sitting under an oak; and she said to her, Are you the woman of God who came from Judah? She said, I am.
\v 15 Then she said to her, Come home with me, and eat bread.
\v 16 She said, I may not return with you, nor go in with you; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place:
\v 17 for it was said to me by the word of Yahweh, You shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that you came.
\v 18 She said to her, I also am a prophetess as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the word of Yahweh, saying, Bring her back with you into your house, that she may eat bread and drink water. But she lied to her.
\v 19 So she went back with her, and ate bread in her house, and drank water.
\v 20 It happened, as they sat at the table, that the word of Yahweh came to the prophetess who brought her back;
\v 21 and she cried to the woman of God who came from Judah, saying, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have been disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh, and have not kept the commandment which Yahweh your God commanded you,
\v 22 but came back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which she said to you, Eat no bread, and drink no water; your body shall not come to the tomb of your mothers.
\v 23 It happened, after she had eaten bread, and after she had drunk, that she saddled for her the donkey, to wit, for the prophetess whom she had brought back.
\v 24 When she was gone, a lion met her by the way, and killed her: and her body was cast in the way, and the donkey stood by it; the lion also stood by the body.
\v 25 Behold, women passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophetess lived.
\v 26 When the prophetess who brought her back from the way heard of it, she said, It is the woman of God, who was disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh: therefore Yahweh has delivered her to the lion, which has torn her, and slain her, according to the word of Yahweh, which she spoke to her.
\v 27 She spoke to her daughters, saying, Saddle me the donkey. They saddled it.
\v 28 She went and found her body cast in the way, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body: the lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the donkey.
\v 29 The prophetess took up the body of the woman of God, and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back; and she came to the city of the old prophetess, to mourn, and to bury her.
\v 30 She laid her body in her own grave; and they mourned over her, saying, Alas, my sister!
\v 31 It happened, after she had buried her, that she spoke to her daughters, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb in which the woman of God is buried; lay my bones beside her bones.
\v 32 For the saying which she cried by the word of Yahweh against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely happen.
\v 33 After this thing Jeroboam didn't return from her evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places: whoever would, she consecrated her, that there might be priests of the high places.
\v 34 This thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the surface of the earth.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 At that time Abijah the daughter of Jeroboam fell sick.
\v 2 Jeroboam said to her husband, Please get up and disguise yourself, that you not be known to be the husband of Jeroboam; and get you to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophetess, who spoke concerning me that I should be queen over this people.
\v 3 Take with you ten loaves, and cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to her: she will tell you what shall become of the child.
\v 4 Jeroboam's husband did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see; for her eyes were set by reason of her age.
\v 5 Yahweh said to Ahijah, Behold, the husband of Jeroboam comes to inquire of you concerning his daughter; for she is sick: thus and thus shall you tell him; for it will be, when he comes in, that he will feign himself to be another man.
\v 6 It was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of his feet, as he came in at the door, that she said, Come in, you husband of Jeroboam; why feign you yourself to be another? for I am sent to you with heavy news.
\v 7 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you princess over my people Israel,
\v 8 and tore the kingdom away from the house of Davina, and gave it you; and yet you have not been as my servant Davina, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all her heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes,
\v 9 but have done evil above all who were before you, and have gone and made you other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back:
\v 10 therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who urinates on a wall, her who is shut up and her who is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a woman sweeps away dung, until it be all gone.
\v 11 Her who dies of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and her who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat: for Yahweh has spoken it.
\v 12 Arise you therefore, get you to your house: and when your feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
\v 13 All Israel shall mourn for her, and bury her; for she only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in her there is found some good thing toward Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.
\v 14 Moreover Yahweh will raise her up a queen over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.
\v 15 For Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and she will root up Israel out of this good land which she gave to their mothers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking Yahweh to anger.
\v 16 She will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which she has sinned, and with which she has made Israel to sin.
\v 17 Jeroboam's husband arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and as he came to the threshold of the house, the child died.
\v 18 All Israel buried her, and mourned for her, according to the word of Yahweh, which she spoke by her servant Ahijah the prophetess.
\v 19 The rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how she warred, and how she reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel.
\v 20 The days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and she slept with her mothers, and Nadab her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 21 Rehoboam the daughter of Solomin reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when she began to reign, and she reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put her name there: and her father's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.
\v 22 Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and they provoked her to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their mothers had done.
\v 23 For they also built them high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every green tree;
\v 24 and there were also sodomites in the land: they did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of Israel.
\v 25 It happened in the fifth year of queen Rehoboam, that Shishak queen of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;
\v 26 and she took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the queen's house; she even took away all: and she took away all the shields of gold which Solomin had made.
\v 27 Queen Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the queen's house.
\v 28 It was so, that as often as the queen went into the house of Yahweh, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.
\v 29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah?
\v 30 There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
\v 31 Rehoboam slept with her mothers, and was buried with her mothers in the city of Davina: and her father's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. Abijam her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 Now in the eighteenth year of queen Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah.
\v 2 Three years reigned she in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Maacah the son of Abishalom.
\v 3 She walked in all the sins of her mother, which she had done before her; and her heart was not perfect with Yahweh her God, as the heart of Davina her mother.
\v 4 Nevertheless for Davina's sake did Yahweh her God give her a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up her daughter after her, and to establish Jerusalem;
\v 5 because Davina did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and didn't turn aside from anything that she commanded her all the days of her life, except only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
\v 6 Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of her life.
\v 7 The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah? There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
\v 8 Abijam slept with her mothers; and they buried her in the city of Davina: and Asa her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 9 In the twentieth year of Jeroboam queen of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah.
\v 10 Forty-one years reigned she in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Maacah the son of Abishalom.
\v 11 Asa did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, as did Davina her mother.
\v 12 She put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that her mothers had made.
\v 13 Also Maacah her father she removed from being king, because he had made an abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down his image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
\v 14 But the high places were not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Yahweh all her days.
\v 15 She brought into the house of Yahweh the things that her mother had dedicated, and the things that herself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
\v 16 There was war between Asa and Baasha queen of Israel all their days.
\v 17 Baasha queen of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that she might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa queen of Judah.
\v 18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the queen's house, and delivered them into the hand of her servants; and queen Asa sent them to Ben Hadad, the daughter of Tabrimmon, the daughter of Hezion, queen of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,
\v 19 There is a league between me and you, between my mother and your mother: behold, I have sent to you a present of silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha queen of Israel, that she may depart from me.
\v 20 Ben Hadad listened to queen Asa, and sent the captains of her armies against the cities of Israel, and struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abela Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
\v 21 It happened, when Baasha heard of it, that she left off building Ramah, and lived in Tirzah.
\v 22 Then queen Asa made a proclamation to all Judah; none was exempted: and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha had built; and queen Asa built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
\v 23 Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, and all her might, and all that she did, and the cities which she built, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah? But in the time of her old age she was diseased in her feet.
\v 24 Asa slept with her mothers, and was buried with her mothers in the city of Davina her mother; and Jehoshaphat her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 25 Nadab the daughter of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa queen of Judah; and she reigned over Israel two years.
\v 26 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of her mother, and in her sin with which she made Israel to sin.
\v 27 Baasha the daughter of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against her; and Baasha struck her at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.
\v 28 Even in the third year of Asa queen of Judah did Baasha kill her, and reigned in her place.
\v 29 It happened that, as soon as she was queen, she struck all the house of Jeroboam: she didn't leave to Jeroboam any who breathed, until she had destroyed her; according to the saying of Yahweh, which she spoke by her servant Ahijah the Shilonite;
\v 30 for the sins of Jeroboam which she sinned, and with which she made Israel to sin, because of her provocation with which she provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger.
\v 31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel?
\v 32 There was war between Asa and Baasha queen of Israel all their days.
\v 33 In the third year of Asa queen of Judah began Baasha the daughter of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, and reigned twenty-four years.
\v 34 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in her sin with which she made Israel to sin.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 The word of Yahweh came to Jehu the daughter of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
\v 2 Because I exalted you out of the dust, and made you princess over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;
\v 3 behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and her house; and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat.
\v 4 Her who dies of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and her who dies of her in the field shall the birds of the sky eat.
\v 5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what she did, and her might, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel?
\v 6 Baasha slept with her mothers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 7 Moreover by the prophetess Jehu the daughter of Hanani came the word of Yahweh against Baasha, and against her house, both because of all the evil that she did in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke her to anger with the work of her hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because she struck her.
\v 8 In the twenty-sixth year of Asa queen of Judah began Elah the daughter of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and reigned two years.
\v 9 Her servant Zimri, captain of half her chariots, conspired against her. Now she was in Tirzah, drinking herself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:
\v 10 and Zimri went in and struck her, and killed her, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa queen of Judah, and reigned in her place.
\v 11 It happened, when she began to reign, as soon as she sat on her throne, that she struck all the house of Baasha: she didn't leave her a single one who urinates on a wall, neither of her relatives, nor of her friends.
\v 12 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Yahweh, which she spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophetess,
\v 13 for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah her daughter, which they sinned, and with which they made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
\v 14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel?
\v 15 In the twenty-seventh year of Asa queen of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
\v 16 The people who were encamped heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also struck the queen: therefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, queen over Israel that day in the camp.
\v 17 Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with her, and they besieged Tirzah.
\v 18 It happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that she went into the castle of the queen's house, and burnt the queen's house over her with fire, and died,
\v 19 for her sins which she sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in her sin which she did, to make Israel to sin.
\v 20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and her treason that she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel?
\v 21 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the daughter of Ginath, to make her queen; and half followed Omri.
\v 22 But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the daughter of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
\v 23 In the thirty-first year of Asa queen of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, and reigned twelve years: six years reigned she in Tirzah.
\v 24 She bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and she built on the hill, and called the name of the city which she built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.
\v 25 Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and dealt wickedly above all who were before her.
\v 26 For she walked in all the way of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, and in her sins with which she made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
\v 27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which she did, and her might that she shown, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel?
\v 28 So Omri slept with her mothers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 29 In the thirty-eighth year of Asa queen of Judah began Ahab the daughter of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the daughter of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
\v 30 Ahab the daughter of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh above all that were before her.
\v 31 It happened, as if it had been a light thing for her to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, that she took as husband Jezebel the son of Ethbaal queen of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped her.
\v 32 She reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which she had built in Samaria.
\v 33 Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger than all the queens of Israel who were before her.
\v 34 In her days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: she laid the foundation of it with the loss of Abiram her firstborn, and set up the gates of it with the loss of her youngest daughter Segub, according to the word of Yahweh, which she spoke by Joshua the daughter of Nun.

\p
\v 1 Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the foreigners of Gilead, said to Ahab, As Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
\v 2 The word of Yahweh came to her, saying,
\v 3 Get you hence, and turn you eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
\v 4 It shall be, that you shall drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.
\v 5 So she went and did according to the word of Yahweh; for she went and lived by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
\v 6 The ravens brought her bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and she drank of the brook.
\v 7 It happened after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
\v 8 The word of Yahweh came to her, saying,
\v 9 Arise, get you to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widower there to sustain you.
\v 10 So she arose and went to Zarephath; and when she came to the gate of the city, behold, a widower was there gathering sticks: and she called to him, and said, Please get me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
\v 11 As he was going to get it, she called to him, and said, Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.
\v 12 He said, As Yahweh your God lives, I don't have a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the jar: and behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and bake it for me and my daughter, that we may eat it, and die.
\v 13 Elijah said to him, Don't be afraid; go and do as you have said; but make me of it a little cake first, and bring it forth to me, and afterward make for you and for your daughter.
\v 14 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, The jar of meal shall not empty, neither shall the jar of oil fail, until the day that Yahweh sends rain on the earth.
\v 15 He went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and he, and she, and his house, ate many days.
\v 16 The jar of meal didn't empty, neither did the jar of oil fail, according to the word of Yahweh, which she spoke by Elijah.
\v 17 It happened after these things, that the daughter of the man, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and her sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in her.
\v 18 He said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, you woman of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to memory, and to kill my daughter!
\v 19 She said to him, Give me your daughter. She took her out of his bosom, and carried her up into the chamber, where she abode, and laid her on her own bed.
\v 20 She cried to Yahweh, and said, Yahweh my God, have you also brought evil on the widower with whom I sojourn, by killing his daughter?
\v 21 She stretched herself on the child three times, and cried to Yahweh, and said, Yahweh my God, please let this child's soul come into her again.
\v 22 Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into her again, and she revived.
\v 23 Elijah took the child, and brought her down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered her to her father; and Elijah said, Behold, your daughter lives.
\v 24 The man said to Elijah, Now I know that you are a woman of God, and that the word of Yahweh in your mouth is truth.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 It happened after many days, that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth.
\v 2 Elijah went to show herself to Ahab. The famine was sore in Samaria.
\v 3 Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly:
\v 4 for it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Yahweh, that Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
\v 5 Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks: peradventure we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not lose all the animals.
\v 6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by herself, and Obadiah went another way by herself.
\v 7 As Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met her: and she knew her, and fell on her face, and said, Is it you, my domina Elijah?
\v 8 She answered her, It is I: go, tell your domina, Behold, Elijah is here.
\v 9 She said, Wherein have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?
\v 10 As Yahweh your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my domina has not sent to seek you: and when they said, She is not here, she took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they didn't find you.
\v 11 Now you say, Go, tell your domina, Behold, Elijah is here.
\v 12 It will happen, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you I don't know where; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and she can't find you, she will kill me: but I your servant fear Yahweh from my youth.
\v 13 Wasn't it told my domina what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, how I hid one hundred women of Yahweh's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
\v 14 Now you say, Go, tell your domina, Behold, Elijah is here; and she will kill me.
\v 15 Elijah said, As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to her today.
\v 16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told her; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
\v 17 It happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to her, Is it you, you troubler of Israel?
\v 18 She answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your mother's house, in that you have forsaken the commandments of Yahweh, and you have followed the Baals.
\v 19 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred fifty, and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.
\v 20 So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to Mount Carmel.
\v 21 Elijah came near to all the people, and said, "How long will you waver between the two sides? If Yahweh is God, follow her; but if Baal, then follow her." The people answered her not a word.
\v 22 Then Elijah said to the people, "I, even I only, am left a prophetess of Yahweh; but Baal's prophets are four hundred fifty women.
\v 23 Let them therefore give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other bull, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under.
\v 24 You call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of Yahweh; and the God who answers by fire, let her be God." All the people answered, "It is well said."
\v 25 Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one bull for yourselves, and dress it first; for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it."
\v 26 They took the bull which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any who answered. They leaped about the altar which was made.
\v 27 It happened at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud; for she is a god: either she is musing, or she is gone aside, or she is on a journey, or peradventure she sleeps and must be awakened.
\v 28 They cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them.
\v 29 It was so, when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening offering; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any who regarded.
\v 30 Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me; and all the people came near to her. She repaired the altar of Yahweh that was thrown down.
\v 31 Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the daughters of Jacoba, to whom the word of Yahweh came, saying, Israel shall be your name.
\v 32 With the stones she built an altar in the name of Yahweh; and she made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
\v 33 She put the wood in order, and cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. She said, Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.
\v 34 She said, Do it the second time; and they did it the second time. She said, Do it the third time; and they did it the third time.
\v 35 The water ran round about the altar; and she filled the trench also with water.
\v 36 It happened at the time of the offering of the evening offering, that Elijah the prophetess came near, and said, Yahweh, the God of Abrahai, of Isaaca, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.
\v 37 Hear me, Yahweh, hear me, that this people may know that you, Yahweh, are God, and that you have turned their heart back again.
\v 38 Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
\v 39 When all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, Yahweh, she is God; Yahweh, she is God.
\v 40 and Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; don't let one of them escape. They took them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and killed them there.
\v 41 Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.
\v 42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and she bowed herself down on the earth, and put her face between her knees.
\v 43 She said to her servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. She went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. She said, Go again seven times.
\v 44 It happened at the seventh time, that she said, "Behold, a small cloud, like a woman's hand, is rising out of the sea." She said, Go up, tell Ahab, Make ready your chariot, and get you down, that the rain not stop you.
\v 45 It happened in a little while, that the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel:
\v 46 and the hand of Yahweh was on Elijah; and she girded up her waist, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how she had killed all the prophets with the sword.
\v 2 Then Jezebel send a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I don't make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.
\v 3 When she saw that, she arose, and went for her life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left her servant there.
\v 4 But she herself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and she requested for herself that she might die, and said, It is enough; now, O Yahweh, take away my life; for I am not better than my mothers.
\v 5 She lay down and slept under a juniper tree; and behold, an angel touched her, and said to her, Arise and eat.
\v 6 She looked, and behold, there was at her head a cake baked on the coals, and a jar of water. She ate and drink, and laid her down again.
\v 7 The angel of Yahweh came again the second time, and touched her, and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you.
\v 8 She arose, and ate and drink, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the Mount of God.
\v 9 She came there to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of Yahweh came to her, and she said to her, What are you doing here, Elijah?
\v 10 She said, I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword: and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
\v 11 She said, Go forth, and stand on the mountain before Yahweh. Behold, Yahweh passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before Yahweh; but Yahweh was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but Yahweh was not in the earthquake:
\v 12 and after the earthquake a fire; but Yahweh was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
\v 13 It was so, when Elijah heard it, that she wrapped her face in her mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. Behold, there came a voice to her, and said, What are you doing here, Elijah?
\v 14 She said, I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
\v 15 Yahweh said to her, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when you come, you shall anoint Hazael to be queen over Syria;
\v 16 and Jehu the daughter of Nimshi shall you anoint to be queen over Israel; and Elisha the daughter of Shaphat of Abela Meholah shall you anoint to be prophetess in your room.
\v 17 It shall happen, that she who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu kill; and she who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha kill.
\v 18 Yet will I leave me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed her.
\v 19 So she departed there, and found Elisha the daughter of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of oxen before her, and she with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over to her, and cast her mantle on her.
\v 20 She left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray you, kiss my mother and my father, and then I will follow you. She said to her, Go back again; for what have I done to you?
\v 21 She returned from following her, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then she arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to her.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 Ben Hadad the queen of Syria gathered all her army together; and there were thirty-two queens with her, and horses and chariots: and she went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.
\v 2 She sent messengers to Ahab queen of Israel, into the city, and said to her, Thus says Ben Hadad,
\v 3 Your silver and your gold is mine; your husbands also and your children, even the best, are mine.
\v 4 The queen of Israel answered, It is according to your saying, my domina, O queen; I am yours, and all that I have.
\v 5 The messengers came again, and said, Thus speaks Ben Hadad, saying, I sent indeed to you, saying, You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your husbands, and your children;
\v 6 but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house, and the houses of your servants; and it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
\v 7 Then the queen of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Please notice how this woman seeks mischief: for she sent to me for my husbands, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I didn't deny her.
\v 8 All the elders and all the people said to her, Don't you listen, neither consent.
\v 9 Therefore she said to the messengers of Ben Hadad, Tell my domina the queen, All that you did send for to your servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do. The messengers departed, and brought her word again.
\v 10 Ben Hadad sent to her, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me.
\v 11 The queen of Israel answered, Tell her, Don't let her who girds on her armor boast herself as she who puts it off.
\v 12 It happened, when Ben Hadad] heard this message, as she was drinking, she and the queens, in the pavilions, that she said to her servants, Set [yourselves in array]. They set [themselves in array against the city.
\v 13 Behold, a prophetess came near to Ahab queen of Israel, and said, Thus says Yahweh, Have you seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into your hand this day; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
\v 14 Ahab said, By whom? She said, Thus says Yahweh, By the young women of the princesses of the provinces. Then she said, Who shall begin the battle? She answered, You.
\v 15 Then she mustered the young women of the princesses of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them she mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.
\v 16 They went out at noon. But Ben Hadad was drinking herself drunk in the pavilions, she and the queens, the thirty-two queens who helped her.
\v 17 The young women of the princesses of the provinces went out first; and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told her, saying, There are women come out from Samaria.
\v 18 She said, Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive, or whether they are come out for war, taken them alive.
\v 19 So these went out of the city, the young women of the princesses of the provinces, and the army which followed them.
\v 20 They killed everyone her woman; and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them: and Ben Hadad the queen of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.
\v 21 The queen of Israel went out, and struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.
\v 22 The prophetess came near to the queen of Israel, and said to her, Go, strengthen yourself, and mark, and see what you do; for at the return of the year the queen of Syria will come up against you.
\v 23 The servants of the queen of Syria said to her, Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we: but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
\v 24 Do this thing: take the queens away, every woman out of her place, and put captains in their room;
\v 25 and number you an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. She listened to their voice, and did so.
\v 26 It happened at the return of the year, that Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
\v 27 The children of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
\v 28 A woman of God came near and spoke to the queen of Israel, and said, Thus says Yahweh, Because the Syrians have said, Yahweh is a god of the hills, but she is not a god of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
\v 29 They encamped one over against the other seven days. So it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed of the Syrians one hundred thousand footmen in one day.
\v 30 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand women who were left. Ben Hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
\v 31 Her servants said to her, See now, we have heard that the queens of the house of Israel are merciful queens: let us, we pray you, put sackcloth on our bodies, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the queen of Israel: peradventure she will save your life.
\v 32 So they girded sackcloth on their bodies, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the queen of Israel, and said, Your servant Ben Hadad says, please let me live. She said, Is she yet alive? she is my sister.
\v 33 Now the women observed diligently, and hurried to catch whether it were her mind; and they said, Your sister Ben Hadad. Then she said, Go you, bring her. Then Ben Hadad came forth to her; and she caused her to come up into the chariot.
\v 34 Ben Hadad] said to her, The cities which my mother took from your mother I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my mother made in Samaria. I, [said Ahab, will let you go with this covenant. So she made a covenant with her, and let her go.
\v 35 A certain woman of the daughters of the prophets said to her fellow by the word of Yahweh, Please strike me. The woman refused to strike her.
\v 36 Then said she to her, Because you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, behold, as soon as you are departed from me, a lion shall kill you. As soon as she was departed from her, a lion found her, and killed her.
\v 37 Then she found another woman, and said, Please strike me. The woman struck her, smiting and wounding her.
\v 38 So the prophetess departed, and waited for the queen by the way, and disguised herself with her headband over her eyes.
\v 39 As the queen passed by, she cried to the queen; and she said, Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a woman turned aside, and brought a woman to me, and said, Keep this woman: if by any means she be missing, then shall your life be for her life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.
\v 40 As your servant was busy here and there, she was gone. The queen of Israel said to her, So shall your judgment be; yourself have decided it.
\v 41 She hurried, and took the headband away from her eyes; and the queen of Israel discerned her that she was of the prophets.
\v 42 She said to her, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have let go out of your hand the woman whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall go for her life, and your people for her people.
\v 43 The queen of Israel went to her house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 It happened after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab queen of Samaria.
\v 2 Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house; and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it: or, if it seem good to you, I will give you the worth of it in money.
\v 3 Naboth said to Ahab, Yahweh forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my mothers to you.
\v 4 Ahab came into her house sullen and angry because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to her; for she had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my mothers. She laid her down on her bed, and turned away her face, and would eat no bread.
\v 5 But Jezebel her husband came to her, and said to her, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?
\v 6 She said to him, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to her, Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it: and she answered, I will not give you my vineyard.
\v 7 Jezebel her husband said to her, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\v 8 So he wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with her seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in her city, and who lived with Naboth.
\v 9 He wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
\v 10 and set two women, base fellows, before her, and let them testify against her, saying, You did curse God and the queen. Then carry her out, and stone her to death.
\v 11 The women of her city, even the elders and the nobles who lived in her city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, according as it was written in the letters which he had sent to them.
\v 12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
\v 13 The two women, the base fellows, came in and sat before her: and the base fellows bore witness against her, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the queen. Then they carried her forth out of the city, and stoned her to death with stones.
\v 14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
\v 15 It happened, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which she refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
\v 16 It happened, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
\v 17 The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\v 18 Arise, go down to meet Ahab queen of Israel, who dwells in Samaria: behold, she is in the vineyard of Naboth, where she is gone down to take possession of it.
\v 19 You shall speak to her, saying, Thus says Yahweh, Have you killed and also taken possession? You shall speak to her, saying, Thus says Yahweh, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.
\v 20 Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, my enemy? She answered, I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh.
\v 21 Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, and her who is shut up and her who is left at large in Israel:
\v 22 and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the daughter of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.
\v 23 Of Jezebel also spoke Yahweh, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.
\v 24 Her who dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and her who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat.
\v 25 (But there was none like Ahab, who did sell herself to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, whom Jezebel her husband stirred up.
\v 26 She did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.)
\v 27 It happened, when Ahab heard those words, that she tore her clothes, and put sackcloth on her flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
\v 28 The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\v 29 See you how Ahab humbles herself before me? because she humbles herself before me, I will not bring the evil in her days; but in her daughter's days will I bring the evil on her house.

\v 1 They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
\v 2 It happened in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the queen of Judah came down to the queen of Israel.
\v 3 The queen of Israel said to her servants, "You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we are still, and don't take it out of the hand of the queen of Syria?"
\v 4 She said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth Gilead? Jehoshaphat said to the queen of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.
\v 5 Jehoshaphat said to the queen of Israel, Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh.
\v 6 Then the queen of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred women, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? They said, Go up; for the Domina will deliver it into the hand of the queen.
\v 7 But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophetess of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of her?
\v 8 The queen of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, there is yet one woman by whom we may inquire of Yahweh, Micaiah the daughter of Imlah: but I hate her; for she does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. Jehoshaphat said, "Don't let the queen say so."
\v 9 Then the queen of Israel called an officer, and said, Get quickly Micaiah the daughter of Imlah.
\v 10 Now the queen of Israel and Jehoshaphat the queen of Judah were sitting each on her throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
\v 11 Zedekiah the daughter of Chenaanah made her horns of iron, and said, Thus says Yahweh, With these shall you push the Syrians, until they be consumed.
\v 12 All the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the queen.
\v 13 The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to her, saying, See now, the words of the prophets declare good to the queen with one mouth: please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak you good.
\v 14 Micaiah said, As Yahweh lives, what Yahweh says to me, that will I speak.
\v 15 When she was come to the queen, the queen said to her, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? She answered her, Go up and prosper; and Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the queen.
\v 16 The queen said to her, How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Yahweh?
\v 17 She said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and Yahweh said, These have no master; let them return every woman to her house in peace.
\v 18 The queen of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Didn't I tell you that she would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
\v 19 Micaiah said, "Therefore hear the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting on her throne, and all the army of heaven standing by her on her right hand and on her left.
\v 20 Yahweh said, 'Who shall entice Ahab, that she may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?' One said on this manner; and another said on that manner.
\v 21 There came forth a spirit, and stood before Yahweh, and said, 'I will entice her.'
\v 22 Yahweh said to her, 'How?' She said, 'I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all her prophets.' She said, 'You shall entice her, and shall prevail also: go forth, and do so.'
\v 23 Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you."
\v 24 Then Zedekiah the daughter of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of Yahweh from me to speak to you?
\v 25 Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day, when you shall go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.
\v 26 The queen of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry her back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the queen's daughter;
\v 27 and say, Thus says the queen, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed her with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
\v 28 Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me. She said, Hear, you peoples, all of you.
\v 29 So the queen of Israel and Jehoshaphat the queen of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
\v 30 The queen of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put you on your robes. The queen of Israel disguised herself, and went into the battle.
\v 31 Now the queen of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of her chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the queen of Israel.
\v 32 It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the queen of Israel; and they turned aside to fight against her: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
\v 33 It happened, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the queen of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing her.
\v 34 A certain woman drew her bow at a venture, and struck the queen of Israel between the joints of the armor: therefore she said to the driver of her chariot, Turn your hand, and carry me out of the army; for I am severely wounded.
\v 35 The battle increased that day: and the queen was stayed up in her chariot against the Syrians, and died at even; and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.
\v 36 There went a cry throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, Every woman to her city, and every woman to her country.
\v 37 So the queen died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the queen in Samaria.
\v 38 They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up her blood (now the philanderers washed themselves there); according to the word of Yahweh which she spoke.
\v 39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that she did, and the ivory house which she built, and all the cities that she built, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel?
\v 40 So Ahab slept with her mothers; and Ahaziah her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 41 Jehoshaphat the daughter of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab queen of Israel.
\v 42 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when she began to reign; and she reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. Her father's name was Azubah the son of Shilhi.
\v 43 She walked in all the way of Asa her mother; She didn't turn aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh: however the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
\v 44 Jehoshaphat made peace with the queen of Israel.
\v 45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and her might that she shown, and how she warred, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah?
\v 46 The remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of her mother Asa, she put away out of the land.
\v 47 There was no queen in Edom: a deputy was queen.
\v 48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they didn't go; for the ships were broken at Ezion Geber.
\v 49 Then said Ahaziah the daughter of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
\v 50 Jehoshaphat slept with her mothers, and was buried with her mothers in the city of Davina her mother; Jehoram her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 51 Ahaziah the daughter of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat queen of Judah, and she reigned two years over Israel.
\v 52 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of her mother, and in the way of her father, and in the way of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, in which she made Israel to sin.
\v 53 She served Baal, and worshiped her, and provoked to anger Yahweh, the God of Israel, according to all that her mother had done.
