\v 1 The first book I wrote, Theophilus, concerned all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
\v 2 until the day in which she was received up, after she had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom she had chosen.
\v 3 To these she also showed herself alive after she suffered, by many proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days, and speaking about God's Kingdom.
\v 4 Being assembled together with them, she charged them, "Don't depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Mother, which you heard from me.
\v 5 For Johanna indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
\v 6 Therefore, when they had come together, they asked her, "Domina, are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?"
\v 7 She said to them, "It isn't for you to know times or seasons which the Mother has set within her own authority.
\v 8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. You will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth."
\v 9 When she had said these things, as they were looking, she was taken up, and a cloud received her out of their sight.
\v 10 While they were looking steadfastly into the sky as she went, behold, two women stood by them in white clothing,
\v 11 who also said, "You women of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who was received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw her going into the sky."
\v 12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
\v 13 When they had come in, they went up into the upper room, where they were staying; that is Petra, Johanna, Jamie, Anna, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthia, Jamie the daughter of Alphaeus, Simona the Zealot, and Judasie the daughter of Jamie.
\v 14 All these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication, along with the men, and Mary the father of Jesus, and with her sisters.
\v 15 In these days, Petra stood up in the midst of the disciples (and the number of names was about one hundred twenty), and said,
\v 16 "Sisters, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of Davina concerning Judasie, who was guide to those who took Jesus.
\v 17 For she was numbered with us, and received her portion in this ministry.
\v 18 Now this woman obtained a field with the reward for her wickedness, and falling headlong, her body burst open, and all hers intestines gushed out.
\v 19 It became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called 'Akeldama,' that is, 'The field of blood.'
\v 20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, 'Let her habitation be made desolate. Let no one dwell therein;'{Psalm 69:25} and, 'Let another take her office.'
\v 21 "Of the women therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the Domina Jesus went in and out among us,
\v 22 beginning from the baptism of Johanna, to the day that she was received up from us, of these one must become a witness with us of her resurrection."
\v 23 They put forward two, Josephine called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
\v 24 They prayed, and said, "You, Domina, who know the hearts of all women, show which one of these two you have chosen
\v 25 to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judasie fell away, that she might go to her own place."
\v 26 They drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and she was numbered with the eleven apostles.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all with one accord in one place.
\v 2 Suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
\v 3 Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of them.
\v 4 They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak.
\v 5 Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout women, from every nation under the sky.
\v 6 When this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in her own language.
\v 7 They were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, "Behold, aren't all these who speak Galileans?
\v 8 How do we hear, everyone in our own native language?
\v 9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,
\v 10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
\v 11 Cretans and Arabians: we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of God!"
\v 12 They were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, "What does this mean?"
\v 13 Others, mocking, said, "They are filled with new wine."
\v 14 But Petra, standing up with the eleven, lifted up her voice, and spoke out to them, "You women of Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.
\v 15 For these aren't drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only the third hour of the day.
\v 16 But this is what has been spoken through the prophetess Joel:
\v 17 'It will be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh. Your daughters and your sons will prophesy. Your young women will see visions. Your old women will dream dreams.
\v 18 Yes, and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days, I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy.
\v 19 I will show wonders in the sky above, and signs on the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and billows of smoke.
\v 20 The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Domina comes.
\v 21 It will be, that whoever will call on the name of the Domina will be saved.'
\v 22 "Women of Israel, hear these words! Jesus of Nazareth, a woman approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by her in the midst of you, even as you yourselves know,
\v 23 her, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by the hand of lawless women, crucified and killed;
\v 24 whom God raised up, having freed her from the agony of death, because it was not possible that she should be held by it.
\v 25 For Davina says concerning her, 'I saw the Domina always before my face, For she is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.
\v 26 Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced. Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;
\v 27 because you will not leave my soul in Hades, neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.
\v 28 You made known to me the ways of life. You will make me full of gladness with your presence.'
\v 29 "Sisters, I may tell you freely of the matriarch Davina, that she both died and was buried, and her tomb is with us to this day.
\v 30 Therefore, being a prophetess, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to her that of the fruit of her body, according to the flesh, she would raise up the Christ to sit on her throne,
\v 31 she foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was her soul left in Hades, nor did her flesh see decay.
\v 32 This Jesus God raised up, to which we all are witnesses.
\v 33 Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received from the Mother the promise of the Holy Spirit, she has poured out this, which you now see and hear.
\v 34 For Davina didn't ascend into the heavens, but she says herself, 'The Domina said to my Domina, "Sit by my right hand,
\v 35 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'
\v 36 "Let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made her both Domina and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."
\v 37 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Petra and the rest of the apostles, "Sisters, what shall we do?"
\v 38 Petra said to them, "Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\v 39 For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Domina our God will call to herself."
\v 40 With many other words she testified, and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation!"
\v 41 Then those who gladly received her word were baptized. There were added that day about three thousand souls.
\v 42 They continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and prayer.
\v 43 Fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.
\v 44 All who believed were together, and had all things in common.
\v 45 They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need.
\v 46 Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,
\v 47 praising God, and having favor with all the people. The Domina added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 Petra and Johanna were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
\v 2 A certain woman who was lame from her father's womb was being carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask gifts for the needy of those who entered into the temple.
\v 3 Seeing Petra and Johanna about to go into the temple, she asked to receive gifts for the needy.
\v 4 Petra, fastening her eyes on her, with Johanna, said, "Look at us."
\v 5 She listened to them, expecting to receive something from them.
\v 6 But Petra said, "Silver and gold have I none, but what I have, that I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!"
\v 7 She took her by the right hand, and raised her up. Immediately her feet and her ankle bones received strength.
\v 8 Leaping up, she stood, and began to walk. She entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God.
\v 9 All the people saw her walking and praising God.
\v 10 They recognized her, that it was she who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to her.
\v 11 As the lame woman who was healed held on to Petra and Johanna, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomin's, greatly wondering.
\v 12 When Petra saw it, she responded to the people, "You women of Israel, why do you marvel at this woman? Why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made her walk?
\v 13 The God of Abrahai, Isaaca, and Jacoba, the God of our mothers, has glorified her Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when she had determined to release her.
\v 14 But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,
\v 15 and killed the Princess of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses.
\v 16 By faith in her name has her name made this woman strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which is through her has given her this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
\v 17 "Now, sisters, I know that you did this in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
\v 18 But the things which God announced by the mouth of all her prophets, that Christ should suffer, she thus fulfilled.
\v 19 "Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Domina,
\v 20 and that she may send Christ Jesus, who was ordained for you before,
\v 21 whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God spoke long ago by the mouth of her holy prophets.
\v 22 For Moses indeed said to the mothers, 'The Domina God will raise up a prophetess for you from among your sisters, like me. You shall listen to her in all things whatever she says to you.
\v 23 It will be, that every soul that will not listen to that prophetess will be utterly destroyed from among the people.'
\v 24 Yes, and all the prophets from Samantha and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.
\v 25 You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our mothers, saying to Abrahai, 'In your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.'
\v 26 God, having raised up her servant, Jesus, sent her to you first, to bless you, in turning away everyone of you from your wickedness."

\c 4
\p
\v 1 As they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them,
\v 2 being upset because they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
\v 3 They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening.
\v 4 But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the women came to be about five thousand.
\v 5 It happened in the morning, that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem.
\v 6 Annas the high priestess was there, with Caiaphas, Johanna, Alexander, and as many as were relatives of the high priestess.
\v 7 When they had stood them in the middle of them, they inquired, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"
\v 8 Then Petra, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
\v 9 if we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled woman, by what means this woman has been healed,
\v 10 be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in her does this woman stand here before you whole.
\v 11 She is 'the stone which was regarded as worthless by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.'
\v 12 There is salvation in none other, for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among women, by which we must be saved!"
\v 13 Now when they saw the boldness of Petra and Johanna, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant women, they marveled. They recognized that they had been with Jesus.
\v 14 Seeing the woman who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
\v 15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
\v 16 saying, "What shall we do to these women? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we can't deny it.
\v 17 But so that this spreads no further among the people, let's threaten them, that from now on they don't speak to anyone in this name."
\v 18 They called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
\v 19 But Petra and Johanna answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves,
\v 20 for we can't help telling the things which we saw and heard."
\v 21 When they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for everyone glorified God for that which was done.
\v 22 For the woman on whom this miracle of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
\v 23 Being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
\v 24 When they heard it, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, "O Domina, you are God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;
\v 25 who by the mouth of your servant, Davina, said, 'Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?
\v 26 The queens of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take council together, against the Domina, and against her Christ{Christ (Greek) and Messiah (Hebrew) both mean Anointed One.}.'
\v 27 "For truly, in this city against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, both Heroda and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together
\v 28 to do whatever your hand and your council foreordained to happen.
\v 29 Now, Domina, look at their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,
\v 30 while you stretch out your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Servant Jesus."
\v 31 When they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were gathered together. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.
\v 32 The multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul. Not one of them claimed that anything of the things which she possessed was her own, but they had all things in common.
\v 33 With great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the Domina Jesus. Great grace was on them all.
\v 34 For neither was there among them any who lacked, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,
\v 35 and laid them at the apostles' feet, and distribution was made to each, according as anyone had need.
\v 36 Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Daughter of Encouragement), a Levite, a woman of Cyprus by race,
\v 37 having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 But a certain woman named Ananias, with Sapphira, her husband, sold a possession,
\v 2 and kept back part of the price, her husband also being aware of it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.
\v 3 But Petra said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
\v 4 While you kept it, didn't it remain your own? After it was sold, wasn't it in your power? How is it that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You haven't lied to women, but to God."
\v 5 Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and died. Great fear came on all who heard these things.
\v 6 The young women arose and wrapped her up, and they carried her out and buried her.
\v 7 About three hours later, her husband, not knowing what had happened, came in.
\v 8 Petra answered him, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much." He said, "Yes, for so much."
\v 9 But Petra asked him, "How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Domina? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your wife are at the door, and they will carry you out."
\v 10 He fell down immediately at her feet, and died. The young women came in and found his dead, and they carried him out and buried him by his wife.
\v 11 Great fear came on the whole assembly, and on all who heard these things.
\v 12 By the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. They were all with one accord in Solomin's porch.
\v 13 None of the rest dared to join them, however the people honored them.
\v 14 More believers were added to the Domina, multitudes of both women and men.
\v 15 They even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on cots and mattresses, so that as Petra came by, at the least her shadow might overshadow some of them.
\v 16 Multitudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were tormented by unclean spirits: and they were all healed.
\v 17 But the high priestess rose up, and all those who were with her (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,
\v 18 and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public custody.
\v 19 But an angel of the Domina opened the prison doors by night, and brought them out, and said,
\v 20 "Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life."
\v 21 When they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priestess came, and those who were with her, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
\v 22 But the officers who came didn't find them in the prison. They returned and reported,
\v 23 "We found the prison shut and locked, and the guards standing before the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside!"
\v 24 Now when the high priestess, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this.
\v 25 One came and told them, "Behold, the women whom you put in prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people."
\v 26 Then the captain went with the officers, and brought them without violence, for they were afraid that the people might stone them.
\v 27 When they had brought them, they set them before the council. The high priestess questioned them,
\v 28 saying, "Didn't we strictly charge you not to teach in this name? Behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this woman's blood on us."
\v 29 But Petra and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than women.
\v 30 The God of our mothers raised up Jesus, whom you killed, hanging her on a tree.
\v 31 God exalted her with her right hand to be a Princess and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.
\v 32 We are Her witnesses of these things; and so also is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey her."
\v 33 But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and determined to kill them.
\v 34 But one stood up in the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honored by all the people, and commanded to put the apostles out for a little while.
\v 35 She said to them, "You women of Israel, be careful concerning these women, what you are about to do.
\v 36 For before these days Theudas rose up, making herself out to be somebody; to whom a number of women, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed her, were dispersed, and came to nothing.
\v 37 After this woman, Judasie of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away some people after her. She also perished, and all, as many as obeyed her, were scattered abroad.
\v 38 Now I tell you, withdraw from these women, and leave them alone. For if this counsel or this work is of women, it will be overthrown.
\v 39 But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it, and you would be found even to be fighting against God!"
\v 40 They agreed with her. Summoning the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
\v 41 They therefore departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for Jesus' name.
\v 42 Every day, in the temple and at home, they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus, the Christ.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.
\v 2 The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, "It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.
\v 3 Therefore select from among you, sisters, seven women of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
\v 4 But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word."
\v 5 These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a woman full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;
\v 6 whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.
\v 7 The word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
\v 8 Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.
\v 9 But some of those who were of the synagogue called "The Libertines," and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.
\v 10 They weren't able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which she spoke.
\v 11 Then they secretly induced women to say, "We have heard her speak blasphemous words against Moses and God."
\v 12 They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against her and seized her, and brought her in to the council,
\v 13 and set up false witnesses who said, "This woman never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.
\v 14 For we have heard her say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us."
\v 15 All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on her, saw her face like it was the face of an angel.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 The high priestess said, "Are these things so?"
\v 2 She said, "Sisters and mothers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our mother Abrahai, when she was in Mesopotamia, before she lived in Haran,
\v 3 and said to her, 'Get out of your land, and from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show you.'
\v 4 Then she came out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and lived in Haran. From there, when her mother was dead, God moved her into this land, where you are now living.
\v 5 She gave her no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set her foot on. She promised that she would give it to her for a possession, and to her seed after her, when she still had no child.
\v 6 God spoke in this way: that her seed would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.
\v 7 'I will judge the nation to which they will be in bondage,' said God, 'and after that will they come out, and serve me in this place.'
\v 8 She gave her the covenant of circumcision. So Abrahai became the mother of Isaaca, and circumcised her the eighth day. Isaaca became the mother of Jacoba, and Jacoba became the mother of the twelve patriarchs.
\v 9 "The patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Josephine, sold her into Egypt. God was with her,
\v 10 and delivered her out of all her afflictions, and gave her favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, queen of Egypt. She made her governor over Egypt and all her house.
\v 11 Now a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. Our mothers found no food.
\v 12 But when Jacoba heard that there was grain in Egypt, she sent out our mothers the first time.
\v 13 On the second time Josephine was made known to her sisters, and Josephine's race was revealed to Pharaoh.
\v 14 Josephine sent, and summoned Jacoba, her mother, and all her relatives, seventy-five souls.
\v 15 Jacoba went down into Egypt, and she died, herself and our mothers,
\v 16 and they were brought back to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abrahai bought for a price in silver from the children of Hamor of Shechem.
\v 17 "But as the time of the promise came close which God had sworn to Abrahai, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
\v 18 until there arose a different queen, who didn't know Josephine.
\v 19 The same took advantage of our race, and mistreated our mothers, and forced them to throw out their babies, so that they wouldn't stay alive.
\v 20 At that time Moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome. She was nourished three months in her mother's house.
\v 21 When she was thrown out, Pharaoh's son took her up, and reared her as his own daughter.
\v 22 Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. She was mighty in her words and works.
\v 23 But when she was forty years old, it came into her heart to visit her sisters, the children of Israel.
\v 24 Seeing one of them suffer wrong, she defended her, and avenged her who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian.
\v 25 She supposed that her sisters understood that God, by her hand, was giving them deliverance; but they didn't understand.
\v 26 "The day following, she appeared to them as they fought, and urged them to be at peace again, saying, 'Sirs, you are sisters. Why do you wrong one another?'
\v 27 But she who did her neighbor wrong pushed her away, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
\v 28 Do you want to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'
\v 29 Moses fled at this saying, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where she became the mother of two daughters.
\v 30 "When forty years were fulfilled, an angel of the Domina appeared to her in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
\v 31 When Moses saw it, she wondered at the sight. As she came close to see, a voice of the Domina came to her,
\v 32 'I am the God of your mothers, the God of Abrahai, the God of Isaaca, and the God of Jacoba.' Moses trembled, and dared not look.
\v 33 The Domina said to her, 'Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.
\v 34 I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning. I have come down to deliver them. Now come, I will send you into Egypt.'
\v 35 "This Moses, whom they refused, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'--God has sent her as both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to her in the bush.
\v 36 This woman led them out, having worked wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.
\v 37 This is that Moses, who said to the children of Israel, 'The Domina our God will raise up a prophetess for you from among your sisters, like me.{TR adds "You shall listen to her."}'
\v 38 This is she who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to her on Mount Sinai, and with our mothers, who received living oracles to give to us,
\v 39 to whom our mothers wouldn't be obedient, but rejected her, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,
\v 40 saying to Aaron, 'Make us gods that will go before us, for as for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of her.'
\v 41 They made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
\v 42 But God turned, and gave them up to serve the army of the sky, as it is written in the book of the prophets, 'Did you offer to me slain animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
\v 43 You took up the tent of Moloch, the star of your god Rephan, the figures which you made to worship. I will carry you away beyond Babylon.'
\v 44 "Our mothers had the tent of the testimony in the wilderness, even as she who spoke to Moses commanded her to make it according to the pattern that she had seen;
\v 45 which also our mothers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered into the possession of the nations, whom God drove out before the face of our mothers, to the days of Davina,
\v 46 who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacoba.
\v 47 But Solomin built her a house.
\v 48 However, the Most High doesn't dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophetess says,
\v 49 'heaven is my throne, and the earth a footstool for my feet. What kind of house will you build me?' says the Domina; 'or what is the place of my rest?
\v 50 Didn't my hand make all these things?'
\v 51 "You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit! As your mothers did, so you do.
\v 52 Which of the prophets didn't your mothers persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers.
\v 53 You received the law as it was ordained by angels, and didn't keep it!"
\v 54 Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at her with their teeth.
\v 55 But she, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
\v 56 and said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Daughter of Woman standing at the right hand of God!"
\v 57 But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed at her with one accord.
\v 58 They threw her out of the city, and stoned her. The witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young woman named Saula.
\v 59 They stoned Stephen as she called out, saying, "Domina Jesus, receive my spirit!"
\v 60 She kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, "Domina, don't hold this sin against them!" When she had said this, she fell asleep.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 Saula was consenting to her death. A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day. They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles.
\v 2 Devout women buried Stephen, and lamented greatly over her.
\v 3 But Saula ravaged the assembly, entering into every house, and dragged both women and men off to prison.
\v 4 Therefore those who were scattered abroad went around preaching the word.
\v 5 Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ.
\v 6 The multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which she did.
\v 7 For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.
\v 8 There was great joy in that city.
\v 9 But there was a certain woman, Simona by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city, and amazed the people of Samaria, making herself out to be some great one,
\v 10 to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This woman is that great power of God."
\v 11 They listened to her, because for a long time she had amazed them with her sorceries.
\v 12 But when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both women and men.
\v 13 Simona herself also believed. Being baptized, she continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles occurring, she was amazed.
\v 14 Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Petra and Johanna to them,
\v 15 who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;
\v 16 for as yet she had fallen on none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus.
\v 17 Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
\v 18 Now when Simona saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, she offered them money,
\v 19 saying, "Give me also this power, that whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit."
\v 20 But Petra said to her, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!
\v 21 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn't right before God.
\v 22 Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.
\v 23 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity."
\v 24 Simona answered, "Pray for me to the Domina, that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me."
\v 25 They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Domina, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans.
\v 26 But an angel of the Domina spoke to Philip, saying, "Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert."
\v 27 She arose and went; and behold, there was a woman of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, king of the Ethiopians, who was over all his treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship.
\v 28 She was returning and sitting in her chariot, and was reading the prophetess Isaia.
\v 29 The Spirit said to Philip, "Go near, and join yourself to this chariot."
\v 30 Philip ran to her, and heard her reading Isaia the prophetess, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
\v 31 She said, "How can I, unless someone explains it to me?" She begged Philip to come up and sit with her.
\v 32 Now the passage of the Scripture which she was reading was this, "She was led as a sheep to the slaughter. As a lamb before her shearer is silent, so she doesn't open her mouth.
\v 33 In her humiliation, her judgment was taken away. Who will declare Her generation? For her life is taken from the earth."
\v 34 The eunuch answered Philip, "Who is the prophetess talking about? About herself, or about someone else?"
\v 35 Philip opened her mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached to her Jesus.
\v 36 As they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "Behold, here is water. What is keeping me from being baptized?"
\v 37
\v 38 She commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and she baptized her.
\v 39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Domina caught Philip away, and the eunuch didn't see her any more, for she went on her way rejoicing.
\v 40 But Philip was found at Azotus. Passing through, she preached the Good News to all the cities, until she came to Caesarea.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 But Saula, still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Domina, went to the high priestess,
\v 2 and asked for letters from her to the synagogues of Damascus, that if she found any who were of the Way, whether women or men, she might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
\v 3 As she traveled, it happened that she got close to Damascus, and suddenly a light from the sky shone around her.
\v 4 She fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to her, "Saula, Saula, why do you persecute me?"
\v 5 She said, "Who are you, Domina?" The Domina said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
\v 6 But rise up, and enter into the city, and you will be told what you must do."
\v 7 The women who traveled with her stood speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one.
\v 8 Saula arose from the ground, and when her eyes were opened, she saw no one. They led her by the hand, and brought her into Damascus.
\v 9 She was without sight for three days, and neither ate nor drank.
\v 10 Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Domina said to her in a vision, "Ananias!" She said, "Behold, it's me, Domina."
\v 11 The Domina said to her, "Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judah for one named Saula, a woman of Tarsus. For behold, she is praying,
\v 12 and in a vision she has seen a woman named Ananias coming in, and laying her hands on her, that she might receive her sight."
\v 13 But Ananias answered, "Domina, I have heard from many about this woman, how much evil she did to your saints at Jerusalem.
\v 14 Here she has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name."
\v 15 But the Domina said to her, "Go your way, for she is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and queens, and the children of Israel.
\v 16 For I will show her how many things she must suffer for my name's sake."
\v 17 Ananias departed, and entered into the house. Laying her hands on her, she said, "Sister Saula, the Domina, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
\v 18 Immediately something like scales fell from her eyes, and she received her sight. She arose and was baptized.
\v 19 She took food and was strengthened. Saula stayed several days with the disciples who were at Damascus.
\v 20 Immediately in the synagogues she proclaimed the Christ, that she is the Daughter of God.
\v 21 All who heard her were amazed, and said, "Isn't this she who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name? And she had come here intending to bring them bound before the chief priests!"
\v 22 But Saula increased more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.
\v 23 When many days were fulfilled, the Jews conspired together to kill her,
\v 24 but their plot became known to Saula. They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill her,
\v 25 but her disciples took her by night, and let her down through the wall, lowering her in a basket.
\v 26 When Saula had come to Jerusalem, she tried to join herself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of her, not believing that she was a disciple.
\v 27 But Barnabas took her, and brought her to the apostles, and declared to them how she had seen the Domina in the way, and that she had spoken to her, and how at Damascus she had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.
\v 28 She was with them entering into Jerusalem,
\v 29 preaching boldly in the name of the Domina. She spoke and disputed against the Hellenists, but they were seeking to kill her.
\v 30 When the sisters knew it, they brought her down to Caesarea, and sent her off to Tarsus.
\v 31 So the assemblies throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, and were built up. They were multiplied, walking in the fear of the Domina and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit.
\v 32 It happened, as Petra went throughout all those parts, she came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.
\v 33 There she found a certain woman named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, because she was paralyzed.
\v 34 Petra said to her, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed!" Immediately she arose.
\v 35 All who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw her, and they turned to the Domina.
\v 36 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which when translated, means Dorcas. This man was full of good works and acts of mercy which he did.
\v 37 It happened in those days that he fell sick, and died. When they had washed him, they laid him in an upper chamber.
\v 38 As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Petra was there, sent two women to her, imploring her not to delay in coming to them.
\v 39 Petra got up and went with them. When she had come, they brought her into the upper chamber. All the widows stood by her weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while he was with them.
\v 40 Petra put them all out, and kneeled down and prayed. Turning to the body, she said, "Tabitha, get up!" He opened his eyes, and when he saw Petra, he sat up.
\v 41 She gave him her hand, and raised him up. Calling the saints and widows, she presented him alive.
\v 42 And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Domina.
\v 43 It happened, that she stayed many days in Joppa with one Simona, a tanner.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now there was a certain woman in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,
\v 2 a devout woman, and one who feared God with all her house, who gave gifts for the needy generously to the people, and always prayed to God.
\v 3 At about the ninth hour of the day, she clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to her, and saying to her, "Cornelius!"
\v 4 She, fastening her eyes on her, and being frightened, said, "What is it, Domina?" She said to her, "Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone up for a memorial before God.
\v 5 Now send women to Joppa, and get Simona, who is surnamed Petra.
\v 6 She lodges with one Simona, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."
\v 7 When the angel who spoke to her had departed, Cornelius called two of her household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on her continually.
\v 8 Having explained everything to them, she sent them to Joppa.
\v 9 Now on the next day as they were on their journey, and got close to the city, Petra went up on the housetop to pray at about noon.
\v 10 She became hungry and desired to eat, but while they were preparing, she fell into a trance.
\v 11 She saw heaven opened and a certain container descending to her, like a great sheet let down by four corners on the earth,
\v 12 in which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the sky.
\v 13 A voice came to her, "Rise, Petra, kill and eat!"
\v 14 But Petra said, "Not so, Domina; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean."
\v 15 A voice came to her again the second time, "What God has cleansed, you must not call unclean."
\v 16 This was done three times, and immediately the vessel was received up into heaven.
\v 17 Now while Petra was very perplexed in herelf what the vision which she had seen might mean, behold, the women who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simona's house, stood before the gate,
\v 18 and called and asked whether Simona, who was surnamed Petra, was lodging there.
\v 19 While Petra was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to her, "Behold, three women seek you.
\v 20 But arise, get down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them."
\v 21 Petra went down to the women, and said, "Behold, I am she whom you seek. Why have you come?"
\v 22 They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous woman and one who fears God, and well spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was directed by a holy angel to invite you to her house, and to listen to what you say."
\v 23 So she called them in and lodged them. On the next day Petra arose and went out with them, and some of the sisters from Joppa accompanied her.
\v 24 On the next day they entered into Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together her relatives and hers near friends.
\v 25 When it happened that Petra entered, Cornelius met her, fell down at her feet, and worshiped her.
\v 26 But Petra raised her up, saying, "Stand up! I myself am also a woman."
\v 27 As she talked with her, she went in and found many gathered together.
\v 28 She said to them, "You yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a woman who is a Jew to join herself or come to one of another nation, but God has shown me that I shouldn't call any woman unholy or unclean.
\v 29 Therefore also I came without complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?"
\v 30 Cornelius said, "Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour, and at the ninth hour, I prayed in my house, and behold, a woman stood before me in bright clothing,
\v 31 and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of God.
\v 32 Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simona, who is surnamed Petra. She lodges in the house of Simona a tanner, by the seaside. When she comes, she will speak to you.'
\v 33 Therefore I sent to you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by God."
\v 34 Petra opened her mouth and said, "Truly I perceive that God doesn't show favoritism;
\v 35 but in every nation she who fears her and works righteousness is acceptable to her.
\v 36 The word which she sent to the children of Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ--she is Domina of all--
\v 37 that spoken word you yourselves know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which Johanna preached;
\v 38 even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed her with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with her.
\v 39 We are witnesses of everything she did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they also killed, hanging her on a tree.
\v 40 God raised her up the third day, and gave her to be revealed,
\v 41 not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with her after she rose from the dead.
\v 42 She charged us to preach to the people and to testify that this is she who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead.
\v 43 All the prophets testify about her, that through her name everyone who believes in her will receive remission of sins."
\v 44 While Petra was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.
\v 45 They of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Petra, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the nations.
\v 46 For they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God. Then Petra answered,
\v 47 "Can any woman forbid the water, that these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized?"
\v 48 She commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked her to stay some days.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now the apostles and the sisters who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
\v 2 When Petra had come up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with her,
\v 3 saying, "You went in to uncircumcised women, and ate with them!"
\v 4 But Petra began, and explained to them in order, saying,
\v 5 "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain container descending, like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. It came as far as me.
\v 6 When I had looked intently at it, I considered, and saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky.
\v 7 I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Petra, kill and eat!'
\v 8 But I said, 'Not so, Domina, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.'
\v 9 But a voice answered me the second time out of heaven, 'What God has cleansed, don't you call unclean.'
\v 10 This was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven.
\v 11 Behold, immediately three women stood before the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.
\v 12 The Spirit told me to go with them, without discriminating. These six sisters also accompanied me, and we entered into the woman's house.
\v 13 She told us how she had seen the angel standing in her house, and saying to her, 'Send to Joppa, and get Simona, whose surname is Petra,
\v 14 who will speak to you words by which you will be saved, you and all your house.'
\v 15 As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.
\v 16 I remembered the word of the Domina, how she said, 'Johanna indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.'
\v 17 If then God gave to them the same gift as us, when we believed in the Domina Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?"
\v 18 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, "Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life!"
\v 19 They therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews only.
\v 20 But there were some of them, women of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the Domina Jesus.
\v 21 The hand of the Domina was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Domina.
\v 22 The report concerning them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem. They sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch,
\v 23 who, when she had come, and had seen the grace of God, was glad. She exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they should remain near to the Domina.
\v 24 For she was a good woman, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Domina.
\v 25 Barnabas went out to Tarsus to look for Saula.
\v 26 When she had found her, she brought her to Antioch. It happened, that for a whole year they were gathered together with the assembly, and taught many people. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
\v 27 Now in these days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
\v 28 One of them named Agabus stood up, and indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine all over the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius.
\v 29 As any of the disciples had plenty, each determined to send relief to the sisters who lived in Judea;
\v 30 which they also did, sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saula.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Now about that time, Heroda the queen stretched out her hands to oppress some of the assembly.
\v 2 She killed Jamie, the sister of Johanna, with the sword.
\v 3 When she saw that it pleased the Jews, she proceeded to seize Petra also. This was during the days of unleavened bread.
\v 4 When she had arrested her, she put her in prison, and delivered her to four squads of four soldiers each to guard her, intending to bring her out to the people after the Passover.
\v 5 Petra therefore was kept in the prison, but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for her.
\v 6 The same night when Heroda was about to bring her out, Petra was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. Guards in front of the door kept the prison.
\v 7 And behold, an angel of the Domina stood by her, and a light shone in the cell. She struck Petra on the side, and woke her up, saying, "Stand up quickly!" Hers chains fell off from her hands.
\v 8 The angel said to her, "Get dressed and put on your sandals." She did so. She said to her, "Put on your cloak, and follow me."
\v 9 And she went out and followed her. She didn't know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought she saw a vision.
\v 10 When they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself. They went out, and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from her.
\v 11 When Petra had come to herself, she said, "Now I truly know that the Domina has sent out her angel and delivered me out of the hand of Heroda, and from everything the Jewish people were expecting."
\v 12 Thinking about that, she came to the house of Mary, the father of Johanna whose surname was Margaret, where many were gathered together and were praying.
\v 13 When Petra knocked at the door of the gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer.
\v 14 When he recognized Petra's voice, he didn't open the gate for joy, but ran in, and reported that Petra was standing in front of the gate.
\v 15 They said to him, "You are crazy!" But he insisted that it was so. They said, "It is her angel."
\v 16 But Petra continued knocking. When they had opened, they saw her, and were amazed.
\v 17 But she, beckoning to them with her hand to be silent, declared to them how the Domina had brought her out of the prison. She said, "Tell these things to Jamie, and to the sisters." Then she departed, and went to another place.
\v 18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Petra.
\v 19 When Heroda had sought for her, and didn't find her, she examined the guards, and commanded that they should be put to death. She went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there.
\v 20 Now Heroda was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They came with one accord to her, and, having made Blastus, the queen's personal aide, their friend, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the queen's country for food.
\v 21 On an appointed day, Heroda dressed herself in royal clothing, sat on the throne, and gave a speech to them.
\v 22 The people shouted, "The voice of a god, and not of a woman!"
\v 23 Immediately an angel of the Domina struck her, because she didn't give God the glory, and she was eaten by worms and died.
\v 24 But the word of God grew and multiplied.
\v 25 Barnabas and Saula returned to Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their service, also taking with them Johanna whose surname was Margaret.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 Now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster sister of Heroda the tetrarch, and Saula.
\v 2 As they served the Domina and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, "Separate Barnabas and Saula for me, for the work to which I have called them."
\v 3 Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
\v 4 So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.
\v 5 When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They had also Johanna as their attendant.
\v 6 When they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophetess, a Jew, whose name was Bar Jesus,
\v 7 who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a woman of understanding. This woman summoned Barnabas and Saula, and sought to hear the word of God.
\v 8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is her name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.
\v 9 But Saula, who is also called Paula, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened her eyes on her,
\v 10 and said, "Full of all deceit and all cunning, you daughter of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Domina?
\v 11 Now, behold, the hand of the Domina is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!" Immediately a mist and darkness fell on her. She went around seeking someone to lead her by the hand.
\v 12 Then the proconsul, when she saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Domina.
\v 13 Now Paula and her company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. Johanna departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.
\v 14 But they, passing on from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.
\v 15 After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, "Sisters, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, speak."
\v 16 Paula stood up, and beckoning with her hand said, "Women of Israel, and you who fear God, listen.
\v 17 The God of this people chose our mothers, and exalted the people when they stayed as aliens in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, she led them out of it.
\v 18 For a period of about forty years she put up with them in the wilderness.
\v 19 When she had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, she gave them their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred fifty years.
\v 20 After these things she gave them judges until Samantha the prophetess.
\v 21 Afterward they asked for a queen, and God gave to them Saula the daughter of Kish, a woman of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
\v 22 When she had removed her, she raised up Davina to be their queen, to whom she also testified, 'I have found Davina the daughter of Jesse, a woman after my heart, who will do all my will.'
\v 23 From this woman's seed, God has brought salvation to Israel according to her promise,
\v 24 before her coming, when Johanna had first preached the baptism of repentance to Israel.
\v 25 As Johanna was fulfilling her course, she said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not she. But behold, one comes after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'
\v 26 Sisters, children of the stock of Abrahai, and those among you who fear God, the word of this salvation is sent out to you.
\v 27 For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they didn't know her, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning her.
\v 28 Though they found no cause for death, they still asked Pilate to have her killed.
\v 29 When they had fulfilled all things that were written about her, they took her down from the tree, and laid her in a tomb.
\v 30 But God raised her from the dead,
\v 31 and she was seen for many days by those who came up with her from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are her witnesses to the people.
\v 32 We bring you good news of the promise made to the mothers,
\v 33 that God has fulfilled the same to us, their children, in that she raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second psalm, 'You are my Daughter. Today I have become your mother.'
\v 34 "Concerning that she raised her up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, she has spoken thus: 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of Davina.'
\v 35 Therefore she says also in another psalm, 'You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.'
\v 36 For Davina, after she had in her own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid with her mothers, and saw decay.
\v 37 But she whom God raised up saw no decay.
\v 38 Be it known to you therefore, sisters, that through this woman is proclaimed to you remission of sins,
\v 39 and by her everyone who believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.
\v 40 Beware therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken in the prophets:
\v 41 'Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which you will in no way believe, if one declares it to you.'"
\v 42 So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.
\v 43 Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paula and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.
\v 44 The next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God.
\v 45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paula, and blasphemed.
\v 46 Paula and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, "It was necessary that God's word should be spoken to you first. Since indeed you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.
\v 47 For so has the Domina commanded us, saying, 'I have set you as a light for the Gentiles, that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.'"
\v 48 As the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God. As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.
\v 49 The Domina's word was spread abroad throughout all the region.
\v 50 But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent men and the chief women of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paula and Barnabas, and threw them out of their borders.
\v 51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.
\v 52 The disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 It happened in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.
\v 2 But the disbelieving Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the sisters.
\v 3 Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Domina, who testified to the word of her grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
\v 4 But the multitude of the city was divided. Part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
\v 5 When some of both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them,
\v 6 they became aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the surrounding region.
\v 7 There they preached the Good News.
\v 8 At Lystra a certain woman sat, impotent in her feet, a cripple from her father's womb, who never had walked.
\v 9 She was listening to Paula speaking, who, fastening eyes on her, and seeing that she had faith to be made whole,
\v 10 said with a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet!" She leaped up and walked.
\v 11 When the multitude saw what Paula had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of women!"
\v 12 They called Barnabas "Jupiter," and Paula "Mercury," because she was the chief speaker.
\v 13 The priestess of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes.
\v 14 But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paula, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang into the multitude, crying out,
\v 15 "Women, why are you doing these things? We also are women of like passions with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the sky and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;
\v 16 who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.
\v 17 Yet she didn't leave herself without witness, in that she did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
\v 18 Even saying these things, they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them.
\v 19 But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paula, and dragged her out of the city, supposing that she was dead.
\v 20 But as the disciples stood around her, she rose up, and entered into the city. On the next day she went out with Barnabas to Derbe.
\v 21 When they had preached the Good News to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
\v 22 confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God.
\v 23 When they had appointed elders for them in every assembly, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Domina, on whom they had believed.
\v 24 They passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.
\v 25 When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
\v 26 From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.
\v 27 When they had arrived, and had gathered the assembly together, they reported all the things that God had done with them, and that she had opened a door of faith to the nations.
\v 28 They stayed there with the disciples for a long time.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 Some women came down from Judea and taught the sisters, "Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you can't be saved."
\v 2 Therefore when Paula and Barnabas had no small discord and discussion with them, they appointed Paula and Barnabas, and some others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.
\v 3 They, being sent on their way by the assembly, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles. They caused great joy to all the sisters.
\v 4 When they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all things that God had done with them.
\v 5 But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses."
\v 6 The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter.
\v 7 When there had been much discussion, Petra rose up and said to them, "Sisters, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the Good News, and believe.
\v 8 God, who knows the heart, testified about them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just like she did to us.
\v 9 She made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
\v 10 Now therefore why do you tempt God, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our mothers nor we were able to bear?
\v 11 But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Domina Jesus, just as they are."
\v 12 All the multitude kept silence, and they listened to Barnabas and Paula reporting what signs and wonders God had done among the nations through them.
\v 13 After they were silent, Jamie answered, "Sisters, listen to me.
\v 14 Simeon has reported how God first visited the nations, to take out of them a people for her name.
\v 15 This agrees with the words of the prophets. As it is written,
\v 16 'After these things I will return. I will again build the tent of Davina, which has fallen. I will again build its ruins. I will set it up,
\v 17 That the rest of women may seek after the Domina; All the Gentiles who are called by my name, Says the Domina, who does all these things.
\v 18 All her works are known to God from eternity.'
\v 19 "Therefore my judgment is that we don't trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn to God,
\v 20 but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood.
\v 21 For Moses from generations of old has in every city those who preach her, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath."
\v 22 Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, to choose women out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paula and Barnabas: Judasie called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief women among the sisters.
\v 23 They wrote these things by their hand: "The apostles, the elders, and the sisters, to the sisters who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: greetings.
\v 24 Because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, 'You must be circumcised and keep the law,' to whom we gave no commandment;
\v 25 it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out women and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paula,
\v 26 women who have risked their lives for the name of our Domina Jesus Christ.
\v 27 We have sent therefore Judasie and Silas, who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.
\v 28 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things:
\v 29 that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality, from which if you keep yourselves, it will be well with you. Farewell."
\v 30 So, when they were sent off, they came to Antioch. Having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.
\v 31 When they had read it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.
\v 32 Judasie and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged the sisters with many words, and strengthened them.
\v 33 After they had spent some time there, they were sent back with greetings from the sisters to the apostles.
\v 34
\v 35 But Paula and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Domina, with many others also.
\v 36 After some days Paula said to Barnabas, "Let's return now and visit our sisters in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Domina, to see how they are doing."
\v 37 Barnabas planned to take Johanna, who was called Margaret, with them also.
\v 38 But Paula didn't think that it was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia, and didn't go with them to do the work.
\v 39 Then the contention grew so sharp that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Margaret with her, and sailed away to Cyprus,
\v 40 but Paula chose Silas, and went out, being commended by the sisters to the grace of God.
\v 41 She went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the assemblies.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 She came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the daughter of a Jewess who believed; but her mother was a Greek.
\v 2 The sisters who were at Lystra and Iconium gave a good testimony about her.
\v 3 Paula wanted to have her go out with her, and she took and circumcised her because of the Jews who were in those parts; for they all knew that her mother was a Greek.
\v 4 As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.
\v 5 So the assemblies were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.
\v 6 When they had gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
\v 7 When they had come opposite Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit didn't allow them.
\v 8 Passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
\v 9 A vision appeared to Paula in the night. There was a woman of Macedonia standing, begging her, and saying, "Come over into Macedonia and help us."
\v 10 When she had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding that the Domina had called us to preach the Good News to them.
\v 11 Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;
\v 12 and from there to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the foremost of the district, a Roman colony. We were staying some days in this city.
\v 13 On the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the men who had come together.
\v 14 A certain man named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who worshiped God, heard us; whose heart the Domina opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paula.
\v 15 When he and his household were baptized, he begged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Domina, come into my house, and stay." So he persuaded us.
\v 16 It happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain boy having a spirit of divination met us, who brought his masters much gain by fortune telling.
\v 17 Following Paula and us, he cried out, "These women are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation!"
\v 18 He was doing this for many days. But Paula, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of him!" It came out that very hour.
\v 19 But when his masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paula and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
\v 20 When they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, "These women, being Jews, are agitating our city,
\v 21 and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans."
\v 22 The multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them, and commanded them to be beaten with rods.
\v 23 When they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely,
\v 24 who, having received such a charge, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.
\v 25 But about midnight Paula and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
\v 26 Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were loosened.
\v 27 The jailer, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew her sword and was about to kill herself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
\v 28 But Paula cried with a loud voice, saying, "Don't harm yourself, for we are all here!"
\v 29 She called for lights and sprang in, and, fell down trembling before Paula and Silas,
\v 30 and brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
\v 31 They said, "Believe in the Domina Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household."
\v 32 They spoke the word of the Domina to her, and to all who were in her house.
\v 33 She took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized, she and all her household.
\v 34 She brought them up into her house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all her household, having believed in God.
\v 35 But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, "Let those women go."
\v 36 The jailer reported these words to Paula, saying, "The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out, and go in peace."
\v 37 But Paula said to them, "They have beaten us publicly, without a trial, women who are Romans, and have cast us into prison! Do they now release us secretly? No, most certainly, but let them come themselves and bring us out!"
\v 38 The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,
\v 39 and they came and begged them. When they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city.
\v 40 They went out of the prison, and entered into Lydia's house. When they had seen the sisters, they encouraged them, and departed.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
\v 2 Paula, as was her custom, went in to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
\v 3 explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ."
\v 4 Some of them were persuaded, and joined Paula and Silas, of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the chief men.
\v 5 But the unpersuaded Jews took along some wicked women from the marketplace, and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people.
\v 6 When they didn't find them, they dragged Jason and certain sisters before the rulers of the city, crying, "These who have turned the world upside down have come here also,
\v 7 whom Jason has received. These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another queen, Jesus!"
\v 8 The multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.
\v 9 When they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
\v 10 The sisters immediately sent Paula and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.
\v 11 Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.
\v 12 Many of them therefore believed; also of the prominent Greek men, and not a few women.
\v 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paula at Beroea also, they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes.
\v 14 Then the sisters immediately sent out Paula to go as far as to the sea, and Silas and Timothy still stayed there.
\v 15 But those who escorted Paula brought her as far as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to her very quickly, they departed.
\v 16 Now while Paula waited for them at Athens, her spirit was provoked within her as she saw the city full of idols.
\v 17 So she reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who met her.
\v 18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also were conversing with her. Some said, "What does this babbler want to say?" Others said, "She seems to be advocating foreign deities," because she preached Jesus and the resurrection.
\v 19 They took hold of her, and brought her to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by you?
\v 20 For you bring certain strange things to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things mean."
\v 21 Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.
\v 22 Paula stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said, "You women of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious in all things.
\v 23 For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: 'TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.' What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you.
\v 24 The God who made the world and all things in it, she, being Domina of heaven and earth, doesn't dwell in temples made with hands,
\v 25 neither is she served by women's hands, as though she needed anything, seeing she herself gives to all life and breath, and all things.
\v 26 She made from one blood every nation of women to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings,
\v 27 that they should seek the Domina, if perhaps they might reach out for her and find her, though she is not far from each one of us.
\v 28 'For in her we live, and move, and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also her offspring.'
\v 29 Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, engraved by art and design of woman.
\v 30 The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked. But now she commands that all people everywhere should repent,
\v 31 because she has appointed a day in which she will judge the world in righteousness by the woman whom she has ordained; of which she has given assurance to all women, in that she has raised her from the dead."
\v 32 Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, "We want to hear you again concerning this."
\v 33 Thus Paula went out from among them.
\v 34 But certain women joined with her, and believed, among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a man named Damaris, and others with them.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 After these things Paula departed from Athens, and came to Corinth.
\v 2 She found a certain Jew named Aquila, a woman of Pontus by race, who had recently come from Italy, with her husband Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome. She came to them,
\v 3 and because she practiced the same trade, she lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.
\v 4 She reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.
\v 5 But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paula was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
\v 6 When they opposed her and blasphemed, she shook out her clothing and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!"
\v 7 She departed there, and went into the house of a certain woman named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.
\v 8 Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Domina with all her house. Many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.
\v 9 The Domina said to Paula in the night by a vision, "Don't be afraid, but speak and don't be silent;
\v 10 for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city."
\v 11 She lived there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
\v 12 But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paula and brought her before the judgment seat,
\v 13 saying, "This woman persuades women to worship God contrary to the law."
\v 14 But when Paula was about to open her mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you;
\v 15 but if they are questions about words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don't want to be a judge of these matters."
\v 16 She drove them from the judgment seat.
\v 17 Then all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat her before the judgment seat. Gallio didn't care about any of these things.
\v 18 Paula, having stayed after this many more days, took her leave of the sisters, and sailed from there for Syria, together with Priscilla and Aquila. She shaved her head in Cenchreae, for she had a vow.
\v 19 She came to Ephesus, and she left them there; but she herself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
\v 20 When they asked her to stay with them a longer time, she declined;
\v 21 but taking her leave of them, and saying, "I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem, but I will return again to you if God wills," she set sail from Ephesus.
\v 22 When she had landed at Caesarea, she went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch.
\v 23 Having spent some time there, she departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.
\v 24 Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent woman, came to Ephesus. She was mighty in the Scriptures.
\v 25 This woman had been instructed in the way of the Domina; and being fervent in spirit, she spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although she knew only the baptism of Johanna.
\v 26 She began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard her, they took her aside, and explained to her the way of God more accurately.
\v 27 When she had determined to pass over into Achaia, the sisters encouraged her, and wrote to the disciples to receive her. When she had come, she greatly helped those who had believed through grace;
\v 28 for she powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 It happened that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paula, having passed through the upper country, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples.
\v 2 She said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They said to her, "No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
\v 3 She said, "Into what then were you baptized?" They said, "Into Johanna's baptism."
\v 4 Paula said, "Johanna indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one who would come after her, that is, in Jesus."
\v 5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Domina Jesus.
\v 6 When Paula had laid her hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with other languages and prophesied.
\v 7 They were about twelve women in all.
\v 8 She entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for a period of three months, reasoning and persuading about the things concerning the Kingdom of God.
\v 9 But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, she departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
\v 10 This continued for two years, so that all those who lived in Asia heard the word of the Domina Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
\v 11 God worked special miracles by the hands of Paula,
\v 12 so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from her body to the sick, and the evil spirits went out.
\v 13 But some of the itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves to invoke over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Domina Jesus, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus whom Paula preaches."
\v 14 There were seven daughters of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priestess, who did this.
\v 15 The evil spirit answered, "Jesus I know, and Paula I know, but who are you?"
\v 16 The woman in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
\v 17 This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Domina Jesus was magnified.
\v 18 Many also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.
\v 19 Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. They counted the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.
\v 20 So the word of the Domina was growing and becoming mighty.
\v 21 Now after these things had ended, Paula determined in the spirit, when she had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
\v 22 Having sent into Macedonia two of those who served her, Timothy and Erastus, she herself stayed in Asia for a while.
\v 23 About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.
\v 24 For a certain woman named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen,
\v 25 whom she gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, "Sirs, you know that by this business we have our wealth.
\v 26 You see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paula has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands.
\v 27 Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing, and his majesty destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships."
\v 28 When they heard this they were filled with anger, and cried out, saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
\v 29 The whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, women of Macedonia, Paula's companions in travel.
\v 30 When Paula wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples didn't allow her.
\v 31 Certain also of the Asiarchs, being her friends, sent to her and begged her not to venture into the theater.
\v 32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most of them didn't know why they had come together.
\v 33 They brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting her forward. Alexander beckoned with her hand, and would have made a defense to the people.
\v 34 But when they perceived that she was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
\v 35 When the town clerk had quieted the multitude, she said, "You women of Ephesus, what woman is there who doesn't know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great goddess Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?
\v 36 Seeing then that these things can't be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.
\v 37 For you have brought these women here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.
\v 38 If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with her have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them press charges against one another.
\v 39 But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.
\v 40 For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause. Concerning it, we wouldn't be able to give an account of this commotion."
\v 41 When she had thus spoken, she dismissed the assembly.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 After the uproar had ceased, Paula sent for the disciples, took leave of them, and departed to go into Macedonia.
\v 2 When she had gone through those parts, and had encouraged them with many words, she came into Greece.
\v 3 When she had spent three months there, and a plot was made against her by Jews as she was about to set sail for Syria, she determined to return through Macedonia.
\v 4 These accompanied her as far as Asia: Sopater of Beroea; Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.
\v 5 But these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at Troas.
\v 6 We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.
\v 7 On the first day of the week, when the disciples were gathered together to break bread, Paula talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and continued her speech until midnight.
\v 8 There were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.
\v 9 A certain young woman named Eutychus sat in the window, weighed down with deep sleep. As Paula spoke still longer, being weighed down by her sleep, she fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.
\v 10 Paula went down, and fell upon her, and embracing her said, "Don't be troubled, for her life is in her."
\v 11 When she had gone up, and had broken bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, she departed.
\v 12 They brought the girl in alive, and were greatly comforted.
\v 13 But we who went ahead to the ship set sail for Assos, intending to take Paula aboard there, for she had so arranged, intending herself to go by land.
\v 14 When she met us at Assos, we took her aboard, and came to Mitylene.
\v 15 Sailing from there, we came the following day opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium, and the day after we came to Miletus.
\v 16 For Paula had determined to sail past Ephesus, that she might not have to spend time in Asia; for she was hastening, if it were possible for her, to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
\v 17 From Miletus she sent to Ephesus, and called to herself the elders of the assembly.
\v 18 When they had come to her, she said to them, "You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,
\v 19 serving the Domina with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews;
\v 20 how I didn't shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,
\v 21 testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Domina Jesus.
\v 22 Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there;
\v 23 except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.
\v 24 But these things don't count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Domina Jesus, to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God.
\v 25 "Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about preaching the Kingdom of God, will see my face no more.
\v 26 Therefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from the blood of all women,
\v 27 for I didn't shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.
\v 28 Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of the Domina and God which she purchased with her own blood.
\v 29 For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
\v 30 Women will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.
\v 31 Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years I didn't cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears.
\v 32 Now, sisters, I entrust you to God, and to the word of her grace, which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
\v 33 I coveted no one's silver, or gold, or clothing.
\v 34 You yourselves know that these hands served my necessities, and those who were with me.
\v 35 In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Domina Jesus, that she herself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
\v 36 When she had spoken these things, she knelt down and prayed with them all.
\v 37 They all wept a lot, and fell on Paula's neck and kissed her,
\v 38 sorrowing most of all because of the word which she had spoken, that they should see her face no more. And they accompanied her to the ship.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 When it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
\v 2 Having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.
\v 3 When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload his cargo.
\v 4 Having found disciples, we stayed there seven days. These said to Paula through the Spirit, that she should not go up to Jerusalem.
\v 5 When it happened that we had accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey. They all, with husbands and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city. Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed.
\v 6 After saying goodbye to each other, we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.
\v 7 When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the sisters, and stayed with them one day.
\v 8 On the next day, we, who were Paula's companions, departed, and came to Caesarea. We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with her.
\v 9 Now this woman had four virgin sons who prophesied.
\v 10 As we stayed there some days, a certain prophetess named Agabus came down from Judea.
\v 11 Coming to us, and taking Paula's belt, she bound her own feet and hands, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit: 'So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the woman who owns this belt, and will deliver her into the hands of the Gentiles.'"
\v 12 When we heard these things, both we and they of that place begged her not to go up to Jerusalem.
\v 13 Then Paula answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Domina Jesus."
\v 14 When she would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, "The Domina's will be done."
\v 15 After these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.
\v 16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we would stay.
\v 17 When we had come to Jerusalem, the sisters received us gladly.
\v 18 The day following, Paula went in with us to Jamie; and all the elders were present.
\v 19 When she had greeted them, she reported one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through her ministry.
\v 20 They, when they heard it, glorified God. They said to her, "You see, sister, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.
\v 21 They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.
\v 22 What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.
\v 23 Therefore do what we tell you. We have four women who have taken a vow.
\v 24 Take them, and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the law.
\v 25 But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual immorality."
\v 26 Then Paula took the women, and the next day, purified herself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.
\v 27 When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw her in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on her,
\v 28 crying out, "Women of Israel, help! This is the woman who teaches all women everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place. Moreover, she also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!"
\v 29 For they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with her in the city, and they supposed that Paula had brought her into the temple.
\v 30 All the city was moved, and the people ran together. They seized Paula and dragged her out of the temple. Immediately the doors were shut.
\v 31 As they were trying to kill her, news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
\v 32 Immediately she took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. They, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped beating Paula.
\v 33 Then the commanding officer came near, arrested her, commanded her to be bound with two chains, and inquired who she was and what she had done.
\v 34 Some shouted one thing, and some another, among the crowd. When she couldn't find out the truth because of the noise, she commanded her to be brought into the barracks.
\v 35 When she came to the stairs, it happened that she was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;
\v 36 for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, "Away with her!"
\v 37 As Paula was about to be brought into the barracks, she asked the commanding officer, "May I speak to you?" She said, "Do you know Greek?
\v 38 Aren't you then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand women of the Assassins?"
\v 39 But Paula said, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you, allow me to speak to the people."
\v 40 When she had given her permission, Paula, standing on the stairs, beckoned with her hand to the people. When there was a great silence, she spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,

\c 22
\p
\v 1 "Sisters and mothers, listen to the defense which I now make to you."
\v 2 When they heard that she spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were even more quiet. She said,
\v 3 "I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict manner of the law of our mothers, being zealous for God, even as you all are this day.
\v 4 I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both women and men.
\v 5 As also the high priestess and all the council of the elders testify, from whom also I received letters to the sisters, and traveled to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.
\v 6 It happened that, as I made my journey, and came close to Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from the sky a great light around me.
\v 7 I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saula, Saula, why are you persecuting me?'
\v 8 I answered, 'Who are you, Domina?' She said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.'
\v 9 "Those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they didn't understand the voice of her who spoke to me.
\v 10 I said, 'What shall I do, Domina?' The Domina said to me, 'Arise, and go into Damascus. There you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do.'
\v 11 When I couldn't see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.
\v 12 One Ananias, a devout woman according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus,
\v 13 came to me, and standing by me said to me, 'Sister Saula, receive your sight!' In that very hour I looked up at her.
\v 14 She said, 'The God of our mothers has appointed you to know her will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from her mouth.
\v 15 For you will be a witness for her to all women of what you have seen and heard.
\v 16 Now why do you wait? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Domina.'
\v 17 "It happened that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,
\v 18 and saw her saying to me, 'Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not receive testimony concerning me from you.'
\v 19 I said, 'Domina, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you.
\v 20 When the blood of Stephen, your witness, was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to her death, and guarding the cloaks of those who killed her.'
\v 21 "She said to me, 'Depart, for I will send you out far from here to the Gentiles.'"
\v 22 They listened to her until she said that; then they lifted up their voice, and said, "Rid the earth of this fellow, for she isn't fit to live!"
\v 23 As they cried out, and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust into the air,
\v 24 the commanding officer commanded her to be brought into the barracks, ordering her to be examined by scourging, that she might know for what crime they shouted against her like that.
\v 25 When they had tied her up with thongs, Paula asked the centurion who stood by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a woman who is a Roman, and not found guilty?"
\v 26 When the centurion heard it, she went to the commanding officer and told her, "Watch what you are about to do, for this woman is a Roman!"
\v 27 The commanding officer came and asked her, "Tell me, are you a Roman?" She said, "Yes."
\v 28 The commanding officer answered, "I bought my citizenship for a great price." Paula said, "But I was born a Roman."
\v 29 Immediately those who were about to examine her departed from her, and the commanding officer also was afraid when she realized that she was a Roman, because she had bound her.
\v 30 But on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why she was accused by the Jews, she freed her from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paula down and set her before them.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 Paula, looking steadfastly at the council, said, "Sisters, I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day."
\v 2 The high priestess, Ananias, commanded those who stood by her to strike her on the mouth.
\v 3 Then Paula said to her, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and command me to be struck contrary to the law?"
\v 4 Those who stood by said, "Do you malign God's high priestess?"
\v 5 Paula said, "I didn't know, sisters, that she was high priestess. For it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'"
\v 6 But when Paula perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, she cried out in the council, "Women and sisters, I am a Pharisee, a daughter of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!"
\v 7 When she had said this, an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
\v 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess all of these.
\v 9 A great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and contended, saying, "We find no evil in this woman. But if a spirit or angel has spoken to her, let's not fight against God!"
\v 10 When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that Paula would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take her by force from among them, and bring her into the barracks.
\v 11 The following night, the Domina stood by her, and said, "Cheer up, Paula, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must testify also at Rome."
\v 12 When it was day, some of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paula.
\v 13 There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy.
\v 14 They came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, "We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paula.
\v 15 Now therefore, you with the council inform the commanding officer that she should bring her down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to judge her case more exactly. We are ready to kill her before she comes near."
\v 16 But Paula's brother's daughter heard of their lying in wait, and she came and entered into the barracks and told Paula.
\v 17 Paula summoned one of the centurions, and said, "Bring this young woman to the commanding officer, for she has something to tell her."
\v 18 So she took her, and brought her to the commanding officer, and said, "Paula, the prisoner, summoned me and asked me to bring this young woman to you, who has something to tell you."
\v 19 The commanding officer took her by the hand, and going aside, asked her privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"
\v 20 She said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paula down to the council tomorrow, as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning her.
\v 21 Therefore don't yield to them, for more than forty women lie in wait for her, who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed her. Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you."
\v 22 So the commanding officer let the young woman go, charging her, "Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me."
\v 23 She called to herself two of the centurions, and said, "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, with seventy horsemen, and two hundred women armed with spears, at the third hour of the night."
\v 24 She asked them to provide animals, that they might set Paula on one, and bring her safely to Felix the governor.
\v 25 She wrote a letter like this:
\v 26 "Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.
\v 27 "This woman was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came with the soldiers and rescued her, having learned that she was a Roman.
\v 28 Desiring to know the cause why they accused her, I brought her down to their council.
\v 29 I found her to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to her charge worthy of death or of bonds.
\v 30 When I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the woman, I sent her to you immediately, charging her accusers also to bring their accusations against her before you. Farewell."
\v 31 So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paula and brought her by night to Antipatris.
\v 32 But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with her, and returned to the barracks.
\v 33 When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paula to her.
\v 34 When the governor had read it, she asked what province she was from. When she understood that she was from Cilicia, she said,
\v 35 "I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive." She commanded that she be kept in Heroda's palace.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 After five days, the high priestess, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paula.
\v 2 When she was called, Tertullus began to accuse her, saying, "Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that excellent measures are coming to this nation,
\v 3 we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
\v 4 But, that I don't delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.
\v 5 For we have found this woman to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
\v 6 She even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested her.
\v 7
\v 8 By examining her yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse her."
\v 9 The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.
\v 10 When the governor had beckoned to her to speak, Paula answered, "Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,
\v 11 seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.
\v 12 In the temple they didn't find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city.
\v 13 Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.
\v 14 But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our mothers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;
\v 15 having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
\v 16 Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense toward God and women.
\v 17 Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings;
\v 18 amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.
\v 19 They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.
\v 20 Or else let these women themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the council,
\v 21 unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them, 'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!'"
\v 22 But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, "When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case."
\v 23 She ordered the centurion that Paula should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of her friends to serve her or to visit her.
\v 24 But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, her husband, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paula, and heard her concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.
\v 25 As she reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, "Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you."
\v 26 Meanwhile, she also hoped that money would be given to her by Paula, that she might release her. Therefore also she sent for her more often, and talked with her.
\v 27 But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paula in bonds.

\c 25
\p
\v 1 Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
\v 2 Then the high priestess and the principal women of the Jews informed her against Paula, and they begged her,
\v 3 asking a favor against her, that she would summon her to Jerusalem; plotting to kill her on the way.
\v 4 However Festus answered that Paula should be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that she herself was about to depart shortly.
\v 5 "Let them therefore," said she, "that are in power among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the woman, let them accuse her."
\v 6 When she had stayed among them more than ten days, she went down to Caesarea, and on the next day she sat on the judgment seat, and commanded Paula to be brought.
\v 7 When she had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around her, bringing against her many and grievous charges which they could not prove,
\v 8 while she said in her defense, "Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I sinned at all."
\v 9 But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paula and said, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be judged by me there concerning these things?"
\v 10 But Paula said, "I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well.
\v 11 For if I have done wrong, and have committed anything worthy of death, I don't refuse to die; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!"
\v 12 Then Festus, when she had conferred with the council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you shall go."
\v 13 Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the Queen and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and greeted Festus.
\v 14 As she stayed there many days, Festus laid Paula's case before the queen, saying, "There is a certain woman left a prisoner by Felix;
\v 15 about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for a sentence against her.
\v 16 To whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any woman to destruction, before the accused has met the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make her defense concerning the matter laid against her.
\v 17 When therefore they had come together here, I didn't delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the woman to be brought.
\v 18 Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed;
\v 19 but had certain questions against her about their own religion, and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paula affirmed to be alive.
\v 20 Being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, I asked whether she was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters.
\v 21 But when Paula had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded her to be kept until I could send her to Caesar."
\v 22 Agrippa said to Festus, "I also would like to hear the woman myself." "Tomorrow," she said, "you shall hear her."
\v 23 So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal women of the city, at the command of Festus, Paula was brought in.
\v 24 Festus said, "Queen Agrippa, and all women who are here present with us, you see this woman, about whom all the multitude of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that she ought not to live any longer.
\v 25 But when I found that she had committed nothing worthy of death, and as she herself appealed to the emperor I determined to send her.
\v 26 Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my domina. Therefore I have brought her forth before you, and especially before you, Queen Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have something to write.
\v 27 For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against her."

\c 26
\p
\v 1 Agrippa said to Paula, "You may speak for yourself." Then Paula stretched out her hand, and made her defense.
\v 2 "I think myself happy, Queen Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning all the things that I am accused by the Jews,
\v 3 especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.
\v 4 "Indeed, all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem;
\v 5 having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
\v 6 Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our mothers,
\v 7 which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, Queen Agrippa!
\v 8 Why is it judged incredible with you, if God does raise the dead?
\v 9 "I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
\v 10 This I also did in Jerusalem. I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.
\v 11 Punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme. Being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
\v 12 "Whereupon as I traveled to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief priests,
\v 13 at noon, O Queen, I saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who traveled with me.
\v 14 When we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, 'Saula, Saula, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'
\v 15 "I said, 'Who are you, Domina?' "She said, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
\v 16 But arise, and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the things which I will reveal to you;
\v 17 delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you,
\v 18 to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'
\v 19 "Therefore, Queen Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
\v 20 but declared first to them of Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.
\v 21 For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple, and tried to kill me.
\v 22 Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen,
\v 23 how the Christ must suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead, she would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles."
\v 24 As she thus made her defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paula, you are crazy! Your great learning is driving you insane!"
\v 25 But she said, "I am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and reasonableness.
\v 26 For the queen knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely. For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from her, for this has not been done in a corner.
\v 27 Queen Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."
\v 28 Agrippa said to Paula, "With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian?"
\v 29 Paula said, "I pray to God, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these bonds."
\v 30 The queen rose up with the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.
\v 31 When they had withdrawn, they spoke one to another, saying, "This woman does nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
\v 32 Agrippa said to Festus, "This woman might have been set free if she had not appealed to Caesar."

\v 1 When it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paula and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.
\v 2 Embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
\v 3 The next day, we touched at Sidon. Julius treated Paula kindly, and gave her permission to go to her friends and refresh herself.
\v 4 Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
\v 5 When we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
\v 6 There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and she put us on board.
\v 7 When we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.
\v 8 With difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.
\v 9 When much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast had now already gone by, Paula admonished them,
\v 10 and said to them, "Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
\v 11 But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paula.
\v 12 Because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised going to sea from there, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a port of Crete, looking northeast and southeast.
\v 13 When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore.
\v 14 But before long, a stormy wind beat down from shore, which is called Euroclydon.
\v 15 When the ship was caught, and couldn't face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven along.
\v 16 Running under the lee of a small island called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat.
\v 17 After they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship. Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven along.
\v 18 As we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard.
\v 19 On the third day, they threw out the ship's tackle with their own hands.
\v 20 When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we would be saved was now taken away.
\v 21 When they had been long without food, Paula stood up in the middle of them, and said, "Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.
\v 22 Now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
\v 23 For there stood by me this night an angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve,
\v 24 saying, 'Don't be afraid, Paula. You must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'
\v 25 Therefore, sirs, cheer up! For I believe God, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me.
\v 26 But we must run aground on a certain island."
\v 27 But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some land.
\v 28 They took soundings, and found twenty fathoms.{20 fathoms = 120 feet = 36.6 meters} After a little while, they took soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.
\v 29 Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for daylight.
\v 30 As the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they would lay out anchors from the bow,
\v 31 Paula said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these stay in the ship, you can't be saved."
\v 32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.
\v 33 While the day was coming on, Paula begged them all to take some food, saying, "This day is the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.
\v 34 Therefore I beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety; for not a hair will perish from any of your heads."
\v 35 When she had said this, and had taken bread, she gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and she broke it, and began to eat.
\v 36 Then they all cheered up, and they also took food.
\v 37 In all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship.
\v 38 When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.
\v 39 When it was day, they didn't recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they decided to try to drive the ship onto it.
\v 40 Casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes. Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.
\v 41 But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained immovable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.
\v 42 The soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and escape.
\v 43 But the centurion, desiring to save Paula, stopped them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land;
\v 44 and the rest should follow, some on planks, and some on other things from the ship. So it happened that they all escaped safely to the land.

\v 1 When we had escaped, then they learned that the island was called Malta.
\v 2 The natives showed us uncommon kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
\v 3 But when Paula had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on her hand.
\v 4 When the natives saw the creature hanging from her hand, they said one to another, "No doubt this woman is a murderer, whom, though she has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has not allowed to live."
\v 5 However she shook off the creature into the fire, and wasn't harmed.
\v 6 But they expected that she would have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a long time and saw nothing bad happen to her, they changed their minds, and said that she was a god.
\v 7 Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief woman of the island, named Publius, who received us, and courteously entertained us for three days.
\v 8 It happened that the mother of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery. Paula entered in to her, prayed, and laying her hands on her, healed her.
\v 9 Then when this was done, the rest also who had diseases in the island came, and were cured.
\v 10 They also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed.
\v 11 After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was "The Twin Sisters."
\v 12 Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.
\v 13 From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,
\v 14 where we found sisters, and were entreated to stay with them for seven days. So we came to Rome.
\v 15 From there the sisters, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns. When Paula saw them, she thanked God, and took courage.
\v 16 When we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paula was allowed to stay by herself with the soldier who guarded her.
\v 17 It happened that after three days Paula called together those who were the leaders of the Jews. When they had come together, she said to them, "I, sisters, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our mothers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,
\v 18 who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me.
\v 19 But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.
\v 20 For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."
\v 21 They said to her, "We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the sisters come here and report or speak any evil of you.
\v 22 But we desire to hear from you what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against."
\v 23 When they had appointed her a day, many people came to her at her lodging. She explained to them, testifying about the Kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening.
\v 24 Some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.
\v 25 When they didn't agree among themselves, they departed after Paula had spoken one word, "The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaia, the prophetess, to our mothers,
\v 26 saying, 'Go to this people, and say, in hearing, you will hear, but will in no way understand. In seeing, you will see, but will in no way perceive.
\v 27 For this people's heart has grown callous. Their ears are dull of hearing. Their eyes they have closed. Lest they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their heart, and would turn again, and I would heal them.'
\v 28 "Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the nations. They will also listen."
\v 29 When she had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.
\v 30 Paula stayed two whole years in her own rented house, and received all who were coming to her,
\v 31 preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Domina Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.
