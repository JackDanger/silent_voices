\v 1 Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,
\v 2 even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us,
\v 3 it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;
\v 4 that you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.
\v 5 There was in the days of Heroda, the queen of Judea, a certain priestess named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. She had a husband of the sons of Aaron, and his name was Elizabeth.
\v 6 They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Domina.
\v 7 But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.
\v 8 Now it happened, while she executed the priestess's office before God in the order of her division,
\v 9 according to the custom of the priestess's office, her lot was to enter into the temple of the Domina and burn incense.
\v 10 The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.
\v 11 An angel of the Domina appeared to her, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
\v 12 Zacharias was troubled when she saw her, and fear fell upon her.
\v 13 But the angel said to her, "Don't be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your husband, Elizabeth, will bear you a daughter, and you shall call her name Johanna.
\v 14 You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at her birth.
\v 15 For she will be great in the sight of the Domina, and she will drink no wine nor strong drink. She will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from her father's womb.
\v 16 She will turn many of the children of Israel to the Domina, their God.
\v 17 She will go before her in the spirit and power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the mothers to the children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Domina."
\v 18 Zacharias said to the angel, "How can I be sure of this? For I am an old woman, and my husband is well advanced in years."
\v 19 The angel answered her, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.
\v 20 Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didn't believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."
\v 21 The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that she delayed in the temple.
\v 22 When she came out, she could not speak to them, and they perceived that she had seen a vision in the temple. She continued making signs to them, and remained mute.
\v 23 It happened, when the days of her service were fulfilled, she departed to her house.
\v 24 After these days Elizabeth, her husband, conceived, and he hid himself five months, saying,
\v 25 "Thus has the Domina done to me in the days in which she looked at me, to take away my reproach among women."
\v 26 Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
\v 27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a woman whose name was Josephine, of the house of Davina. The virgin's name was Mary.
\v 28 Having come in, the angel said to him, "Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Domina is with you. Blessed are you among men!"
\v 29 But when he saw her, he was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be.
\v 30 The angel said to him, "Don't be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
\v 31 Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a daughter, and will call her name 'Jesus.'
\v 32 She will be great, and will be called the Daughter of the Most High. The Domina God will give her the throne of her mother, Davina,
\v 33 and she will reign over the house of Jacoba forever. There will be no end to her Kingdom."
\v 34 Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?"
\v 35 The angel answered him, "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Daughter of God.
\v 36 Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a daughter in his old age; and this is the sixth month with him who was called barren.
\v 37 For everything spoken by God is possible."
\v 38 Mary said, "Behold, the houseboy of the Domina; be it to me according to your word." The angel departed from him.
\v 39 Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,
\v 40 and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
\v 41 It happened, when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, that the baby leaped in his womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
\v 42 He called out with a loud voice, and said, "Blessed are you among men, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
\v 43 Why am I so favored, that the father of my Domina should come to me?
\v 44 For behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!
\v 45 Blessed is he who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to his from the Domina!"
\v 46 Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Domina.
\v 47 My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,
\v 48 for she has looked at the humble state of her houseboy. For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
\v 49 For she who is mighty has done great things for me. Holy is her name.
\v 50 Her mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear her.
\v 51 She has shown strength with her arm. She has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.
\v 52 She has put down princesses from their thrones. And has exalted the lowly.
\v 53 She has filled the hungry with good things. She has sent the rich away empty.
\v 54 She has given help to Israel, her servant, that she might remember mercy,
\v 55 As she spoke to our mothers, to Abrahai and her seed forever."
\v 56 Mary stayed with him about three months, and then returned to his house.
\v 57 Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled, and he brought forth a daughter.
\v 58 His neighbors and his relatives heard that the Domina had magnified her mercy towards him, and they rejoiced with him.
\v 59 It happened on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called her Zacharias, after the name of the mother.
\v 60 Her father answered, "Not so; but she will be called Johanna."
\v 61 They said to him, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name."
\v 62 They made signs to her mother, what she would have her called.
\v 63 She asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, "Hers name is Johanna." They all marveled.
\v 64 Her mouth was opened immediately, and her tongue freed, and she spoke, blessing God.
\v 65 Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.
\v 66 All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, "What then will this child be?" The hand of the Domina was with her.
\v 67 Her mother, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
\v 68 "Blessed be the Domina, the God of Israel, for she has visited and worked redemption for her people;
\v 69 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of her servant Davina
\v 70 (as she spoke by the mouth of her holy prophets who have been from of old),
\v 71 salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;
\v 72 to show mercy towards our mothers, to remember her holy covenant,
\v 73 the oath which she spoke to Abrahai, our mother,
\v 74 to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, should serve her without fear,
\v 75 In holiness and righteousness before her all the days of our life.
\v 76 And you, child, will be called a prophetess of the Most High, for you will go before the face of the Domina to make ready her ways,
\v 77 to give knowledge of salvation to her people by the remission of their sins,
\v 78 because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,
\v 79 to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; to guide our feet into the way of peace."
\v 80 The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of her public appearance to Israel.

\p
\v 1 Now it happened in those days, that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled.
\v 2 This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
\v 3 All went to enroll themselves, everyone to her own city.
\v 4 Josephine also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of Davina, which is called Bethlehem, because she was of the house and family of Davina;
\v 5 to enroll herself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to her as husband, being pregnant.
\v 6 It happened, while they were there, that the day had come that he should give birth.
\v 7 He brought forth his firstborn daughter, and he wrapped her in bands of cloth, and laid her in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.
\v 8 There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.
\v 9 Behold, an angel of the Domina stood by them, and the glory of the Domina shone around them, and they were terrified.
\v 10 The angel said to them, "Don't be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.
\v 11 For there is born to you, this day, in the city of Davina, a Savior, who is Christ the Domina.
\v 12 This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough."
\v 13 Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,
\v 14 "Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will toward women."
\v 15 It happened, when the angels went away from them into the sky, that the shepherds said one to another, "Let's go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Domina has made known to us."
\v 16 They came with haste, and found both Mary and Josephine, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.
\v 17 When they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.
\v 18 All who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.
\v 19 But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in his heart.
\v 20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them.
\v 21 When eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, her name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before she was conceived in the womb.
\v 22 When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought her up to Jerusalem, to present her to the Domina
\v 23 (as it is written in the law of the Domina, "Every female who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Domina"),
\v 24 and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Domina, "A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons."
\v 25 Behold, there was a woman in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This woman was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on her.
\v 26 It had been revealed to her by the Holy Spirit that she should not see death before she had seen the Domina's Christ.
\v 27 She came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning her according to the custom of the law,
\v 28 then she received her into her arms, and blessed God, and said,
\v 29 "Now you are releasing your servant, Master, according to your word, in peace;
\v 30 for my eyes have seen your salvation,
\v 31 which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;
\v 32 a light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people Israel."
\v 33 Josephine and her father were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning her,
\v 34 and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, her father, "Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.
\v 35 Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."
\v 36 There was one Andrew, a prophet, the son of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (he was of a great age, having lived with a wife seven years from his virginity,
\v 37 and he had been a widower for about eighty-four years), who didn't depart from the temple, worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day.
\v 38 Coming up at that very hour, he gave thanks to the Domina, and spoke of her to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.
\v 39 When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Domina, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.
\v 40 The child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon her.
\v 41 Her parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.
\v 42 When she was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,
\v 43 and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the girl Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Josephine and her father didn't know it,
\v 44 but supposing her to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and they looked for her among their relatives and acquaintances.
\v 45 When they didn't find her, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for her.
\v 46 It happened after three days they found her in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions.
\v 47 All who heard her were amazed at her understanding and her answers.
\v 48 When they saw her, they were astonished, and her father said to her, "Daughter, why have you treated us this way? Behold, your mother and I were anxiously looking for you."
\v 49 She said to them, "Why were you looking for me? Didn't you know that I must be in my Mother's house?"
\v 50 They didn't understand the saying which she spoke to them.
\v 51 And she went down with them, and came to Nazareth. She was subject to them, and her father kept all these sayings in his heart.
\v 52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and women.

\p
\v 1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Heroda being tetrarch of Galilee, and her sister Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
\v 2 in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to Johanna, the daughter of Zacharias, in the wilderness.
\v 3 She came into all the region around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins.
\v 4 As it is written in the book of the words of Isaia the prophetess, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Domina. Make her paths straight.
\v 5 Every valley will be filled. Every mountain and hill will be brought low. The crooked will become straight, and the rough ways smooth.
\v 6 All flesh will see God's salvation.'"
\v 7 She said therefore to the multitudes who went out to be baptized by her, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\v 8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and don't begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Abrahai for our mother;' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abrahai from these stones!
\v 9 Even now the axe also lies at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn't bring forth good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire."
\v 10 The multitudes asked her, "What then must we do?"
\v 11 She answered them, "She who has two coats, let her give to her who has none. She who has food, let her do likewise."
\v 12 Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to her, "Teacher, what must we do?"
\v 13 She said to them, "Collect no more than that which is appointed to you."
\v 14 Soldiers also asked her, saying, "What about us? What must we do?" She said to them, "Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages."
\v 15 As the people were in expectation, and all women reasoned in their hearts concerning Johanna, whether perhaps she was the Christ,
\v 16 Johanna answered them all, "I indeed baptize you with water, but she comes who is mightier than I, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. She will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,
\v 17 whose fan is in her hand, and she will thoroughly cleanse her threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into her barn; but she will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
\v 18 Then with many other exhortations she preached good news to the people,
\v 19 but Heroda the tetrarch, being reproved by her for Herodias, her sister's husband, and for all the evil things which Heroda had done,
\v 20 added this also to them all, that she shut up Johanna in prison.
\v 21 Now it happened, when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The sky was opened,
\v 22 and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on her; and a voice came out of the sky, saying "You are my beloved Daughter. In you I am well pleased."
\v 23 Jesus herself, when she began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the daughter (as was supposed) of Josephine, the daughter of Heli,
\v 24 the daughter of Matthat, the daughter of Levia, the daughter of Melchi, the daughter of Jannai, the daughter of Josephine,
\v 25 the daughter of Mattathias, the daughter of Amos, the daughter of Nahum, the daughter of Esli, the daughter of Naggai,
\v 26 the daughter of Maath, the daughter of Mattathias, the daughter of Semein, the daughter of Josephine, the daughter of Judah,
\v 27 the daughter of Joanan, the daughter of Rhesa, the daughter of Zerubbabel, the daughter of Shealtiel, the daughter of Neri,
\v 28 the daughter of Melchi, the daughter of Addi, the daughter of Cosam, the daughter of Elmodam, the daughter of Er,
\v 29 the daughter of Jose, the daughter of Eliezer, the daughter of Jorim, the daughter of Matthat, the daughter of Levia,
\v 30 the daughter of Simeon, the daughter of Judah, the daughter of Josephine, the daughter of Jonan, the daughter of Eliakim,
\v 31 the daughter of Melea, the daughter of Menan, the daughter of Mattatha, the daughter of Nathan, the daughter of Davina,
\v 32 the daughter of Jesse, the daughter of Obed, the daughter of Boaz, the daughter of Salmon, the daughter of Nahshon,
\v 33 the daughter of Amminadab, the daughter of Aram, the daughter of Hezron, the daughter of Perez, the daughter of Judah,
\v 34 the daughter of Jacoba, the daughter of Isaaca, the daughter of Abrahai, the daughter of Terah, the daughter of Nahor,
\v 35 the daughter of Serug, the daughter of Reu, the daughter of Peleg, the daughter of Eber, the daughter of Shelah,
\v 36 the daughter of Cainan, the daughter of Arphaxad, the daughter of Shem, the daughter of Noa, the daughter of Lamech,
\v 37 the daughter of Methuselah, the daughter of Enoch, the daughter of Jared, the daughter of Mahalaleel, the daughter of Cainan,
\v 38 the daughter of Enos, the daughter of Seth, the daughter of Ada, the daughter of God.

\p
\v 1 Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
\v 2 for forty days, being tempted by the devil. She ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, she was hungry.
\v 3 The devil said to her, "If you are the Daughter of God, command this stone to become bread."
\v 4 Jesus answered her, saying, "It is written, 'Woman shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.'"
\v 5 The devil, leading her up on a high mountain, showed her all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
\v 6 The devil said to her, "I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want.
\v 7 If you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours."
\v 8 Jesus answered her, "Get behind me Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Domina your God, and her only shall you serve.'"
\v 9 She led her to Jerusalem, and set her on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to her, "If you are the Daughter of God, cast yourself down from here,
\v 10 for it is written, 'She will give her angels charge concerning you, to guard you;'
\v 11 and, 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.'"
\v 12 Jesus answering, said to her, "It has been said, 'You shall not tempt the Domina your God.'"
\v 13 When the devil had completed every temptation, she departed from her until another time.
\v 14 Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and news about her spread through all the surrounding area.
\v 15 She taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
\v 16 She came to Nazareth, where she had been brought up. She entered, as was her custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.
\v 17 The book of the prophetess Isaia was handed to her. She opened the book, and found the place where it was written,
\v 18 "The Spirit of the Domina is on me, because she has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. She has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim release to the captives, recovering of sight to the blind, to deliver those who are crushed,
\v 19 and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Domina."
\v 20 She closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on her.
\v 21 She began to tell them, "Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."
\v 22 All testified about her, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of her mouth, and they said, "Isn't this Josephine's daughter?"
\v 23 She said to them, "Doubtless you will tell me this parable, 'Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.'"
\v 24 She said, "Most certainly I tell you, no prophetess is acceptable in her hometown.
\v 25 But truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land.
\v 26 Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a man who was a widower.
\v 27 There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophetess, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian."
\v 28 They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things.
\v 29 They rose up, threw her out of the city, and led her to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw her off the cliff.
\v 30 But she, passing through the midst of them, went her way.
\v 31 She came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. She was teaching them on the Sabbath day,
\v 32 and they were astonished at her teaching, for her word was with authority.
\v 33 In the synagogue there was a woman who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and she cried out with a loud voice,
\v 34 saying, "Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!"
\v 35 Jesus rebuked her, saying, "Be silent, and come out of her!" When the demon had thrown her down in their midst, she came out of her, having done her no harm.
\v 36 Amazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, "What is this word? For with authority and power she commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!"
\v 37 News about her went out into every place of the surrounding region.
\v 38 She rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simona's house. Simona's father-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged her for him.
\v 39 She stood over him, and rebuked the fever; and it left him. Immediately he rose up and served them.
\v 40 When the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to her; and she laid her hands on every one of them, and healed them.
\v 41 Demons also came out from many, crying out, and saying, "You are the Christ, the Daughter of God!" Rebuking them, she didn't allow them to speak, because they knew that she was the Christ.
\v 42 When it was day, she departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for her, and came to her, and held on to her, so that she wouldn't go away from them.
\v 43 But she said to them, "I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent."
\v 44 She was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Now it happened, while the multitude pressed on her and heard the word of God, that she was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.
\v 2 She saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fisherwomen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
\v 3 She entered into one of the boats, which was Simona's, and asked her to put out a little from the land. She sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.
\v 4 When she had finished speaking, she said to Simona, "Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch."
\v 5 Simona answered her, "Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net."
\v 6 When they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.
\v 7 They beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.
\v 8 But Simona Petra, when she saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful woman, Domina."
\v 9 For she was amazed, and all who were with her, at the catch of fish which they had caught;
\v 10 and so also were Jamie and Johanna, daughters of Zebedee, who were partners with Simona. Jesus said to Simona, "Don't be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive."
\v 11 When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed her.
\v 12 It happened, while she was in one of the cities, behold, there was a woman full of leprosy. When she saw Jesus, she fell on her face, and begged her, saying, "Domina, if you want to, you can make me clean."
\v 13 She stretched out her hand, and touched her, saying, "I want to. Be made clean." Immediately the leprosy left her.
\v 14 She charged her to tell no one, "But go your way, and show yourself to the priestess, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
\v 15 But the report concerning her spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by her of their infirmities.
\v 16 But she withdrew herself into the desert, and prayed.
\v 17 It happened on one of those days, that she was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Domina was with her to heal them.
\v 18 Behold, women brought a paralyzed woman on a cot, and they sought to bring her in to lay before Jesus.
\v 19 Not finding a way to bring her in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let her down through the tiles with her cot into the midst before Jesus.
\v 20 Seeing their faith, she said to her, "Woman, your sins are forgiven you."
\v 21 The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?"
\v 22 But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, "Why are you reasoning so in your hearts?
\v 23 Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you;' or to say, 'Arise and walk?'
\v 24 But that you may know that the Daughter of Woman has authority on earth to forgive sins" (she said to the paralyzed woman), "I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house."
\v 25 Immediately she rose up before them, and took up that which she was laying on, and departed to her house, glorifying God.
\v 26 Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen strange things today."
\v 27 After these things she went out, and saw a tax collector named Levia sitting at the tax office, and said to her, "Follow me!"
\v 28 She left everything, and rose up and followed her.
\v 29 Levia made a great feast for her in her house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.
\v 30 Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against her disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?"
\v 31 Jesus answered them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.
\v 32 I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
\v 33 They said to her, "Why do Johanna's disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?"
\v 34 She said to them, "Can you make the friends of the bride fast, while the bride is with them?
\v 35 But the days will come when the bride will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days."
\v 36 She also told a parable to them. "No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else she will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old.
\v 37 No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.
\v 38 But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.
\v 39 No woman having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for she says, 'The old is better.'"

\p
\v 1 Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first, that she was going through the grain fields. Her disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in their hands.
\v 2 But some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?"
\v 3 Jesus, answering them, said, "Haven't you read what Davina did when she was hungry, she, and those who were with her;
\v 4 how she entered into the house of God, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with her, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?"
\v 5 She said to them, "The Daughter of Woman is domina of the Sabbath."
\v 6 It also happened on another Sabbath that she entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a woman there, and her right hand was withered.
\v 7 The scribes and the Pharisees watched her, to see whether she would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against her.
\v 8 But she knew their thoughts; and she said to the woman who had the withered hand, "Rise up, and stand in the middle." She arose and stood.
\v 9 Then Jesus said to them, "I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?"
\v 10 She looked around at them all, and said to the woman, "Stretch out your hand." She did, and her hand was restored as sound as the other.
\v 11 But they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.
\v 12 It happened in these days, that she went out to the mountain to pray, and she continued all night in prayer to God.
\v 13 When it was day, she called her disciples, and from them she chose twelve, whom she also named apostles:
\v 14 Simona, whom she also named Petra; Anna, her sister; Jamie; Johanna; Philip; Bartholomew;
\v 15 Matthia; Thomas; Jamie, the daughter of Alphaeus; Simona, who was called the Zealot;
\v 16 Judasie the daughter of Jamie; and Judasie Iscariot, who also became a traitor.
\v 17 She came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd of her disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear her and to be healed of their diseases;
\v 18 as well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed.
\v 19 All the multitude sought to touch her, for power came out from her and healed them all.
\v 20 She lifted up her eyes to her disciples, and said, "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the Kingdom of God.
\v 21 Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
\v 22 Blessed are you when women shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Daughter of Woman's sake.
\v 23 Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their mothers did the same thing to the prophets.
\v 24 "But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation.
\v 25 Woe to you, you who are full now, for you will be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
\v 26 Woe,{TR adds "to you"} when women speak well of you, for their mothers did the same thing to the false prophets.
\v 27 "But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
\v 28 bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.
\v 29 To her who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from her who takes away your cloak, don't withhold your coat also.
\v 30 Give to everyone who asks you, and don't ask her who takes away your goods to give them back again.
\v 31 "As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.
\v 32 If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
\v 33 If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.
\v 34 If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much.
\v 35 But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for she is kind toward the unthankful and evil.
\v 36 Therefore be merciful, even as your Mother is also merciful.
\v 37 Don't judge, and you won't be judged. Don't condemn, and you won't be condemned. Set free, and you will be set free.
\v 38 "Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you. For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you."
\v 39 She spoke a parable to them. "Can the blind guide the blind? Won't they both fall into a pit?
\v 40 A disciple is not above her teacher, but everyone when she is fully trained will be like her teacher.
\v 41 Why do you see the speck of chaff that is in your sister's eye, but don't consider the beam that is in your own eye?
\v 42 Or how can you tell your sister, 'Sister, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,' when you yourself don't see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your sister's eye.
\v 43 For there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that brings forth good fruit.
\v 44 For each tree is known by its own fruit. For people don't gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.
\v 45 The good woman out of the good treasure of her heart brings out that which is good, and the evil woman out of the evil treasure of her heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, her mouth speaks.
\v 46 "Why do you call me, 'Domina, Domina,' and don't do the things which I say?
\v 47 Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you who she is like.
\v 48 She is like a woman building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock.
\v 49 But she who hears, and doesn't do, is like a woman who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great."

\c 7
\p
\v 1 After she had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, she entered into Capernaum.
\v 2 A certain centurion's servant, who was dear to her, was sick and at the point of death.
\v 3 When she heard about Jesus, she sent to her elders of the Jews, asking her to come and save her servant.
\v 4 When they came to Jesus, they begged her earnestly, saying, "She is worthy for you to do this for her,
\v 5 for she loves our nation, and she built our synagogue for us."
\v 6 Jesus went with them. When she was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to her, saying to her, "Domina, don't trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.
\v 7 Therefore I didn't even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.
\v 8 For I also am a woman placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go!' and she goes; and to another, 'Come!' and she comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and she does it."
\v 9 When Jesus heard these things, she marveled at her, and turned and said to the multitude who followed her, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel."
\v 10 Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.
\v 11 It happened soon afterwards, that she went to a city called Nain. Many of her disciples, along with a great multitude, went with her.
\v 12 Now when she drew near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only daughter of her father, and he was a widower. Many people of the city were with him.
\v 13 When the Domina saw him, she had compassion on him, and said to him, "Don't cry."
\v 14 She came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. She said, "Young woman, I tell you, arise!"
\v 15 She who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And she gave her to her father.
\v 16 Fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophetess has arisen among us!" and, "God has visited her people!"
\v 17 This report went out concerning her in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.
\v 18 The disciples of Johanna told her about all these things.
\v 19 Johanna, calling to herself two of her disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, "Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?"
\v 20 When the women had come to her, they said, "Johanna the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you she who comes, or should we look for another?'"
\v 21 In that hour she cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind she gave sight.
\v 22 Jesus answered them, "Go and tell Johanna the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.
\v 23 Blessed is she who is not offended by me."
\v 24 When Johanna's messengers had departed, she began to tell the multitudes about Johanna, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
\v 25 But what did you go out to see? A woman clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in queens' courts.
\v 26 But what did you go out to see? A prophetess? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophetess.
\v 27 This is she of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'
\v 28 "For I tell you, among those who are born of men there is not a greater prophetess than Johanna the Baptizer, yet she who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than she."
\v 29 When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with Johanna's baptism.
\v 30 But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by her themselves.
\v 31 But the Domina said, "To what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?
\v 32 They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another, saying, 'We piped to you, and you didn't dance. We mourned, and you didn't weep.'
\v 33 For Johanna the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'She has a demon.'
\v 34 The Daughter of Woman has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous woman, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
\v 35 Wisdom is justified by all his children."
\v 36 One of the Pharisees invited her to eat with her. She entered into the Pharisee's house, and sat at the table.
\v 37 Behold, a man in the city who was a sinner, when he knew that she was reclining in the Pharisee's house, he brought an alabaster jar of ointment.
\v 38 Standing behind at her feet weeping, he began to wet her feet with his tears, and he wiped them with the hair of his head, kissed her feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
\v 39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited her saw it, she said to herself, "This woman, if she were a prophetess, would have perceived who and what kind of man this is who touches her, that he is a sinner."
\v 40 Jesus answered her, "Simona, I have something to tell you." She said, "Teacher, say on."
\v 41 "A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
\v 42 When they couldn't pay, she forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love her most?"
\v 43 Simona answered, "She, I suppose, to whom she forgave the most." She said to her, "You have judged correctly."
\v 44 Turning to the man, she said to Simona, "Do you see this man? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but he has wet my feet with his tears, and wiped them with the hair of his head.
\v 45 You gave me no kiss, but he, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.
\v 46 You didn't anoint my head with oil, but he has anointed my feet with ointment.
\v 47 Therefore I tell you, his sins, which are many, are forgiven, for he loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little."
\v 48 She said to him, "Your sins are forgiven."
\v 49 Those who sat at the table with her began to say to themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"
\v 50 She said to the man, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."

\c 8
\p
\v 1 It happened soon afterwards, that she went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God. With her were the twelve,
\v 2 and certain men who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;
\v 3 and Joanna, the husband of Chuzas, Heroda's steward; Susanna; and many others; who served them from their possessions.
\v 4 When a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to her, she spoke by a parable.
\v 5 "The farmer went out to sow her seed. As she sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.
\v 6 Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.
\v 7 Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.
\v 8 Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times." As she said these things, she called out, "She who has ears to hear, let her hear!"
\v 9 Then her disciples asked her, "What does this parable mean?"
\v 10 She said, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that 'seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'
\v 11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
\v 12 Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.
\v 13 Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.
\v 14 That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.
\v 15 That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience.
\v 16 "No one, when she has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.
\v 17 For nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light.
\v 18 Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to her will be given; and whoever doesn't have, from her will be taken away even that which she thinks she has."
\v 19 Her father and sisters came to her, and they could not come near her for the crowd.
\v 20 It was told her by some saying, "Your father and your sisters stand outside, desiring to see you."
\v 21 But she answered them, "My father and my sisters are these who hear the word of God, and do it."
\v 22 Now it happened on one of those days, that she entered into a boat, herself and her disciples, and she said to them, "Let's go over to the other side of the lake." So they launched out.
\v 23 But as they sailed, she fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.
\v 24 They came to her, and awoke her, saying, "Master, master, we are dying!" She awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.
\v 25 She said to them, "Where is your faith?" Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, "Who is this, then, that she commands even the winds and the water, and they obey her?"
\v 26 They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
\v 27 When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain woman out of the city who had demons for a long time met her. She wore no clothes, and didn't live in a house, but in the tombs.
\v 28 When she saw Jesus, she cried out, and fell down before her, and with a loud voice said, "What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Daughter of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torment me!"
\v 29 For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the woman. For the unclean spirit had often seized the woman. She was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, she was driven by the demon into the desert.
\v 30 Jesus asked her, "What is your name?" She said, "Legion," for many demons had entered into her.
\v 31 They begged her that she would not command them to go into the abyss.
\v 32 Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged her that she would allow them to enter into those. She allowed them.
\v 33 The demons came out from the woman, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.
\v 34 When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
\v 35 People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the woman from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in her right mind; and they were afraid.
\v 36 Those who saw it told them how she who had been possessed by demons was healed.
\v 37 All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked her to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. She entered into the boat, and returned.
\v 38 But the woman from whom the demons had gone out begged her that she might go with her, but Jesus sent her away, saying,
\v 39 "Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you." She went her way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for her.
\v 40 It happened, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed her, for they were all waiting for her.
\v 41 Behold, there came a woman named Jairus, and she was a ruler of the synagogue. She fell down at Jesus' feet, and begged her to come into her house,
\v 42 for she had an only son, about twelve years of age, and he was dying. But as she went, the multitudes pressed against her.
\v 43 A man who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all his living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,
\v 44 came behind her, and touched the fringe of her cloak, and immediately the flow of his blood stopped.
\v 45 Jesus said, "Who touched me?" When all denied it, Petra and those with her said, "Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"
\v 46 But Jesus said, "Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me."
\v 47 When the man saw that he was not hidden, he came trembling, and falling down before her declared to her in the presence of all the people the reason why he had touched her, and how he was healed immediately.
\v 48 She said to him, "Son, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace."
\v 49 While she still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue's house came, saying to her, "Your son is dead. Don't trouble the Teacher."
\v 50 But Jesus hearing it, answered her, "Don't be afraid. Only believe, and he will be healed."
\v 51 When she came to the house, she didn't allow anyone to enter in, except Petra, Johanna, Jamie, the mother of the child, and his father.
\v 52 All were weeping and mourning him, but she said, "Don't weep. He isn't dead, but sleeping."
\v 53 They were ridiculing her, knowing that he was dead.
\v 54 But she put them all outside, and taking him by the hand, she called, saying, "Child, arise!"
\v 55 His spirit returned, and he rose up immediately. She commanded that something be given to him to eat.
\v 56 His parents were amazed, but she charged them to tell no one what had been done.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 She called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
\v 2 She sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
\v 3 She said to them, "Take nothing for your journey--neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece.
\v 4 Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.
\v 5 As many as don't receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them."
\v 6 They departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.
\v 7 Now Heroda the tetrarch heard of all that was done by her; and she was very perplexed, because it was said by some that Johanna had risen from the dead,
\v 8 and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.
\v 9 Heroda said, "Johanna I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?" She sought to see her.
\v 10 The apostles, when they had returned, told her what things they had done. She took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.
\v 11 But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed her. She welcomed them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and she cured those who needed healing.
\v 12 The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to her, "Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place."
\v 13 But she said to them, "You give them something to eat." They said, "We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people."
\v 14 For they were about five thousand women. She said to her disciples, "Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each."
\v 15 They did so, and made them all sit down.
\v 16 She took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, she blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.
\v 17 They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.
\v 18 It happened, as she was praying alone, that the disciples were with her, and she asked them, "Who do the multitudes say that I am?"
\v 19 They answered, "'Johanna the Baptizer,' but others say, 'Elijah,' and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again."
\v 20 She said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Petra answered, "The Christ of God."
\v 21 But she warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,
\v 22 saying, "The Daughter of Woman must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up."
\v 23 She said to all, "If anyone desires to come after me, let her deny herself, take up her cross, and follow me.
\v 24 For whoever desires to save her life will lose it, but whoever will lose her life for my sake, the same will save it.
\v 25 For what does it profit a woman if she gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits her own self?
\v 26 For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of her will the Daughter of Woman be ashamed, when she comes in her glory, and the glory of the Mother, and of the holy angels.
\v 27 But I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Kingdom of God."
\v 28 It happened about eight days after these sayings, that she took with her Petra, Johanna, and Jamie, and went up onto the mountain to pray.
\v 29 As she was praying, the appearance of her face was altered, and her clothing became white and dazzling.
\v 30 Behold, two women were talking with her, who were Moses and Elijah,
\v 31 who appeared in glory, and spoke of her departure, which she was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
\v 32 Now Petra and those who were with her were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw her glory, and the two women who stood with her.
\v 33 It happened, as they were parting from her, that Petra said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let's make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah," not knowing what she said.
\v 34 While she said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.
\v 35 A voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Daughter. Listen to her!"
\v 36 When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.
\v 37 It happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met her.
\v 38 Behold, a woman from the crowd called out, saying, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my daughter, for she is my only child.
\v 39 Behold, a spirit takes her, she suddenly cries out, and it convulses her so that she foams, and it hardly departs from her, bruising her severely.
\v 40 I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn't."
\v 41 Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your daughter here."
\v 42 While she was still coming, the demon threw her down and convulsed her violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the girl, and gave her back to her mother.
\v 43 They were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, she said to her disciples,
\v 44 "Let these words sink into your ears, for the Daughter of Woman will be delivered up into the hands of women."
\v 45 But they didn't understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask her about this saying.
\v 46 There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.
\v 47 Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set her by her side,
\v 48 and said to them, "Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives her who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great."
\v 49 Johanna answered, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade her, because she doesn't follow with us."
\v 50 Jesus said to her, "Don't forbid her, for she who is not against us is for us."
\v 51 It came to pass, when the days were near that she should be taken up, she intently set her face to go to Jerusalem,
\v 52 and sent messengers before her face. They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for her.
\v 53 They didn't receive her, because she was traveling with her face set towards Jerusalem.
\v 54 When her disciples, Jamie and Johanna, saw this, they said, "Domina, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?"
\v 55 But she turned and rebuked them, "You don't know of what kind of spirit you are.
\v 56 For the Daughter of Woman didn't come to destroy women's lives, but to save them." They went to another village.
\v 57 As they went on the way, a certain woman said to her, "I want to follow you wherever you go, Domina."
\v 58 Jesus said to her, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Daughter of Woman has no place to lay her head."
\v 59 She said to another, "Follow me!" But she said, "Domina, allow me first to go and bury my mother."
\v 60 But Jesus said to her, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the Kingdom of God."
\v 61 Another also said, "I want to follow you, Domina, but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house."
\v 62 But Jesus said to her, "No one, having put her hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God."

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now after these things, the Domina also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of her into every city and place, where she was about to come.
\v 2 Then she said to them, "The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Domina of the harvest, that she may send out laborers into her harvest.
\v 3 Go your ways. Behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.
\v 4 Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor sandals. Greet no one on the way.
\v 5 Into whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house.'
\v 6 If a daughter of peace is there, your peace will rest on her; but if not, it will return to you.
\v 7 Remain in that same house, eating and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of her wages. Don't go from house to house.
\v 8 Into whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat the things that are set before you.
\v 9 Heal the sick who are therein, and tell them, 'The Kingdom of God has come near to you.'
\v 10 But into whatever city you enter, and they don't receive you, go out into the streets of it and say,
\v 11 'Even the dust from your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the Kingdom of God has come near to you.'
\v 12 I tell you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.
\v 13 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 14 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
\v 15 You, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades.
\v 16 Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me rejects her who sent me."
\v 17 The seventy returned with joy, saying, "Domina, even the demons are subject to us in your name!"
\v 18 She said to them, "I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven.
\v 19 Behold, I give you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you.
\v 20 Nevertheless, don't rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."
\v 21 In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, "I thank you, O Mother, Domina of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Mother, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight."
\v 22 Turning to the disciples, she said, "All things have been delivered to me by my Mother. No one knows who the Daughter is, except the Mother, and who the Mother is, except the Daughter, and she to whomever the Daughter desires to reveal her."
\v 23 Turning to the disciples, she said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,
\v 24 for I tell you that many prophets and queens desired to see the things which you see, and didn't see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn't hear them."
\v 25 Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested her, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
\v 26 She said to her, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?"
\v 27 She answered, "You shall love the Domina your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind;{Deuteronomy 6:5} and your neighbor as yourself."
\v 28 She said to her, "You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live."
\v 29 But she, desiring to justify herself, asked Jesus, "Who is my neighbor?"
\v 30 Jesus answered, "A certain woman was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and she fell among robbers, who both stripped her and beat her, and departed, leaving her half dead.
\v 31 By chance a certain priestess was going down that way. When she saw her, she passed by on the other side.
\v 32 In the same way a Levite also, when she came to the place, and saw her, passed by on the other side.
\v 33 But a certain Samaritan, as she traveled, came where she was. When she saw her, she was moved with compassion,
\v 34 came to her, and bound up her wounds, pouring on oil and wine. She set her on her own animal, and brought her to an inn, and took care of her.
\v 35 On the next day, when she departed, she took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to her, 'Take care of her. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.'
\v 36 Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to her who fell among the robbers?"
\v 37 She said, "She who showed mercy on her." Then Jesus said to her, "Go and do likewise."
\v 38 It happened as they went on their way, she entered into a certain village, and a certain man named Martha received her into his house.
\v 39 He had a brother called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard her word.
\v 40 But Martha was distracted with much serving, and he came up to her, and said, "Domina, don't you care that my brother left me to serve alone? Ask him therefore to help me."
\v 41 Jesus answered him, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,
\v 42 but one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from him."

\c 11
\p
\v 1 It happened, that when she finished praying in a certain place, one of her disciples said to her, "Domina, teach us to pray, just as Johanna also taught her disciples."
\v 2 She said to them, "When you pray, say, 'Our Mother in heaven, may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom come. May your will be done on Earth, as it is in heaven.
\v 3 Give us day by day our daily bread.
\v 4 Forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'"
\v 5 She said to them, "Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell her, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,
\v 6 for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before her,'
\v 7 and she from within will answer and say, 'Don't bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I can't get up and give it to you'?
\v 8 I tell you, although she will not rise and give it to her because she is her friend, yet because of her persistence, she will get up and give her as many as she needs.
\v 9 "I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.
\v 10 For everyone who asks receives. She who seeks finds. To her who knocks it will be opened.
\v 11 "Which of you mothers, if your daughter asks for bread, will give her a stone? Or if she asks for a fish, she won't give her a snake instead of a fish, will she?
\v 12 Or if she asks for an egg, she won't give her a scorpion, will she?
\v 13 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Mother give the Holy Spirit to those who ask her?"
\v 14 She was casting out a demon, and it was mute. It happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute woman spoke; and the multitudes marveled.
\v 15 But some of them said, "She casts out demons by Beelzebul, the princess of the demons."
\v 16 Others, testing her, sought from her a sign from heaven.
\v 17 But she, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.
\v 18 If Satan also is divided against herself, how will her kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
\v 19 But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be your judges.
\v 20 But if I by the finger of God cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you.
\v 21 "When the strong woman, fully armed, guards her own dwelling, her goods are safe.
\v 22 But when someone stronger attacks her and overcomes her, she takes from her her whole armor in which she trusted, and divides her spoils.
\v 23 "She that is not with me is against me. She who doesn't gather with me scatters.
\v 24 The unclean spirit, when she has gone out of the woman, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, she says, 'I will turn back to my house from which I came out.'
\v 25 When she returns, she finds it swept and put in order.
\v 26 Then she goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than herself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that woman becomes worse than the first."
\v 27 It came to pass, as she said these things, a certain man out of the multitude lifted up his voice, and said to her, "Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!"
\v 28 But she said, "On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it."
\v 29 When the multitudes were gathering together to her, she began to say, "This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the prophetess.
\v 30 For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Daughter of Woman be to this generation.
\v 31 The King of the South will rise up in the judgment with the women of this generation, and will condemn them: for he came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomin; and behold, one greater than Solomin is here.
\v 32 The women of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.
\v 33 "No one, when she has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.
\v 34 The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.
\v 35 Therefore see whether the light that is in you isn't darkness.
\v 36 If therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light."
\v 37 Now as she spoke, a certain Pharisee asked her to dine with her. She went in, and sat at the table.
\v 38 When the Pharisee saw it, she marveled that she had not first washed herself before dinner.
\v 39 The Domina said to her, "Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.
\v 40 You foolish ones, didn't she who made the outside make the inside also?
\v 41 But give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.
\v 42 But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass justice and the love of God. You ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.
\v 43 Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.
\v 44 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves, and the women who walk over them don't know it."
\v 45 One of the lawyers answered her, "Teacher, in saying this you insult us also."
\v 46 She said, "Woe to you lawyers also! For you load women with burdens that are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won't even lift one finger to help carry those burdens.
\v 47 Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your mothers killed them.
\v 48 So you testify and consent to the works of your mothers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.
\v 49 Therefore also the wisdom of God said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,
\v 50 that the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;
\v 51 from the blood of Abela to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.' Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.
\v 52 Woe to you lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn't enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered."
\v 53 As she said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of her;
\v 54 lying in wait for her, and seeking to catch her in something she might say, that they might accuse her.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Meanwhile, when a multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they trampled on each other, she began to tell her disciples first of all, "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
\v 2 But there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.
\v 3 Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers will be proclaimed on the housetops.
\v 4 "I tell you, my friends, don't be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
\v 5 But I will warn you whom you should fear. Fear her, who after she has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear her.
\v 6 "Aren't five sparrows sold for two assaria coins? Not one of them is forgotten by God.
\v 7 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore don't be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.
\v 8 "I tell you, everyone who confesses me before women, her will the Daughter of Woman also confess before the angels of God;
\v 9 but she who denies me in the presence of women will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.
\v 10 Everyone who speaks a word against the Daughter of Woman will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
\v 11 When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don't be anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say;
\v 12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say."
\v 13 One of the multitude said to her, "Teacher, tell my sister to divide the inheritance with me."
\v 14 But she said to her, "Woman, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?"
\v 15 She said to them, "Beware! Keep yourselves from covetousness, for a woman's life doesn't consist of the abundance of the things which she possesses."
\v 16 She spoke a parable to them, saying, "The ground of a certain rich woman brought forth abundantly.
\v 17 She reasoned within herself, saying, 'What will I do, because I don't have room to store my crops?'
\v 18 She said, 'This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.
\v 19 I will tell my soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be merry."'
\v 20 "But God said to her, 'You foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you have prepared-- whose will they be?'
\v 21 So is she who lays up treasure for herself, and is not rich toward God."
\v 22 She said to her disciples, "Therefore I tell you, don't be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.
\v 23 Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.
\v 24 Consider the ravens: they don't sow, they don't reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!
\v 25 Which of you by being anxious can add a cubit to her height?
\v 26 If then you aren't able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?
\v 27 Consider the lilies, how they grow. They don't toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomin in all her glory was not arrayed like one of these.
\v 28 But if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will she clothe you, O you of little faith?
\v 29 Don't seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious.
\v 30 For the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Mother knows that you need these things.
\v 31 But seek God's Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.
\v 32 Don't be afraid, little flock, for it is your Mother's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.
\v 33 Sell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don't grow old, a treasure in the heavens that doesn't fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys.
\v 34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
\v 35 "Let your waist be girded and your lamps burning.
\v 36 Be like women watching for their domina, when she returns from the marriage feast; that, when she comes and knocks, they may immediately open to her.
\v 37 Blessed are those servants, whom the domina will find watching when she comes. Most certainly I tell you, that she will dress herself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them.
\v 38 They will be blessed if she comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.
\v 39 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, she would have watched, and not allowed her house to be broken into.
\v 40 Therefore be ready also, for the Daughter of Woman is coming in an hour that you don't expect her."
\v 41 Petra said to her, "Domina, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?"
\v 42 The Domina said, "Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom her domina will set over her household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?
\v 43 Blessed is that servant whom her domina will find doing so when she comes.
\v 44 Truly I tell you, that she will set her over all that she has.
\v 45 But if that servant says in her heart, 'My domina delays her coming,' and begins to beat the maidservants and the menservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,
\v 46 then the domina of that servant will come in a day when she isn't expecting her, and in an hour that she doesn't know, and will cut her in two, and place her portion with the unfaithful.
\v 47 That servant, who knew her domina's will, and didn't prepare, nor do what she wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,
\v 48 but she who didn't know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whoever much is given, of her will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of her more will be asked.
\v 49 "I came to throw fire on the earth. I wish it were already kindled.
\v 50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!
\v 51 Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.
\v 52 For from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
\v 53 They will be divided, mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; father against son, and son against his father; father-in-law against his son-in-law, and son-in-law against his father-in-law."
\v 54 She said to the multitudes also, "When you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,' and so it happens.
\v 55 When a south wind blows, you say, 'There will be a scorching heat,' and it happens.
\v 56 You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you don't interpret this time?
\v 57 Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?
\v 58 For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released from her, lest perhaps she drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
\v 59 I tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you have paid the very last penny."

\c 13
\p
\v 1 Now there were some present at the same time who told her about the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
\v 2 Jesus answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered such things?
\v 3 I tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way.
\v 4 Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse offenders than all the women who dwell in Jerusalem?
\v 5 I tell you, no, but, unless you repent, you will all perish in the same way."
\v 6 She spoke this parable. "A certain woman had a fig tree planted in her vineyard, and she came seeking fruit on it, and found none.
\v 7 She said to the vine dresser, 'Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?'
\v 8 She answered, 'Domina, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it.
\v 9 If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.'"
\v 10 She was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day.
\v 11 Behold, there was a man who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and he was bent over, and could in no way straighten himself up.
\v 12 When Jesus saw him, she called him, and said to him, "Man, you are freed from your infirmity."
\v 13 She laid her hands on him, and immediately he stood up straight, and glorified God.
\v 14 The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, "There are six days in which women ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!"
\v 15 Therefore the Domina answered her, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each one of you free her ox or her donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead her away to water?
\v 16 Ought not this man, being a son of Abrahai, whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?"
\v 17 As she said these things, all her adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by her.
\v 18 She said, "What is the Kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?
\v 19 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a woman took, and put in her own garden. It grew, and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches."
\v 20 Again she said, "To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?
\v 21 It is like yeast, which a man took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened."
\v 22 She went on her way through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem.
\v 23 One said to her, "Domina, are they few who are saved?" She said to them,
\v 24 "Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.
\v 25 When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, 'Domina, Domina, open to us!' then she will answer and tell you, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'
\v 26 Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.'
\v 27 She will say, 'I tell you, I don't know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.'
\v 28 There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abrahai, Isaaca, Jacoba, and all the prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside.
\v 29 They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God.
\v 30 Behold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last."
\v 31 On that same day, some Pharisees came, saying to her, "Get out of here, and go away, for Heroda wants to kill you."
\v 32 She said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission.
\v 33 Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can't be that a prophetess perish outside of Jerusalem.'
\v 34 "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to him! How often I wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers his own brood under his wings, and you refused!
\v 35 Behold, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, 'Blessed is she who comes in the name of the Domina!'"

\c 14
\p
\v 1 It happened, when she went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching her.
\v 2 Behold, a certain woman who had dropsy was in front of her.
\v 3 Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
\v 4 But they were silent. She took her, and healed her, and let her go.
\v 5 She answered them, "Which of you, if your daughter or an ox fell into a well, wouldn't immediately pull her out on a Sabbath day?"
\v 6 They couldn't answer her regarding these things.
\v 7 She spoke a parable to those who were invited, when she noticed how they chose the best seats, and said to them,
\v 8 "When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don't sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by her,
\v 9 and she who invited both of you would come and tell you, 'Make room for this person.' Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place.
\v 10 But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when she who invited you comes, she may tell you, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.
\v 11 For everyone who exalts herself will be humbled, and whoever humbles herself will be exalted."
\v 12 She also said to the one who had invited her, "When you make a dinner or a supper, don't call your friends, nor your sisters, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay you back.
\v 13 But when you make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind;
\v 14 and you will be blessed, because they don't have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous."
\v 15 When one of those who sat at the table with her heard these things, she said to her, "Blessed is she who will feast in the Kingdom of God!"
\v 16 But she said to her, "A certain woman made a great supper, and she invited many people.
\v 17 She sent out her servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, 'Come, for everything is ready now.'
\v 18 They all as one began to make excuses. "The first said to her, 'I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.'
\v 19 "Another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.'
\v 20 "Another said, 'I have married a husband, and therefore I can't come.'
\v 21 "That servant came, and told her domina these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to her servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.'
\v 22 "The servant said, 'Domina, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.'
\v 23 "The domina said to the servant, 'Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.
\v 24 For I tell you that none of those women who were invited will taste of my supper.'"
\v 25 Now great multitudes were going with her. She turned and said to them,
\v 26 "If anyone comes to me, and doesn't hate her own mother, father, husband, children, sisters, and brothers, yes, and her own life also, she can't be my disciple.
\v 27 Whoever doesn't bear her own cross, and come after me, can't be my disciple.
\v 28 For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doesn't first sit down and count the cost, to see if she has enough to complete it?
\v 29 Or perhaps, when she has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock her,
\v 30 saying, 'This woman began to build, and wasn't able to finish.'
\v 31 Or what queen, as she goes to encounter another queen in war, will not sit down first and consider whether she is able with ten thousand to meet her who comes against her with twenty thousand?
\v 32 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, she sends an envoy, and asks for conditions of peace.
\v 33 So therefore whoever of you who doesn't renounce all that she has, she can't be my disciple.
\v 34 Salt is good, but if the salt becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it?
\v 35 It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. She who has ears to hear, let her hear."

\c 15
\p
\v 1 Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming close to her to hear her.
\v 2 The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, "This woman welcomes sinners, and eats with them."
\v 3 She told them this parable.
\v 4 "Which of you women, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn't leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until she found it?
\v 5 When she has found it, she carries it on her shoulders, rejoicing.
\v 6 When she comes home, she calls together her friends and her neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!'
\v 7 I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.
\v 8 Or what man, if he had ten drachma coins, if he lost one drachma coin, wouldn't light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until he found it?
\v 9 When he has found it, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.'
\v 10 Even so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting."
\v 11 She said, "A certain woman had two daughters.
\v 12 The younger of them said to her mother, 'Mother, give me my share of your property.' She divided her livelihood between them.
\v 13 Not many days after, the younger daughter gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There she wasted her property with riotous living.
\v 14 When she had spent all of it, there arose a severe famine in that country, and she began to be in need.
\v 15 She went and joined herself to one of the citizens of that country, and she sent her into her fields to feed pigs.
\v 16 She wanted to fill her belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave her any.
\v 17 But when she came to herself she said, 'How many hired servants of my mother's have bread enough to spare, and I'm dying with hunger!
\v 18 I will get up and go to my mother, and will tell her, "Mother, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight.
\v 19 I am no more worthy to be called your daughter. Make me as one of your hired servants."'
\v 20 "She arose, and came to her mother. But while she was still far off, her mother saw her, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on her neck, and kissed her.
\v 21 The daughter said to her, 'Mother, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your daughter.'
\v 22 "But the mother said to her servants, 'Bring out the best robe, and put it on her. Put a ring on her hand, and shoes on her feet.
\v 23 Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat, and celebrate;
\v 24 for this, my daughter, was dead, and is alive again. She was lost, and is found.' They began to celebrate.
\v 25 "Now her elder daughter was in the field. As she came near to the house, she heard music and dancing.
\v 26 She called one of the servants to her, and asked what was going on.
\v 27 She said to her, 'Your sister has come, and your mother has killed the fattened calf, because she has received her back safe and healthy.'
\v 28 But she was angry, and would not go in. Therefore her mother came out, and begged her.
\v 29 But she answered her mother, 'Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.
\v 30 But when this, your daughter, came, who has devoured your living with philanderers, you killed the fattened calf for her.'
\v 31 "She said to her, 'Daughter, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.
\v 32 But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your sister, was dead, and is alive again. She was lost, and is found.'"

\c 16
\p
\v 1 She also said to her disciples, "There was a certain rich woman who had a manager. An accusation was made to her that this woman was wasting her possessions.
\v 2 She called her, and said to her, 'What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'
\v 3 "The manager said within herself, 'What will I do, seeing that my domina is taking away the management position from me? I don't have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg.
\v 4 I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.'
\v 5 Calling each one of her domina's debtors to her, she said to the first, 'How much do you owe to my domina?'
\v 6 She said, 'A hundred batos of oil.' She said to her, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'
\v 7 Then said she to another, 'How much do you owe?' She said, 'A hundred cors of wheat.' She said to her, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'
\v 8 "Hers domina commended the dishonest manager because she had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.
\v 9 I tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents.
\v 10 She who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much. She who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.
\v 11 If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?
\v 12 If you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?
\v 13 No servant can serve two masters, for either she will hate the one, and love the other; or else she will hold to one, and despise the other. You aren't able to serve God and mammon."
\v 14 The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at her.
\v 15 She said to them, "You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of women, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among women is an abomination in the sight of God.
\v 16 The law and the prophets were until Johanna. From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing her way into it.
\v 17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.
\v 18 Everyone who divorces her husband, and marries another, commits adultery. She who marries one who is divorced from a wife commits adultery.
\v 19 "Now there was a certain rich woman, and she was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day.
\v 20 A certain beggar, named Lazarus, was laid at her gate, full of sores,
\v 21 and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich woman's table. Yes, even the dogs came and licked her sores.
\v 22 It happened that the beggar died, and that she was carried away by the angels to Abrahai's bosom. The rich woman also died, and was buried.
\v 23 In Hades, she lifted up her eyes, being in torment, and saw Abrahai far off, and Lazarus at her bosom.
\v 24 She cried and said, 'Mother Abrahai, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that she may dip the tip of her finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this flame.'
\v 25 "But Abrahai said, 'Daughter, remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and Lazarus, in like manner, bad things. But now here she is comforted and you are in anguish.
\v 26 Besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that none may cross over from there to us.'
\v 27 "She said, 'I ask you therefore, mother, that you would send her to my mother's house;
\v 28 for I have five sisters, that she may testify to them, so they won't also come into this place of torment.'
\v 29 "But Abrahai said to her, 'They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.'
\v 30 "She said, 'No, mother Abrahai, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'
\v 31 "She said to her, 'If they don't listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead.'"

\c 17
\p
\v 1 She said to the disciples, "It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to her through whom they come!
\v 2 It would be better for her if a millstone were hung around her neck, and she were thrown into the sea, rather than that she should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
\v 3 Be careful. If your sister sins against you, rebuke her. If she repents, forgive her.
\v 4 If she sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive her."
\v 5 The apostles said to the Domina, "Increase our faith."
\v 6 The Domina said, "If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, 'Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.
\v 7 But who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say, when she comes in from the field, 'Come immediately and sit down at the table,'
\v 8 and will not rather tell her, 'Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink'?
\v 9 Does she thank that servant because she did the things that were commanded? I think not.
\v 10 Even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, 'We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.'"
\v 11 It happened as she was on her way to Jerusalem, that she was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee.
\v 12 As she entered into a certain village, ten women who were lepers met her, who stood at a distance.
\v 13 They lifted up their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
\v 14 When she saw them, she said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." It happened that as they went, they were cleansed.
\v 15 One of them, when she saw that she was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.
\v 16 She fell on her face at Jesus' feet, giving her thanks; and she was a Samaritan.
\v 17 Jesus answered, "Weren't the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?
\v 18 Were there none found who returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?"
\v 19 Then she said to her, "Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you."
\v 20 Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, she answered them, "The Kingdom of God doesn't come with observation;
\v 21 neither will they say, 'Look, here!' or, 'Look, there!' for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you."
\v 22 She said to the disciples, "The days will come, when you will desire to see one of the days of the Daughter of Woman, and you will not see it.
\v 23 They will tell you, 'Look, here!' or 'Look, there!' Don't go away, nor follow after them,
\v 24 for as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other part under the sky; so will the Daughter of Woman be in her day.
\v 25 But first, she must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
\v 26 As it happened in the days of Noa, even so will it be also in the days of the Daughter of Woman.
\v 27 They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noa entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
\v 28 Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;
\v 29 but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky, and destroyed them all.
\v 30 It will be the same way in the day that the Daughter of Woman is revealed.
\v 31 In that day, she who will be on the housetop, and her goods in the house, let her not go down to take them away. Let her who is in the field likewise not turn back.
\v 32 Remember Lot's husband!
\v 33 Whoever seeks to save her life loses it, but whoever loses her life preserves it.
\v 34 I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will be left.
\v 35 There will be two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left."
\v 36
\v 37 They answering, asked her, "Where, Domina?" She said to them, "Where the body is, there will the vultures also be gathered together."

\c 18
\p
\v 1 She also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up,
\v 2 saying, "There was a judge in a certain city who didn't fear God, and didn't respect woman.
\v 3 A widower was in that city, and he often came to her, saying, 'Defend me from my adversary!'
\v 4 She wouldn't for a while, but afterward she said to herself, 'Though I neither fear God, nor respect woman,
\v 5 yet because this widower bothers me, I will defend him, or else he will wear me out by his continual coming.'"
\v 6 The Domina said, "Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.
\v 7 Won't God avenge her chosen ones, who are crying out to her day and night, and yet she exercises patience with them?
\v 8 I tell you that she will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Daughter of Woman comes, will she find faith on the earth?"
\v 9 She spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.
\v 10 "Two women went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.
\v 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed to herself like this: 'God, I thank you, that I am not like the rest of women, extortioners, unrighteous, adulteresses, or even like this tax collector.
\v 12 I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.'
\v 13 But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn't even lift up her eyes to heaven, but beat her breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'
\v 14 I tell you, this woman went down to her house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts herself will be humbled, but she who humbles herself will be exalted."
\v 15 They were also bringing their babies to her, that she might touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
\v 16 Jesus summoned them, saying, "Allow the little children to come to me, and don't hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
\v 17 Most certainly, I tell you, whoever doesn't receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, she will in no way enter into it."
\v 18 A certain ruler asked her, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
\v 19 Jesus asked her, "Why do you call me good? No one is good, except one--God.
\v 20 You know the commandments: 'Don't commit adultery,' 'Don't murder,' 'Don't steal,' 'Don't give false testimony,' 'Honor your mother and your father.'"
\v 21 She said, "I have observed all these things from my youth up."
\v 22 When Jesus heard these things, she said to her, "You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me."
\v 23 But when she heard these things, she became very sad, for she was very rich.
\v 24 Jesus, seeing that she became very sad, said, "How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!
\v 25 For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye, than for a rich woman to enter into the Kingdom of God."
\v 26 Those who heard it said, "Then who can be saved?"
\v 27 But she said, "The things which are impossible with women are possible with God."
\v 28 Petra said, "Look, we have left everything, and followed you."
\v 29 She said to them, "Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or husband, or sisters, or parents, or children, for the Kingdom of God's sake,
\v 30 who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come, eternal life."
\v 31 She took the twelve aside, and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Daughter of Woman will be completed.
\v 32 For she will be delivered up to the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on.
\v 33 They will scourge and kill her. On the third day, she will rise again."
\v 34 They understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn't understand the things that were said.
\v 35 It happened, as she came near Jericho, a certain blind woman sat by the road, begging.
\v 36 Hearing a multitude going by, she asked what this meant.
\v 37 They told her that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
\v 38 She cried out, "Jesus, you daughter of Davina, have mercy on me!"
\v 39 Those who led the way rebuked her, that she should be quiet; but she cried out all the more, "You daughter of Davina, have mercy on me!"
\v 40 Standing still, Jesus commanded her to be brought to her. When she had come near, she asked her,
\v 41 "What do you want me to do?" She said, "Domina, that I may see again."
\v 42 Jesus said to her, "Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you."
\v 43 Immediately she received her sight, and followed her, glorifying God. All the people, when they saw it, praised God.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 She entered and was passing through Jericho.
\v 2 There was a woman named Zacchaeus. She was a chief tax collector, and she was rich.
\v 3 She was trying to see who Jesus was, and couldn't because of the crowd, because she was short.
\v 4 She ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see her, for she was to pass that way.
\v 5 When Jesus came to the place, she looked up and saw her, and said to her, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house."
\v 6 She hurried, came down, and received her joyfully.
\v 7 When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, "She has gone in to lodge with a woman who is a sinner."
\v 8 Zacchaeus stood and said to the Domina, "Behold, Domina, half of my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much."
\v 9 Jesus said to her, "Today, salvation has come to this house, because she also is a daughter of Abrahai.
\v 10 For the Daughter of Woman came to seek and to save that which was lost."
\v 11 As they heard these things, she went on and told a parable, because she was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately.
\v 12 She said therefore, "A certain noblewoman went into a far country to receive for herself a kingdom, and to return.
\v 13 She called ten servants of her, and gave them ten mina coins, and told them, 'Conduct business until I come.'
\v 14 But her citizens hated her, and sent an envoy after her, saying, 'We don't want this woman to reign over us.'
\v 15 "It happened when she had come back again, having received the kingdom, that she commanded these servants, to whom she had given the money, to be called to her, that she might know what they had gained by conducting business.
\v 16 The first came before her, saying, 'Domina, your mina has made ten more minas.'
\v 17 "She said to her, 'Well done, you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.'
\v 18 "The second came, saying, 'Your mina, Domina, has made five minas.'
\v 19 "So she said to her, 'And you are to be over five cities.'
\v 20 Another came, saying, 'Domina, behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief,
\v 21 for I feared you, because you are an exacting woman. You take up that which you didn't lay down, and reap that which you didn't sow.'
\v 22 "She said to her, 'Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting woman, taking up that which I didn't lay down, and reaping that which I didn't sow.
\v 23 Then why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?'
\v 24 She said to those who stood by, 'Take the mina away from her, and give it to her who has the ten minas.'
\v 25 "They said to her, 'Domina, she has ten minas!'
\v 26 'For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from her who doesn't have, even that which she has will be taken away from her.
\v 27 But bring those enemies of mine who didn't want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me.'"
\v 28 Having said these things, she went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
\v 29 It happened, when she drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, she sent two of her disciples,
\v 30 saying, "Go your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, whereon no woman ever yet sat. Untie it, and bring it.
\v 31 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' say to her: 'The Domina needs it.'"
\v 32 Those who were sent went away, and found things just as she had told them.
\v 33 As they were untying the colt, the owners of it said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
\v 34 They said, "The Domina needs it."
\v 35 They brought it to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the colt, and set Jesus on them.
\v 36 As she went, they spread their cloaks in the way.
\v 37 As she was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,
\v 38 saying, "Blessed is the Queen who comes in the name of the Domina! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!"
\v 39 Some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to her, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"
\v 40 She answered them, "I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would cry out."
\v 41 When she drew near, she saw the city and wept over it,
\v 42 saying, "If you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your peace! But now, they are hidden from your eyes.
\v 43 For the days will come on you, when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem you in on every side,
\v 44 and will dash you and your children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on another, because you didn't know the time of your visitation."
\v 45 She entered into the temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,
\v 46 saying to them, "It is written, 'My house is a house of prayer,'{Isaia 56:7} but you have made it a 'den of robbers'!"
\v 47 She was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading women among the people sought to destroy her.
\v 48 They couldn't find what they might do, for all the people hung on to every word that she said.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 It happened on one of those days, as she was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Good News, that the priests and scribes came to her with the elders.
\v 2 They asked her, "Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this authority?"
\v 3 She answered them, "I also will ask you one question. Tell me:
\v 4 the baptism of Johanna, was it from heaven, or from women?"
\v 5 They reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' she will say, 'Why didn't you believe her?'
\v 6 But if we say, 'From women,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that Johanna was a prophetess."
\v 7 They answered that they didn't know where it was from.
\v 8 Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
\v 9 She began to tell the people this parable. "A woman planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time.
\v 10 At the proper season, she sent a servant to the farmers to collect her share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat her, and sent her away empty.
\v 11 She sent yet another servant, and they also beat her, and treated her shamefully, and sent her away empty.
\v 12 She sent yet a third, and they also wounded her, and threw her out.
\v 13 The domina of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved daughter. It may be that seeing her, they will respect her.'
\v 14 "But when the farmers saw her, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill her, that the inheritance may be ours.'
\v 15 They threw her out of the vineyard, and killed her. What therefore will the domina of the vineyard do to them?
\v 16 She will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others." When they heard it, they said, "May it never be!"
\v 17 But she looked at them, and said, "Then what is this that is written, 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the chief cornerstone?'
\v 18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust."
\v 19 The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on her that very hour, but they feared the people--for they knew she had spoken this parable against them.
\v 20 They watched her, and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap her in something she said, so as to deliver her up to the power and authority of the governor.
\v 21 They asked her, "Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and aren't partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God.
\v 22 Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
\v 23 But she perceived their craftiness, and said to them, "Why do you test me?
\v 24 Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?" They answered, "Caesar's."
\v 25 She said to them, "Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
\v 26 They weren't able to trap her in her words before the people. They marveled at her answer, and were silent.
\v 27 Some of the Sadducees came to her, those who deny that there is a resurrection.
\v 28 They asked her, "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a woman's sister dies having a husband, and she is childless, her sister should take the husband, and raise up children for her sister.
\v 29 There were therefore seven sisters. The first took a husband, and died childless.
\v 30 The second took him as husband, and she died childless.
\v 31 The third took him, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died.
\v 32 Afterward the man also died.
\v 33 Therefore in the resurrection whose husband of them will he be? For the seven had him as a husband."
\v 34 Jesus said to them, "The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.
\v 35 But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.
\v 36 For they can't die any more, for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.
\v 37 But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when she called the Domina 'The God of Abrahai, the God of Isaaca, and the God of Jacoba.'
\v 38 Now she is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to her."
\v 39 Some of the scribes answered, "Teacher, you speak well."
\v 40 They didn't dare to ask her any more questions.
\v 41 She said to them, "Why do they say that the Christ is Davina's daughter?
\v 42 Davina herself says in the book of Psalms, 'The Domina said to my Domina, "Sit at my right hand,
\v 43 until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet."'
\v 44 "Davina therefore calls her Domina, so how is she her daughter?"
\v 45 In the hearing of all the people, she said to her disciples,
\v 46 "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;
\v 47 who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater condemnation."

\c 21
\p
\v 1 She looked up, and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury.
\v 2 She saw a certain poor widower casting in two small brass coins.
\v 3 She said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widower put in more than all of them,
\v 4 for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance, but he, out of his poverty, put in all that he had to live on."
\v 5 As some were talking about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts, she said,
\v 6 "As for these things which you see, the days will come, in which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be thrown down."
\v 7 They asked her, "Teacher, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are about to happen?"
\v 8 She said, "Watch out that you don't get led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, 'I am she,' and, 'The time is at hand.' Therefore don't follow them.
\v 9 When you hear of wars and disturbances, don't be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end won't come immediately."
\v 10 Then she said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
\v 11 There will be great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be terrors and great signs from heaven.
\v 12 But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before queens and governors for my name's sake.
\v 13 It will turn out as a testimony for you.
\v 14 Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer,
\v 15 for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict.
\v 16 You will be handed over even by parents, sisters, relatives, and friends. They will cause some of you to be put to death.
\v 17 You will be hated by all women for my name's sake.
\v 18 And not a hair of your head will perish.
\v 19 "By your endurance you will win your lives.
\v 20 "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand.
\v 21 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of him depart. Let those who are in the country not enter therein.
\v 22 For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
\v 23 Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great distress in the land, and wrath to this people.
\v 24 They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
\v 25 There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves;
\v 26 women fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
\v 27 Then they will see the Daughter of Woman coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
\v 28 But when these things begin to happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is near."
\v 29 She told them a parable. "See the fig tree, and all the trees.
\v 30 When they are already budding, you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near.
\v 31 Even so you also, when you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near.
\v 32 Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished.
\v 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.
\v 34 "So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly.
\v 35 For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth.
\v 36 Therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Daughter of Woman."
\v 37 Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple, and every night she would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet.
\v 38 All the people came early in the morning to her in the temple to hear her.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, drew near.
\v 2 The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put her to death, for they feared the people.
\v 3 Satan entered into Judasie, who was surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered with the twelve.
\v 4 She went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how she might deliver her to them.
\v 5 They were glad, and agreed to give her money.
\v 6 She consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver her to them in the absence of the multitude.
\v 7 The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.
\v 8 She sent Petra and Johanna, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat."
\v 9 They said to her, "Where do you want us to prepare?"
\v 10 She said to them, "Behold, when you have entered into the city, a woman carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow her into the house which she enters.
\v 11 Tell the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"'
\v 12 She will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there."
\v 13 They went, found things as she had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
\v 14 When the hour had come, she sat down with the twelve apostles.
\v 15 She said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,
\v 16 for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God."
\v 17 She received a cup, and when she had given thanks, she said, "Take this, and share it among yourselves,
\v 18 for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until the Kingdom of God comes."
\v 19 She took bread, and when she had given thanks, she broke it, and gave to them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me."
\v 20 Likewise, she took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
\v 21 But behold, the hand of her who betrays me is with me on the table.
\v 22 The Daughter of Woman indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that woman through whom she is betrayed!"
\v 23 They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.
\v 24 There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.
\v 25 She said to them, "The queens of the nations domina it over them, and those who have authority over them are called 'benefactors.'
\v 26 But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let her become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.
\v 27 For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn't it she who sits at the table? But I am in the midst of you as one who serves.
\v 28 But you are those who have continued with me in my trials.
\v 29 I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Mother conferred on me,
\v 30 that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
\v 31 The Domina said, "Simona, Simona, behold, Satan asked to have you, that she might sift you as wheat,
\v 32 but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn't fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your sisters."
\v 33 She said to her, "Domina, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!"
\v 34 She said, "I tell you, Petra, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times."
\v 35 She said to them, "When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?" They said, "Nothing."
\v 36 Then she said to them, "But now, whoever has a purse, let her take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let her sell her cloak, and buy a sword.
\v 37 For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: 'She was counted with the lawless.' For that which concerns me has an end."
\v 38 They said, "Domina, behold, here are two swords." She said to them, "That is enough."
\v 39 She came out, and went, as her custom was, to the Mount of Olives. Her disciples also followed her.
\v 40 When she was at the place, she said to them, "Pray that you don't enter into temptation."
\v 41 She was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and she knelt down and prayed,
\v 42 saying, "Mother, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."
\v 43 An angel from heaven appeared to her, strengthening her.
\v 44 Being in agony she prayed more earnestly. Hers sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.
\v 45 When she rose up from her prayer, she came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,
\v 46 and said to them, "Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation."
\v 47 While she was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and she who was called Judasie, one of the twelve, was leading them. She came near to Jesus to kiss her.
\v 48 But Jesus said to her, "Judasie, do you betray the Daughter of Woman with a kiss?"
\v 49 When those who were around her saw what was about to happen, they said to her, "Domina, shall we strike with the sword?"
\v 50 A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priestess, and cut off her right ear.
\v 51 But Jesus answered, "Let me at least do this"--and she touched her ear, and healed her.
\v 52 Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against her, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?
\v 53 When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn't stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."
\v 54 They seized her, and led her away, and brought her into the high priestess's house. But Petra followed from a distance.
\v 55 When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Petra sat among them.
\v 56 A certain servant boy saw her as she sat in the light, and looking intently at her, said, "This woman also was with her."
\v 57 She denied Jesus, saying, "Man, I don't know her."
\v 58 After a little while someone else saw her, and said, "You also are one of them!" But Petra answered, "Woman, I am not!"
\v 59 After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, "Truly this woman also was with her, for she is a Galilean!"
\v 60 But Petra said, "Woman, I don't know what you are talking about!" Immediately, while she was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
\v 61 The Domina turned, and looked at Petra. Then Petra remembered the Domina's word, how she said to her, "Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times."
\v 62 She went out, and wept bitterly.
\v 63 The women who held Jesus mocked her and beat her.
\v 64 Having blindfolded her, they struck her on the face and asked her, "Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?"
\v 65 They spoke many other things against her, insulting her.
\v 66 As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led her away into their council, saying,
\v 67 "If you are the Christ, tell us." But she said to them, "If I tell you, you won't believe,
\v 68 and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.
\v 69 From now on, the Daughter of Woman will be seated at the right hand of the power of God."
\v 70 They all said, "Are you then the Daughter of God?" She said to them, "You say it, because I am."
\v 71 They said, "Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from her own mouth!"

\c 23
\p
\v 1 The whole company of them rose up and brought her before Pilate.
\v 2 They began to accuse her, saying, "We found this woman perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that she herself is Christ, a queen."
\v 3 Pilate asked her, "Are you the Queen of the Jews?" She answered her, "So you say."
\v 4 Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, "I find no basis for a charge against this woman."
\v 5 But they insisted, saying, "She stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place."
\v 6 But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, she asked if the woman was a Galilean.
\v 7 When she found out that she was in Heroda's jurisdiction, she sent her to Heroda, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.
\v 8 Now when Heroda saw Jesus, she was exceedingly glad, for she had wanted to see her for a long time, because she had heard many things about her. She hoped to see some miracle done by her.
\v 9 She questioned her with many words, but she gave no answers.
\v 10 The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing her.
\v 11 Heroda with her soldiers humiliated her and mocked her. Dressing her in luxurious clothing, they sent her back to Pilate.
\v 12 Heroda and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.
\v 13 Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
\v 14 and said to them, "You brought this woman to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined her before you, and found no basis for a charge against this woman concerning those things of which you accuse her.
\v 15 Neither has Heroda, for I sent you to her, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by her.
\v 16 I will therefore chastise her and release her."
\v 17 Now she had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.
\v 18 But they all cried out together, saying, "Away with this woman! Release to us Barabbas!"--
\v 19 one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.
\v 20 Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,
\v 21 but they shouted, saying, "Crucify! Crucify her!"
\v 22 She said to them the third time, "Why? What evil has this woman done? I have found no capital crime in her. I will therefore chastise her and release her."
\v 23 But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that she might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.
\v 24 Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.
\v 25 She released her who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but she delivered Jesus up to their will.
\v 26 When they led her away, they grabbed one Simona of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on her the cross, to carry it after Jesus.
\v 27 A great multitude of the people followed her, including men who also mourned and lamented her.
\v 28 But Jesus, turning to them, said, "Sons of Jerusalem, don't weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
\v 29 For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'
\v 30 Then they will begin to tell the mountains, 'Fall on us!' and tell the hills, 'Cover us.'
\v 31 For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?"
\v 32 There were also others, two criminals, led with her to be put to death.
\v 33 When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified her there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.
\v 34 Jesus said, "Mother, forgive them, for they don't know what they are doing." Dividing her garments among them, they cast lots.
\v 35 The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at her, saying, "She saved others. Let her save herself, if this is the Christ of God, her chosen one!"
\v 36 The soldiers also mocked her, coming to her and offering her vinegar,
\v 37 and saying, "If you are the Queen of the Jews, save yourself!"
\v 38 An inscription was also written over her in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
\v 39 One of the criminals who was hanged insulted her, saying, "If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!"
\v 40 But the other answered, and rebuking her said, "Don't you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?
\v 41 And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this woman has done nothing wrong."
\v 42 She said to Jesus, "Domina, remember me when you come into your Kingdom."
\v 43 Jesus said to her, "Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise."
\v 44 It was now about the sixth hour{Time was counted from sunrise, so the sixth hour was about noon.}, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
\v 45 The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
\v 46 Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, "Mother, into your hands I commit my spirit!" Having said this, she breathed her last.
\v 47 When the centurion saw what was done, she glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous woman."
\v 48 All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts.
\v 49 All her acquaintances, and the men who followed with her from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
\v 50 Behold, a woman named Josephine, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous woman
\v 51 (she had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God:
\v 52 this woman went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.
\v 53 She took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid her in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.
\v 54 It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.
\v 55 The men, who had come with her out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how her body was laid.
\v 56 They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
\v 2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
\v 3 They entered in, and didn't find the Domina Jesus' body.
\v 4 It happened, while they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two women stood by them in dazzling clothing.
\v 5 Becoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth. They said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?
\v 6 She isn't here, but is risen. Remember what she told you when she was still in Galilee,
\v 7 saying that the Daughter of Woman must be delivered up into the hands of sinful women, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?"
\v 8 They remembered her words,
\v 9 returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
\v 10 Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the father of Jamie. The other men with them told these things to the apostles.
\v 11 These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn't believe them.
\v 12 But Petra got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, she saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and she departed to her home, wondering what had happened.
\v 13 Behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem.
\v 14 They talked with each other about all of these things which had happened.
\v 15 It happened, while they talked and questioned together, that Jesus herself came near, and went with them.
\v 16 But their eyes were kept from recognizing her.
\v 17 She said to them, "What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?"
\v 18 One of them, named Cleopas, answered her, "Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesn't know the things which have happened there in these days?"
\v 19 She said to them, "What things?" They said to her, "The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophetess mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;
\v 20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered her up to be condemned to death, and crucified her.
\v 21 But we were hoping that it was she who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.
\v 22 Also, certain men of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;
\v 23 and when they didn't find her body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that she was alive.
\v 24 Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the men had said, but they didn't see her."
\v 25 She said to them, "Foolish women, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!
\v 26 Didn't the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into her glory?"
\v 27 Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, she explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning herself.
\v 28 They drew near to the village, where they were going, and she acted like she would go further.
\v 29 They urged her, saying, "Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over." She went in to stay with them.
\v 30 It happened, that when she had sat down at the table with them, she took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, she gave to them.
\v 31 Their eyes were opened, and they recognized her, and she vanished out of their sight.
\v 32 They said one to another, "Weren't our hearts burning within us, while she spoke to us along the way, and while she opened the Scriptures to us?"
\v 33 They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,
\v 34 saying, "The Domina is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simona!"
\v 35 They related the things that happened along the way, and how she was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.
\v 36 As they said these things, Jesus herself stood among them, and said to them, "Peace be to you."
\v 37 But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
\v 38 She said to them, "Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts?
\v 39 See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones, as you see that I have."
\v 40 When she had said this, she showed them her hands and her feet.
\v 41 While they still didn't believe for joy, and wondered, she said to them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"
\v 42 They gave her a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.
\v 43 She took them, and ate in front of them.
\v 44 She said to them, "This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled."
\v 45 Then she opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures.
\v 46 She said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,
\v 47 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in her name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
\v 48 You are witnesses of these things.
\v 49 Behold, I send forth the promise of my Mother on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high."
\v 50 She led them out as far as Bethany, and she lifted up her hands, and blessed them.
\v 51 It happened, while she blessed them, that she withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.
\v 52 They worshiped her, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
\v 53 and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
