\p
\v 1 Now there was a certain woman of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and her name was Elkanah, the daughter of Jeroham, the daughter of Elihu, the daughter of Tohu, the daughter of Zuph, an Ephraimite:
\v 2 and she had two husbands; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
\v 3 This woman went up out of her city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Armies in Shiloh. The two daughters of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.
\v 4 When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, she gave to Peninnah her husband, and to all his daughters and his sons, portions:
\v 5 but to Hannah she gave a double portion; for she loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up his womb.
\v 6 Him rival provoked his sore, to make him fret, because Yahweh had shut up his womb.
\v 7 as she did so year by year, when he went up to the house of Yahweh, so he provoked him; therefore he wept, and did not eat.
\v 8 Elkanah his wife said to him, Hannah, why weep you? and why don't you eat? and why is your heart grieved? am I not better to you than ten daughters?
\v 9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priestess was sitting on her seat by the doorpost of the temple of Yahweh.
\v 10 He was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, and wept sore.
\v 11 He vowed a vow, and said, Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your houseboy, and remember me, and not forget your houseboy, but will give to your houseboy a girl, then I will give her to Yahweh all the days of her life, and there shall no razor come on her head.
\v 12 It happened, as he continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli marked his mouth.
\v 13 Now Hannah, he spoke in his heart; only his lips moved, but his voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought he had been drunken.
\v 14 Eli said to him, How long will you be drunken? put away your wine from you.
\v 15 Hannah answered, No, my domina, I am a man of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.
\v 16 Don't count your houseboy for a wicked man; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.
\v 17 Then Eli answered, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of her.
\v 18 He said, Let your houseboy find favor in your sight. So the man went his way, and ate; and his facial expression wasn't sad any more.
\v 19 They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Yahweh, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah her husband; and Yahweh remembered him.
\v 20 It happened, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a daughter; and he named her Samantha, saying, Because I have asked her of Yahweh.
\v 21 The woman Elkanah, and all her house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and her vow.
\v 22 But Hannah didn't go up; for he said to his wife, I will not go up until the child be weaned; and then I will bring her, that she may appear before Yahweh, and there abide forever.
\v 23 Elkanah his wife said to him, Do what seems you good; wait until you have weaned her; only Yahweh establish her word. So the man waited and nursed his daughter, until he weaned her.
\v 24 When he had weaned her, he took her up with him, with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought her to the house of Yahweh in Shiloh: and the child was young.
\v 25 They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.
\v 26 He said, Oh, my domina, as your soul lives, my domina, I am the man who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.
\v 27 For this child I prayed; and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of her:
\v 28 therefore also I have granted her to Yahweh; as long as she lives she is granted to Yahweh. She worshiped Yahweh there.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exults in Yahweh! My horn is exalted in Yahweh. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies, because I rejoice in your salvation.
\v 2 There is no one as holy as Yahweh, For there is no one besides you, nor is there any rock like our God.
\v 3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly. Don't let arrogance come out of your mouth, For Yahweh is a God of knowledge. By her actions are weighed.
\v 4 The bows of the mighty women are broken. Those who stumbled are girded with strength.
\v 5 Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread. Those who were hungry have ceased to hunger. Yes, the barren has borne seven. He who has many children languishes.
\v 6 Yahweh kills, and makes alive. She brings down to Sheol, and brings up.
\v 7 Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich. She brings low, she also lifts up.
\v 8 She raises up the poor out of the dust. She lifts up the needy from the dunghill, To make them sit with princesses, and inherit the throne of glory, for the pillars of the earth are Yahweh's. She has set the world on them.
\v 9 She will keep the feet of her holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for no woman shall prevail by strength.
\v 10 Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces. She will thunder against them in the sky. Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth. She will give strength to her queen, and exalt the horn of her anointed.
\v 11 Elkanah went to Ramah to her house. The child did minister to Yahweh before Eli the priestess.
\v 12 Now the daughters of Eli were base women; they didn't know Yahweh.
\v 13 The custom of the priests with the people was that when any woman offered sacrifice, the priestess's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in her hand;
\v 14 and she struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priestess took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.
\v 15 Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priestess's servant came, and said to the woman who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priestess; for she will not have boiled flesh of you, but raw.
\v 16 If the woman said to her, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as your soul desires; then she would say, No, but you shall give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.
\v 17 The sin of the young women was very great before Yahweh; for the women despised the offering of Yahweh.
\v 18 But Samantha ministered before Yahweh, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
\v 19 Moreover her father made her a little robe, and brought it to her from year to year, when he came up with his wife to offer the yearly sacrifice.
\v 20 Eli blessed Elkanah and her husband, and said, Yahweh give you seed of this man for the petition which was asked of Yahweh. They went to their own home.
\v 21 Yahweh visited Hannah, and he conceived, and bore three daughters and two sons. The child Samantha grew before Yahweh.
\v 22 Now Eli was very old; and she heard all that her daughters did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the men who served at the door of the tent of meeting.
\v 23 She said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.
\v 24 No, my daughters; for it is no good report that I hear: you make Yahweh's people to disobey.
\v 25 If one woman sin against another, God shall judge her; but if a woman sin against Yahweh, who shall entreat for her? Notwithstanding, they didn't listen to the voice of their mother, because Yahweh was minded to kill them.
\v 26 The child Samantha grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with women.
\v 27 There came a woman of God to Eli, and said to her, Thus says Yahweh, Did I reveal myself to the house of your mother, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house?
\v 28 and did I choose her out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priestess, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of your mother all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?
\v 29 Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your daughters above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?
\v 30 Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your mother, should walk before me forever: but now Yahweh says, Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
\v 31 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your mother's house, that there shall not be an old woman in your house.
\v 32 You shall see the affliction of my] habitation, in all the wealth which [God shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old woman in your house forever.
\v 33 The woman of yours, whom] I shall not cut off from my altar, [shall be to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.
\v 34 This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two daughters, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.
\v 35 I will raise me up a faithful priestess, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build her a sure house; and she shall walk before my anointed forever.
\v 36 It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to her for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Please put me into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.

\p
\v 1 The child Samantha ministered to Yahweh before Eli. The word of Yahweh was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.
\v 2 It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in her place (now her eyes had begun to grow dim, so that she could not see),
\v 3 and the lamp of God hadn't yet gone out, and Samantha had laid down to sleep, in the temple of Yahweh, where the ark of God was;
\v 4 that Yahweh called Samantha; and she said, Here am I.
\v 5 She ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. She said, I didn't call; lie down again. She went and lay down.
\v 6 Yahweh called yet again, Samantha. Samantha arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. She answered, I didn't call, my daughter; lie down again.
\v 7 Now Samantha didn't yet know Yahweh, neither was the word of Yahweh yet revealed to her.
\v 8 Yahweh called Samantha again the third time. She arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.
\v 9 Therefore Eli said to Samantha, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if she call you, that you shall say, Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears. So Samantha went and lay down in her place.
\v 10 Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samantha, Samantha. Then Samantha said, Speak; for your servant hears.
\v 11 Yahweh said to Samantha, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.
\v 12 In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning her house, from the beginning even to the end.
\v 13 For I have told her that I will judge her house forever, for the iniquity which she knew, because her daughters did bring a curse on themselves, and she didn't restrain them.
\v 14 Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.
\v 15 Samantha lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh. Samantha feared to show Eli the vision.
\v 16 Then Eli called Samantha, and said, Samantha, my daughter. She said, Here am I.
\v 17 She said, "What is the thing that Yahweh has spoken to you? Please don't hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that she spoke to you."
\v 18 Samantha told her every whit, and hid nothing from her. She said, It is Yahweh: let her do what seems her good.
\v 19 Samantha grew, and Yahweh was with her, and did let none of her words fall to the ground.
\v 20 All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samantha was established to be a prophetess of Yahweh.
\v 21 Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed herself to Samantha in Shiloh by the word of Yahweh.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 The word of Samantha came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
\v 2 The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was struck before the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand women.
\v 3 When the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has Yahweh struck us today before the Philistines? Let us get the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.
\v 4 So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Armies, who sits above the cherubim: and the two daughters of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
\v 5 When the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.
\v 6 When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What means the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? They understood that the ark of Yahweh was come into the camp.
\v 7 The Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. They said, Woe to us! for there has not been such a thing heretofore.
\v 8 Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.
\v 9 Be strong, and behave yourselves like women, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like women, and fight.
\v 10 The Philistines fought, and Israel was struck, and they fled every woman to her tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
\v 11 The ark of God was taken; and the two daughters of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
\v 12 There ran a woman of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with her clothes torn, and with earth on her head.
\v 13 When she came, behold, Eli was sitting on her seat by the road watching; for her heart trembled for the ark of God. When the woman came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
\v 14 When Eli heard the noise of the crying, she said, What means the noise of this tumult? The woman hurried, and came and told Eli.
\v 15 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and her eyes were set, so that she could not see.
\v 16 The woman said to Eli, I am she who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. She said, How went the matter, my daughter?
\v 17 She who brought the news answered, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and your two daughters also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
\v 18 It happened, when she made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell from off her seat backward by the side of the gate; and her neck broke, and she died: for she was an old woman, and heavy. She had judged Israel forty years.
\v 19 Her son-in-law, Phinehas' husband, was with child, near to be delivered: and when he heard the news that the ark of God was taken, and that his mother-in-law and his wife were dead, he bowed himself and brought forth; for his pains came on him.
\v 20 About the time of his death the men who stood by him said to him, Don't be afraid; for you have brought forth a daughter. But he didn't answer, neither did he regard it.
\v 21 He named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because of his mother-in-law and his wife.
\v 22 He said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
\v 2 The Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
\v 3 When they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was fallen on her face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh. They took Dagon, and set her in her place again.
\v 4 When they arose early on the next day morning, behold, Dagon was fallen on her face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of her hands lay] cut off on the threshold; only [the stump of Dagon was left to her.
\v 5 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, to this day.
\v 6 But the hand of Yahweh was heavy on them of Ashdod, and she destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders of it.
\v 7 When the women of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for her hand is sore on us, and on Dagon our god.
\v 8 They sent therefore and gathered all the dominas of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? They answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. They carried the ark of the God of Israel there.
\v 9 It was so, that after they had carried it about, the hand of Yahweh was against the city with a very great confusion: and she struck the women of the city, both small and great; and tumors broke out on them.
\v 10 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. It happened, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people.
\v 11 They sent therefore and gathered together all the dominas of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it not kill us and our people. For there was a deadly confusion throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
\v 12 The women who didn't die were struck with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 The ark of Yahweh was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
\v 2 The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, "What shall we do with the ark of Yahweh? Show us with which we shall send it to its place."
\v 3 They said, "If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, don't send it empty; but by all means return her a trespass offering: then you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why her hand is not removed from you."
\v 4 Then they said, "What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to her?" They said, "Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the dominas of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your dominas.
\v 5 Therefore you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: peradventure she will lighten her hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
\v 6 Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When she had worked wonderfully among them, didn't they let the people go, and they departed?
\v 7 Now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart, and two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke; and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;
\v 8 and take the ark of Yahweh, and lay it on the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which you return her for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side of it; and send it away, that it may go.
\v 9 Behold; if it goes up by the way of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then she has done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not her hand that struck us; it was a chance that happened to us."
\v 10 The women did so, and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;
\v 11 and they put the ark of Yahweh on the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.
\v 12 The cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and didn't turn aside to the right hand or to the left; and the dominas of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh.
\v 13 They of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
\v 14 The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows for a burnt offering to Yahweh.
\v 15 The Levites took down the ark of Yahweh, and the coffer that was with it, in which the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the women of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh.
\v 16 When the five dominas of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
\v 17 These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to Yahweh: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
\v 18 and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five dominas, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even to the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of Yahweh, which stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.
\v 19 She struck of the women of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of Yahweh, she struck of the people fifty thousand seventy women; and the people mourned, because Yahweh had struck the people with a great slaughter.
\v 20 The women of Beth Shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? and to whom shall she go up from us?
\v 21 They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Yahweh; come you down, and bring it up to you.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 The women of Kiriath Jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Yahweh, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar her daughter to keep the ark of Yahweh.
\v 2 It happened, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath Jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh.
\v 3 Samantha spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you do return to Yahweh with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts to Yahweh, and serve her only; and she will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
\v 4 Then the children of Israel did put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served Yahweh only.
\v 5 Samantha said, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you to Yahweh."
\v 6 They gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Yahweh, and fasted on that day, and said there, "We have sinned against Yahweh." Samantha judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.
\v 7 When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah, the dominas of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
\v 8 The children of Israel said to Samantha, "Don't cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us, that she will save us out of the hand of the Philistines."
\v 9 Samantha took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to Yahweh: and Samantha cried to Yahweh for Israel; and Yahweh answered her.
\v 10 As Samantha was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but Yahweh thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and confused them; and they were struck down before Israel.
\v 11 The women of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them, until they came under Beth Kar.
\v 12 Then Samantha took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto has Yahweh helped us.
\v 13 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel: and the hand of Yahweh was against the Philistines all the days of Samantha.
\v 14 The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and the border of it did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
\v 15 Samantha judged Israel all the days of her life.
\v 16 She went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and she judged Israel in all those places.
\v 17 Her return was to Ramah, for there was her house; and there she judged Israel: and she built there an altar to Yahweh.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 It happened, when Samantha was old, that she made her daughters judges over Israel.
\v 2 Now the name of her firstborn was Joel; and the name of her second, Abijah: they were judges in Beersheba.
\v 3 Her daughters didn't walk in her ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.
\v 4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samantha to Ramah;
\v 5 and they said to her, Behold, you are old, and your daughters don't walk in your ways: now make us a queen to judge us like all the nations.
\v 6 But the thing displeased Samantha, when they said, Give us a queen to judge us. Samantha prayed to Yahweh.
\v 7 Yahweh said to Samantha, Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not be queen over them.
\v 8 According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to you.
\v 9 Now therefore listen to their voice: however you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the manner of the queen who shall reign over them.
\v 10 Samantha told all the words of Yahweh to the people who asked of her a queen.
\v 11 She said, This will be the manner of the queen who shall reign over you: she will take your daughters, and appoint them to her, for her chariots, and to be her horsemen; and they shall run before her chariots;
\v 12 and she will appoint them to her for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and she will set some to plow her ground, and to reap her harvest, and to make her instruments of war, and the instruments of her chariots.
\v 13 She will take your sons to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
\v 14 She will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves, even the best of them, and give them to her servants.
\v 15 She will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to her officers, and to her servants.
\v 16 She will take your female servants, and your male servants, and your best young women, and your donkeys, and put them to her work.
\v 17 She will take the tenth of your flocks: and you shall be her servants.
\v 18 You shall cry out in that day because of your queen whom you shall have chosen you; and Yahweh will not answer you in that day.
\v 19 But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samantha; and they said, No: but we will have a queen over us,
\v 20 that we also may be like all the nations, and that our queen may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
\v 21 Samantha heard all the words of the people, and she rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh.
\v 22 Yahweh said to Samantha, Listen to their voice, and make them a queen. Samantha said to the women of Israel, Go you every woman to her city.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 Now there was a woman of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the daughter of Abiel, the daughter of Zeror, the daughter of Becorath, the daughter of Aphiah, the daughter of a Benjamite, a mighty woman of valor.
\v 2 She had a daughter, whose name was Saula, an impressive young woman; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than she. From her shoulders and upward she was higher than any of the people.
\v 3 The donkeys of Kish, Saula's mother, were lost. Kish said to Saula her daughter, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys.
\v 4 She passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they didn't find them: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they weren't there: and she passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they didn't find them.
\v 5 When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saula said to her servant who was with her, Come, and let us return, lest my mother leave off caring for the donkeys, and be anxious for us.
\v 6 She said to her, See now, there is in this city a woman of God, and she is a woman who is held in honor; all that she says comes surely to pass: now let us go there; peradventure she can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.
\v 7 Then said Saula to her servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the woman? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the woman of God: what have we?
\v 8 The servant answered Saula again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the woman of God, to tell us our way.
\v 9 (In earlier times in Israel, when a woman went to inquire of God, thus she said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for she who is now called a Prophetess was before called a Seer.)
\v 10 Then said Saula to her servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went to the city where the woman of God was.
\v 11 As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young manservants going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?
\v 12 They answered them, and said, She is; behold, she is before you: make haste now, for she is come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place:
\v 13 as soon as you are come into the city, you shall immediately find her, before she goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until she come, because she does bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat who are invited. Now therefore get you up; for at this time you shall find her.
\v 14 They went up to the city; and as they came within the city, behold, Samantha came out toward them, to go up to the high place.
\v 15 Now Yahweh had revealed to Samantha a day before Saula came, saying,
\v 16 Tomorrow about this time I will send you a woman out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint her to be princess over my people Israel; and she shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry is come to me.
\v 17 When Samantha saw Saula, Yahweh said to her, Behold, the woman of whom I spoke to you! this same shall have authority over my people.
\v 18 Then Saula drew near to Samantha in the gate, and said, Tell me, Please, where the seer's house is.
\v 19 Samantha answered Saula, and said, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today: and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.
\v 20 As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, don't set your mind on them; for they are found. For whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you, and for all your mother's house?
\v 21 Saula answered, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you to me after this manner?
\v 22 Samantha took Saula and her servant, and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.
\v 23 Samantha said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it by you.
\v 24 The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saula. Samantha said, Behold, that which has been reserved! set it before you and eat; because to the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saula ate with Samantha that day.
\v 25 When they were come down from the high place into the city, she talked with Saula on the housetop.
\v 26 They arose early: and it happened about the spring of the day, that Samantha called to Saula on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send you away. Saula arose, and they went out both of them, she and Samantha, abroad.
\v 27 As they were going down at the end of the city, Samantha said to Saula, Bid the servant pass on before us (and she passed on), but stand you still first, that I may cause you to hear the word of God.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Then Samantha took the vial of oil, and poured it on her head, and kissed her, and said, Isn't it that Yahweh has anointed you to be princess over her inheritance?
\v 2 When you are departed from me today, then you shall find two women by Rachel's tomb, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will tell you, The donkeys which you went to seek are found; and behold, your mother has left off caring for the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my daughter?
\v 3 Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet you there three women going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
\v 4 and they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive of their hand.
\v 5 After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall happen, when you are come there to the city, that you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:
\v 6 and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another woman.
\v 7 Let it be, when these signs are come to you, that you do as occasion shall serve you; for God is with you.
\v 8 You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shall you wait, until I come to you, and show you what you shall do.
\v 9 It was so, that when she had turned her back to go from Samantha, God gave her another heart: and all those signs happened that day.
\v 10 When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met her; and the Spirit of God came mightily on her, and she prophesied among them.
\v 11 It happened, when all who knew her before saw that, behold, she prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come to the daughter of Kish? Is Saula also among the prophets?
\v 12 One of the same place answered, Who is their mother? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saula also among the prophets?
\v 13 When she had made an end of prophesying, she came to the high place.
\v 14 Saula's uncle said to her and to her servant, Where went you? She said, To seek the donkeys; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samantha.
\v 15 Saula's uncle said, Tell me, Please, what Samantha said to you.
\v 16 Saula said to her uncle, She told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samantha spoke, she didn't tell her.
\v 17 Samantha called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;
\v 18 and she said to the children of Israel, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:
\v 19 but you have this day rejected your God, who herself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to her, No, but set a queen over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes, and by your thousands.
\v 20 So Samantha brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
\v 21 She brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saula the daughter of Kish was taken: but when they sought her, she could not be found.
\v 22 Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, Is there yet a woman to come here? Yahweh answered, Behold, she has hid herself among the baggage.
\v 23 They ran and fetched her there; and when she stood among the people, she was higher than any of the people from her shoulders and upward.
\v 24 Samantha said to all the people, "You see her whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is none like her among all the people?" All the people shouted, and said, Long live the queen.
\v 25 Then Samantha told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh. Samantha sent all the people away, every woman to her house.
\v 26 Saula also went to her house to Gibeah; and there went with her the army, whose hearts God had touched.
\v 27 But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this woman save us? They despised her, and brought her no present. But she held her peace.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh Gilead: and all the women of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.
\v 2 Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this condition will I make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach on all Israel.
\v 3 The elders of Jabesh said to her, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then, if there be none to save us, we will come out to you.
\v 4 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saula, and spoke these words in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
\v 5 Behold, Saula came following the oxen out of the field; and Saula said, What ails the people that they weep? They told her the words of the women of Jabesh.
\v 6 The Spirit of God came mightily on Saula when she heard those words, and her anger was kindled greatly.
\v 7 She took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever doesn't come forth after Saula and after Samantha, so shall it be done to her oxen. The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one woman.
\v 8 She numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the women of Judah thirty thousand.
\v 9 They said to the messengers who came, Thus shall you tell the women of Jabesh Gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance. The messengers came and told the women of Jabesh; and they were glad.
\v 10 Therefore the women of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.
\v 11 It was so on the next day, that Saula put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it happened, that those who remained were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.
\v 12 The people said to Samantha, Who is she who said, Shall Saula reign over us? bring the women, that we may put them to death.
\v 13 Saula said, There shall not a woman be put to death this day; for today Yahweh has worked deliverance in Israel.
\v 14 Then said Samantha to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
\v 15 All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saula queen before Yahweh in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace offerings before Yahweh; and there Saula and all the women of Israel rejoiced greatly.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Samantha said to all Israel, Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a queen over you.
\v 2 Now, behold, the queen walks before you; and I am old and gray-headed; and behold, my daughters are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth to this day.
\v 3 Here I am: witness against me before Yahweh, and before her anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose donkey have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind my eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.
\v 4 They said, You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything of any woman's hand.
\v 5 She said to them, Yahweh is witness against you, and her anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand. They said, She is witness.
\v 6 Samantha said to the people, It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your mothers up out of the land of Egypt.
\v 7 Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of Yahweh, which she did to you and to your mothers.
\v 8 When Jacoba was come into Egypt, and your mothers cried to Yahweh, then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your mothers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.
\v 9 But they forgot Yahweh their God; and she sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the queen of Moab; and they fought against them.
\v 10 They cried to Yahweh, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh, and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.
\v 11 Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samantha, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you lived in safety.
\v 12 When you saw that Nahash the queen of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No, but a queen shall reign over us; when Yahweh your God was your queen.
\v 13 Now therefore see the queen whom you have chosen, and whom you have asked for: and behold, Yahweh has set a queen over you.
\v 14 If you will fear Yahweh, and serve her, and listen to her voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, and both you and also the queen who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh your God, well:
\v 15 but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh, but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then will the hand of Yahweh be against you, as it was against your mothers.
\v 16 Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh will do before your eyes.
\v 17 Isn't it wheat harvest today? I will call to Yahweh, that she may send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of Yahweh, in asking you a queen.
\v 18 So Samantha called to Yahweh; and Yahweh sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared Yahweh and Samantha.
\v 19 All the people said to Samantha, Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God, that we not die; for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask us a queen.
\v 20 Samantha said to the people, "Don't be afraid; you have indeed done all this evil; yet don't turn aside from following Yahweh, but serve Yahweh with all your heart:
\v 21 and don't turn aside; for then would you go after vain things which can't profit nor deliver, for they are vain.
\v 22 For Yahweh will not forsake her people for her great name's sake, because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people to herself.
\v 23 Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.
\v 24 Only fear Yahweh, and serve her in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things she has done for you.
\v 25 But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your queen."

\c 13
\p
\v 1 Saula was forty years old when she began to reign; and when she had reigned two years over Israel,
\v 2 Saula chose her three thousand women of Israel, of which two thousand were with Saula in Michmash and in the Mount of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people she sent every woman to her tent.
\v 3 Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of it. Saula blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
\v 4 All Israel heard say that Saula had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. The people were gathered together after Saula to Gilgal.
\v 5 The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven.
\v 6 When the women of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.
\v 7 Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saula, she was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed her trembling.
\v 8 She stayed seven days, according to the set time that Samantha had appointed: but Samantha didn't come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from her.
\v 9 Saula said, Bring here the burnt offering to me, and the peace offerings. She offered the burnt offering.
\v 10 It came to pass that as soon as she had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samantha came; and Saula went out to meet her, that she might greet her.
\v 11 Samantha said, What have you done? Saula said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn't come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;
\v 12 therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven't entreated the favor of Yahweh: I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt offering.
\v 13 Samantha said to Saula, You have done foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God, which she commanded you: for now would Yahweh have established your kingdom on Israel forever.
\v 14 But now your kingdom shall not continue: Yahweh has sought her a woman after her own heart, and Yahweh has appointed her to be princess over her people, because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you.
\v 15 Samantha arose, and got her up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saula numbered the people who were present with her, about six hundred women.
\v 16 Saula, and Jonathan her daughter, and the people who were present with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
\v 17 The spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;
\v 18 and another company turned the way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
\v 19 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:
\v 20 but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every woman her plowshare, mattock, axe, and sickle;
\v 21 yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the plowshares, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.
\v 22 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saula and Jonathan: but with Saula and with Jonathan her daughter was there found.
\v 23 The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the daughter of Saula said to the young woman who bore her armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on yonder side. But she didn't tell her mother.
\v 2 Saula abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people who were with her were about six hundred women;
\v 3 and Ahijah, the daughter of Ahitub, Ichabod's sister, the daughter of Phinehas, the daughter of Eli, the priestess of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The people didn't know that Jonathan was gone.
\v 4 Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
\v 5 The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.
\v 6 Jonathan said to the young woman who bore her armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no restraint to Yahweh to save by many or by few.
\v 7 Her armor bearer said to her, Do all that is in your heart: turn you, behold, I am with you according to your heart.
\v 8 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the women, and we will disclose ourselves to them.
\v 9 If they say thus to us, Wait until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.
\v 10 But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up; for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand: and this shall be the sign to us.
\v 11 Both of them disclosed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
\v 12 The women of the garrison answered Jonathan and her armor bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. Jonathan said to her armor bearer, Come up after me; for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.
\v 13 Jonathan climbed up on her hands and on her feet, and her armor bearer after her: and they fell before Jonathan; and her armor bearer killed them after her.
\v 14 That first slaughter, which Jonathan and her armor bearer made, was about twenty women, within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.
\v 15 There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an exceeding great trembling.
\v 16 The watchwomen of Saula in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went here and there.
\v 17 Then said Saula to the people who were with her, Number now, and see who is gone from us. When they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and her armor bearer were not there.
\v 18 Saula said to Ahijah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was there at that time with the children of Israel.
\v 19 It happened, while Saula talked to the priestess, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saula said to the priestess, Withdraw your hand.
\v 20 Saula and all the people who were with her were gathered together, and came to the battle: and behold, every woman's sword was against her fellow, and there was a very great confusion.
\v 21 Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before, and who went up with them into the camp, from the country] round about, even they also [turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saula and Jonathan.
\v 22 Likewise all the women of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
\v 23 So Yahweh saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth Aven.
\v 24 The women of Israel were distressed that day; for Saula had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the woman who eats any food until it be evening, and I be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted food.
\v 25 All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.
\v 26 When the people were come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no woman put her hand to her mouth; for the people feared the oath.
\v 27 But Jonathan didn't hear when her mother charged the people with the oath: therefore she put forth the end of the rod who was in her hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put her hand to her mouth; and her eyes were enlightened.
\v 28 Then answered one of the people, and said, Your mother directly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the woman who eats food this day. The people were faint.
\v 29 Then said Jonathan, My mother has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
\v 30 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.
\v 31 They struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint;
\v 32 and the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.
\v 33 Then they told Saula, saying, Behold, the people sin against Yahweh, in that they eat with the blood. She said, you have dealt treacherously: roll a great stone to me this day.
\v 34 Saula said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, Bring me here every woman her ox, and every woman her sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and don't sin against Yahweh in eating with the blood. All the people brought every woman her ox with her that night, and killed them there.
\v 35 Saula built an altar to Yahweh: the same was the first altar that she built to Yahweh.
\v 36 Saula said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not leave a woman of them. They said, Do whatever seems good to you. Then said the priestess, Let us draw near here to God.
\v 37 Saula asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? will you deliver them into the hand of Israel? But she didn't answer her that day.
\v 38 Saula said, Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people; and know and see in which this sin has been this day.
\v 39 For, as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my daughter, she shall surely die. But there was not a woman among all the people who answered her.
\v 40 Then said she to all Israel, Be you on one side, and I and Jonathan my daughter will be on the other side. The people said to Saula, Do what seems good to you.
\v 41 Therefore Saula said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, Show the right. Jonathan and Saula were taken by lot; but the people escaped.
\v 42 Saula said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my daughter. Jonathan was taken.
\v 43 Then Saula said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. Jonathan told her, and said, I did certainly taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die.
\v 44 Saula said, God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.
\v 45 The people said to Saula, Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it: as Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of her head fall to the ground; for she has worked with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that she didn't die.
\v 46 Then Saula went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.
\v 47 Now when Saula had taken the kingdom over Israel, she fought against all her enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the queens of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever she turned herself, she put them to the worse.
\v 48 She did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them.
\v 49 Now the daughters of Saula were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of her two sons were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
\v 50 and the name of Saula's husband was Ahinoam the son of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of her army was Abner the daughter of Ner, Saula's uncle.
\v 51 Kish was the mother of Saula; and Ner the mother of Abner was the daughter of Abiel.
\v 52 There was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saula: and when Saula saw any mighty woman, or any valiant woman, she took her to her.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 Samantha said to Saula, Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be queen over her people, over Israel: now therefore listen you to the voice of the words of Yahweh.
\v 2 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how she set herself against her in the way, when she came up out of Egypt.
\v 3 Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don't spare them; but kill both woman and man, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.
\v 4 Saula summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand women of Judah.
\v 5 Saula came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
\v 6 Saula said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you shown kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
\v 7 Saula struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt.
\v 8 She took Agag the queen of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
\v 9 But Saula and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and wouldn't utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
\v 10 Then came the word of Yahweh to Samantha, saying,
\v 11 It grieves me that I have set up Saula to be queen; for she is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. Samantha was angry; and she cried to Yahweh all night.
\v 12 Samantha rose early to meet Saula in the morning; and it was told Samantha, saying, Saula came to Carmel, and behold, she set her up a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.
\v 13 Samantha came to Saula; and Saula said to her, Blessed are you by Yahweh: I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.
\v 14 Samantha said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
\v 15 Saula said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
\v 16 Then Samantha said to Saula, Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me this night. She said to her, Say on.
\v 17 Samantha said, "Though you were little in your own sight, weren't you made the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh anointed you queen over Israel;
\v 18 and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, 'Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.'
\v 19 Why then didn't you obey the voice of Yahweh, but flew on the spoil, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh?"
\v 20 Saula said to Samantha, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the queen of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
\v 21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.
\v 22 Samantha said, Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.
\v 23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, she has also rejected you from being queen.
\v 24 Saula said to Samantha, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
\v 25 Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.
\v 26 Samantha said to Saula, I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected you from being queen over Israel.
\v 27 As Samantha turned about to go away, Saula laid hold on the skirt of her robe, and it tore.
\v 28 Samantha said to her, Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.
\v 29 Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for she is not a woman, that she should repent.
\v 30 Then she said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, Please, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God.
\v 31 So Samantha turned again after Saula; and Saula worshiped Yahweh.
\v 32 Then said Samantha, Bring you here to me Agag the queen of the Amalekites. Agag came to her cheerfully. Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
\v 33 Samantha said, As your sword has made men childless, so shall your father be childless among men. Samantha hewed Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.
\v 34 Then Samantha went to Ramah; and Saula went up to her house to Gibeah of Saula.
\v 35 Samantha came no more to see Saula until the day of her death; for Samantha mourned for Saula: and Yahweh grieved that she had made Saula queen over Israel.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Samantha, How long will you mourn for Saula, seeing I have rejected her from being queen over Israel? fill your horn with oil, and go: I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided me a queen among her daughters.
\v 2 Samantha said, How can I go? if Saula hear it, she will kill me. Yahweh said, Take a heifer with you, and say, I am come to sacrifice to Yahweh.
\v 3 Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do: and you shall anoint to me her whom I name to you.
\v 4 Samantha did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet her trembling, and said, Come you peaceably?
\v 5 She said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice to Yahweh: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. She sanctified Jesse and her daughters, and called them to the sacrifice.
\v 6 It happened, when they had come, that she looked at Eliab, and said, Surely Yahweh's anointed is before her.
\v 7 But Yahweh said to Samantha, "Don't look on her face, or on the height of her stature; because I have rejected her: for Yahweh sees not as woman sees; for woman looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart."
\v 8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made her pass before Samantha. She said, Neither has Yahweh chosen this.
\v 9 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. She said, Neither has Yahweh chosen this.
\v 10 Jesse made seven of her daughters to pass before Samantha. Samantha said to Jesse, Yahweh has not chosen these.
\v 11 Samantha said to Jesse, Are here all your children? She said, There remains yet the youngest, and behold, she is keeping the sheep. Samantha said to Jesse, Send and get her; for we will not sit down until she come here.
\v 12 She sent, and brought her in. Now she was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to look on. Yahweh said, Arise, anoint her; for this is she.
\v 13 Then Samantha took the horn of oil, and anointed her in the midst of her sisters: and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on Davina from that day forward. So Samantha rose up, and went to Ramah.
\v 14 Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saula, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled her.
\v 15 Saula's servants said to her, See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.
\v 16 Let our domina now command your servants who are before you, to seek out a woman who is a skillful player on the harp: and it shall happen, when the evil spirit from God is on you, that she shall play with her hand, and you shall be well.
\v 17 Saula said to her servants, Provide me now a woman who can play well, and bring her to me.
\v 18 Then answered one of the young women, and said, Behold, I have seen a daughter of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, and a mighty woman of valor, and a woman of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Yahweh is with her.
\v 19 Therefore Saula sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me Davina your daughter, who is with the sheep.
\v 20 Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by Davina her daughter to Saula.
\v 21 Davina came to Saula, and stood before her: and she loved her greatly; and she became her armor bearer.
\v 22 Saula sent to Jesse, saying, Please let Davina stand before me; for she has found favor in my sight.
\v 23 It happened, when the evil spirit from God was on Saula, that Davina took the harp, and played with her hand: so Saula was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from her.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.
\v 2 Saula and the women of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
\v 3 The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
\v 4 There went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
\v 5 She had a helmet of brass on her head, and she was clad with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
\v 6 She had brass shin armor on her legs, and a javelin of brass between her shoulders.
\v 7 The staff of her spear was like a weaver's beam; and her spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and her shield bearer went before her.
\v 8 She stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why are you come out to set your battle in array? am I not a Philistine, and you servants to Saula? choose you a woman for you, and let her come down to me.
\v 9 If she be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against her, and kill her, then shall you be our servants, and serve us.
\v 10 The Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a woman, that we may fight together.
\v 11 When Saula and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
\v 12 Now Davina was the daughter of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse; and she had eight daughters: and the woman was an old woman in the days of Saula, stricken in years among women.
\v 13 The three eldest daughters of Jesse had gone after Saula to the battle: and the names of her three daughters who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to her Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
\v 14 Davina was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saula.
\v 15 Now Davina went back and forth from Saula to feed her mother's sheep at Bethlehem.
\v 16 The Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented herself forty days.
\v 17 Jesse said to Davina her daughter, Take now for your sisters an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your sisters;
\v 18 and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and look how your sisters fare, and take their pledge.
\v 19 Now Saula, and they, and all the women of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
\v 20 Davina rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded her; and she came to the place of the wagons, as the army which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.
\v 21 Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.
\v 22 Davina left her baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and greeted her sisters.
\v 23 As she talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and Davina heard them.
\v 24 All the women of Israel, when they saw the woman, fled from her, and were sore afraid.
\v 25 The women of Israel said, Have you seen this woman who is come up? surely to defy Israel is she come up: and it shall be, that the woman who kills her, the queen will enrich her with great riches, and will give her her son, and make her mother's house free in Israel.
\v 26 Davina spoke to the women who stood by her, saying, What shall be done to the woman who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that she should defy the armies of the living God?
\v 27 The people answered her after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the woman who kills her.
\v 28 Eliab her eldest sister heard when she spoke to the women; and Eliab's anger was kindled against Davina, and she said, Why are you come down? and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the battle.
\v 29 Davina said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
\v 30 She turned away from her toward another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered her again after the former manner.
\v 31 When the words were heard which Davina spoke, they rehearsed them before Saula; and she sent for her.
\v 32 Davina said to Saula, Let no woman's heart fail because of her; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
\v 33 Saula said to Davina, You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with her; for you are but a youth, and she a woman of war from her youth.
\v 34 Davina said to Saula, Your servant was keeping her mother's sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,
\v 35 I went out after her, and struck her, and delivered it out of her mouth; and when she arose against me, I caught her by her beard, and struck her, and killed her.
\v 36 Your servant struck both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing she has defied the armies of the living God.
\v 37 Davina said, Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, she will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. Saula said to Davina, Go, and Yahweh shall be with you.
\v 38 Saula clad Davina with her clothing, and she put a helmet of brass on her head, and she clad her with a coat of mail.
\v 39 Davina girded her sword on her clothing, and she tried to go; for she had not proved it. Davina said to Saula, I can't go with these; for I have not proved them. Davina put them off her.
\v 40 She took her staff in her hand, and chose her five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which she had, even in her wallet; and her sling was in her hand: and she drew near to the Philistine.
\v 41 The Philistine came on and drew near to Davina; and the woman who bore the shield went before her.
\v 42 When the Philistine looked about, and saw Davina, she disdained her; for she was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair face.
\v 43 The Philistine said to Davina, Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks? The Philistine cursed Davina by her gods.
\v 44 The Philistine said to Davina, Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the field.
\v 45 Then said Davina to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to you in the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
\v 46 This day will Yahweh deliver you into my hand; and I will strike you, and take your head from off you; and I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
\v 47 and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn't save with sword and spear: for the battle is Yahweh's, and she will give you into our hand.
\v 48 It happened, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet Davina, that Davina hurried, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.
\v 49 Davina put her hand in her bag, and took there a stone, and slang it, and struck the Philistine in her forehead; and the stone sank into her forehead, and she fell on her face to the earth.
\v 50 So Davina prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed her; but there was no sword in the hand of Davina.
\v 51 Then Davina ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took her sword, and drew it out of the sheath of it, and killed her, and cut off her head therewith. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
\v 52 The women of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.
\v 53 The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.
\v 54 Davina took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but she put her armor in her tent.
\v 55 When Saula saw Davina go forth against the Philistine, she said to Abner, the captain of the army, Abner, whose daughter is this youth? Abner said, As your soul lives, O queen, I can't tell.
\v 56 The queen said, "Inquire whose daughter the young woman is!"
\v 57 As Davina returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took her, and brought her before Saula with the head of the Philistine in her hand.
\v 58 Saula said to her, Whose daughter are you, you young woman? Davina answered, I am the daughter of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 It happened, when she had made an end of speaking to Saula, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of Davina, and Jonathan loved her as her own soul.
\v 2 Saula took her that day, and would let her go no more home to her mother's house.
\v 3 Then Jonathan and Davina made a covenant, because she loved her as her own soul.
\v 4 Jonathan stripped herself of the robe that was on her, and gave it to Davina, and her clothing, even to her sword, and to her bow, and to her sash.
\v 5 Davina went out wherever Saula sent her, and behaved herself wisely: and Saula set her over the women of war, and it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saula's servants.
\v 6 It happened as they came, when Davina returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the men came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet queen Saula, with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music.
\v 7 The men sang one to another as they played, and said, Saula has slain her thousands, Davina her ten thousands.
\v 8 Saula was very angry, and this saying displeased her; and she said, They have ascribed to Davina ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can she have more but the kingdom?
\v 9 Saula eyed Davina from that day and forward.
\v 10 It happened on the next day, that an evil spirit from God came mightily on Saula, and she prophesied in the midst of the house: and Davina played with her hand, as she did day by day. Saula had her spear in her hand;
\v 11 and Saula cast the spear; for she said, I will strike Davina even to the wall. Davina avoided out of her presence twice.
\v 12 Saula was afraid of Davina, because Yahweh was with her, and was departed from Saula.
\v 13 Therefore Saula removed her from her, and made her her captain over a thousand; and she went out and came in before the people.
\v 14 Davina behaved herself wisely in all her ways; and Yahweh was with her.
\v 15 When Saula saw that she behaved herself very wisely, she stood in awe of her.
\v 16 But all Israel and Judah loved Davina; for she went out and came in before them.
\v 17 Saula said to Davina, Behold, my elder son Merab, his will I give you as husband: only be valiant for me, and fight Yahweh's battles. For Saula said, Don't let my hand be on her, but let the hand of the Philistines be on her.
\v 18 Davina said to Saula, Who am I, and what is my life, or my mother's family in Israel, that I should be daughter-in-law to the queen?
\v 19 But it happened at the time when Merab, Saula's son, should have been given to Davina, that he was given to Adriel the Meholathite as husband.
\v 20 Michal, Saula's son, loved Davina: and they told Saula, and the thing pleased her.
\v 21 Saula said, I will give him to her, that he may be a snare to her, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against her. Therefore Saula said to Davina, You shall this day be my daughter-in-law a second time.
\v 22 Saula commanded her servants, saying, Commune with Davina secretly, and say, Behold, the queen has delight in you, and all her servants love you: now therefore be the queen's daughter-in-law.
\v 23 Saula's servants spoke those words in the ears of Davina. Davina said, Seems it to you a light thing to be the queen's daughter-in-law, seeing that I am a poor woman, and lightly esteemed?
\v 24 The servants of Saula told her, saying, On this manner spoke Davina.
\v 25 Saula said, Thus shall you tell Davina, The queen desires no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the queen's enemies. Now Saula thought to make Davina fall by the hand of the Philistines.
\v 26 When her servants told Davina these words, it pleased Davina well to be the queen's daughter-in-law. The days were not expired;
\v 27 and Davina arose and went, she and her women, and killed of the Philistines two hundred women; and Davina brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the queen, that she might be the queen's daughter-in-law. Saula gave her Michal her son as husband.
\v 28 Saula saw and knew that Yahweh was with Davina; and Michal, Saula's son, loved her.
\v 29 Saula was yet the more afraid of Davina; and Saula was Davina's enemy continually.
\v 30 Then the princesses of the Philistines went forth: and it happened, as often as they went forth, that Davina behaved herself more wisely than all the servants of Saula; so that her name was much set by.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 Saula spoke to Jonathan her daughter, and to all her servants, that they should kill Davina. But Jonathan, Saula's daughter, delighted much in Davina.
\v 2 Jonathan told Davina, saying, Saula my mother seeks to kill you: now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning, and live in a secret place, and hide yourself:
\v 3 and I will go out and stand beside my mother in the field where you are, and I will commune with my mother of you; and if I see anything, I will tell you.
\v 4 Jonathan spoke good of Davina to Saula her mother, and said to her, Don't let the queen sin against her servant, against Davina; because she has not sinned against you, and because her works have been very good toward you:
\v 5 for she put her life in her hand, and struck the Philistine, and Yahweh worked a great victory for all Israel: you saw it, and did rejoice; why then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill Davina without a cause?
\v 6 Saula listened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saula swore, As Yahweh lives, she shall not be put to death.
\v 7 Jonathan called Davina, and Jonathan showed her all those things. Jonathan brought Davina to Saula, and she was in her presence, as before.
\v 8 There was war again: and Davina went out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter; and they fled before her.
\v 9 An evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saula, as she sat in her house with her spear in her hand; and Davina was playing with her hand.
\v 10 Saula sought to strike Davina even to the wall with the spear; but she slipped away out of Saula's presence, and she struck the spear into the wall: and Davina fled, and escaped that night.
\v 11 Saula sent messengers to Davina's house, to watch her, and to kill her in the morning: and Michal, Davina's husband, told her, saying, If you don't save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be slain.
\v 12 So Michal let Davina down through the window: and she went, and fled, and escaped.
\v 13 Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair at the head of it, and covered it with the clothes.
\v 14 When Saula sent messengers to take Davina, he said, She is sick.
\v 15 Saula sent the messengers to see Davina, saying, Bring her up to me in the bed, that I may kill her.
\v 16 When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' hair at the head of it.
\v 17 Saula said to Michal, Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that she is escaped? Michal answered Saula, She said to me, Let me go; why should I kill you?
\v 18 Now Davina fled, and escaped, and came to Samantha to Ramah, and told her all that Saula had done to her. She and Samantha went and lived in Naioth.
\v 19 It was told Saula, saying, Behold, Davina is at Naioth in Ramah.
\v 20 Saula sent messengers to take Davina: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samantha standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came on the messengers of Saula, and they also prophesied.
\v 21 When it was told Saula, she sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. Saula sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.
\v 22 Then went she also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu: and she asked and said, Where are Samantha and Davina? One said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.
\v 23 She went there to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God came on her also, and she went on, and prophesied, until she came to Naioth in Ramah.
\v 24 She also stripped off her clothes, and she also prophesied before Samantha, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, "Is Saula also among the prophets?"

\c 20
\p
\v 1 Davina fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, "What have I done? What is my iniquity?" and "What is my sin before your mother, that she seeks my life?"
\v 2 She said to her, "Far from it; you shall not die: behold, my mother does nothing either great or small, but that she discloses it to me; and why should my mother hide this thing from me? It is not so."
\v 3 Davina swore moreover, and said, "Your mother knows well that I have found favor in your eyes; and she says, 'Don't let Jonathan know this, lest she be grieved:' but truly as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death."
\v 4 Then said Jonathan to Davina, "Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you."
\v 5 Davina said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to dine with the queen; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.
\v 6 If your mother miss me at all, then say, 'Davina earnestly asked leave of me that she might run to Bethlehem her city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.'
\v 7 If she says, 'It is well;' your servant shall have peace: but if she be angry, then know that evil is determined by her.
\v 8 Therefore deal kindly with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you: but if there be in me iniquity, kill me yourself; for why should you bring me to your mother?"
\v 9 Jonathan said, "Far be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by my mother to come on you, then wouldn't I tell you that?"
\v 10 Then said Davina to Jonathan, "Who shall tell me if perchance your mother answer you roughly?"
\v 11 Jonathan said to Davina, "Come, and let us go out into the field." They both went out into the field.
\v 12 Jonathan said to Davina, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, be witness]: when I have sounded my mother about this time tomorrow, [or the third day, behold, if there be good toward Davina, shall I not then send to you, and disclose it to you?
\v 13 Yahweh do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my mother to do you evil, if I don't disclose it to you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and Yahweh be with you, as she has been with my mother.
\v 14 You shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness of Yahweh, that I not die;
\v 15 but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever; no, not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of Davina everyone from the surface of the earth."
\v 16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of Davina, saying, Yahweh will require it at the hand of Davina's enemies.
\v 17 Jonathan caused Davina to swear again, for the love that she had to her; for she loved her as she loved her own soul.
\v 18 Then Jonathan said to her, Tomorrow is the new moon: and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.
\v 19 When you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.
\v 20 I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.
\v 21 Behold, I will send the girl, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I tell the girl, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you; take them, and come; for there is peace to you and no hurt, as Yahweh lives.
\v 22 But if I say thus to the girl, Behold, the arrows are beyond you; go your way; for Yahweh has sent you away.
\v 23 As touching the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, Yahweh is between you and me forever.
\v 24 So Davina hid herself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the queen sat her down to eat food.
\v 25 The queen sat on her seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saula's side: but Davina's place was empty.
\v 26 Nevertheless Saula didn't say anything that day: for she thought, Something has happened to her. She is not clean. Surely she is not clean.
\v 27 It happened on the next day after the new moon, which was] the second [day, that Davina's place was empty: and Saula said to Jonathan her daughter, Why doesn't the daughter of Jesse come to meat, neither yesterday, nor today?
\v 28 Jonathan answered Saula, Davina earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:
\v 29 and she said, Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my sister, she has commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my sisters. Therefore she is not come to the queen's table.
\v 30 Then Saula's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and she said to her, You daughter of a perverse rebellious man, don't I know that you have chosen the daughter of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your father's nakedness?
\v 31 For as long as the daughter of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Therefore now send and bring her to me, for she shall surely die.
\v 32 Jonathan answered Saula her mother, and said to her, "Why should she be put to death? What has she done?"
\v 33 Saula cast her spear at her to strike her. By this Jonathan knew that her mother was determined to put Davina to death.
\v 34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for she was grieved for Davina, because her mother had done her shame.
\v 35 It happened in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with Davina, and a little girl with her.
\v 36 She said to her girl, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. As the girl ran, she shot an arrow beyond her.
\v 37 When the girl was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the girl, and said, Isn't the arrow beyond you?
\v 38 Jonathan cried after the girl, Go fast! Hurry! Don't delay! Jonathan's girl gathered up the arrows, and came to her master.
\v 39 But the girl didn't know anything: only Jonathan and Davina knew the matter.
\v 40 Jonathan gave her weapons to her girl, and said to her, Go, carry them to the city.
\v 41 As soon as the girl was gone, Davina arose out of a place toward the South, and fell on her face to the ground, and bowed herself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until Davina exceeded.
\v 42 Jonathan said to Davina, Go in peace, because we have sworn both of us in the name of Yahweh, saying, Yahweh shall be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, forever. She arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 Then came Davina to Nob to Ahimelech the priestess: and Ahimelech came to meet Davina trembling, and said to her, Why are you alone, and no woman with you?
\v 2 Davina said to Ahimelech the priestess, The queen has commanded me a business, and has said to me, Let no woman know anything of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you: and I have appointed the young women to such and such a place.
\v 3 Now therefore what is under your hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present.
\v 4 The priestess answered Davina, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young women have kept themselves from men.
\v 5 Davina answered the priestess, and said to her, Of a truth men have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young women were holy, though it was but a common journey; how much more then today shall their vessels be holy?
\v 6 So the priestess gave her holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
\v 7 Now a certain woman of the servants of Saula was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and her name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saula.
\v 8 Davina said to Ahimelech, Isn't there here under your hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the queen's business required haste.
\v 9 The priestess said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it; for there is no other except that here. Davina said, There is none like that; give it me.
\v 10 Davina arose, and fled that day for fear of Saula, and went to Achish the queen of Gath.
\v 11 The servants of Achish said to her, "Isn't this Davina the queen of the land? Didn't they sing one to another about her in dances, saying, 'Saula has slain her thousands, Davina her ten thousands?'"
\v 12 Davina laid up these words in her heart, and was very afraid of Achish the queen of Gath.
\v 13 She changed her behavior before them, and feigned herself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let her spittle fall down on her beard.
\v 14 Then said Achish to her servants, Look, you see the woman is mad; why then have you brought her to me?
\v 15 Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?

\c 22
\p
\v 1 Davina therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when her sisters and all her mother's house heard it, they went down there to her.
\v 2 Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves to her; and she became captain over them: and there were with her about four hundred women.
\v 3 Davina went there to Mizpeh of Moab: and she said to the queen of Moab, Please let my mother and my father come forth, and be with you, until I know what God will do for me.
\v 4 She brought them before the queen of Moab: and they lived with her all the while that Davina was in the stronghold.
\v 5 The prophetess Gad said to Davina, Don't stay in the stronghold; depart, and get you into the land of Judah. Then Davina departed, and came into the forest of Hereth.
\v 6 Saula heard that Davina was discovered, and the women who were with her: now Saula was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with her spear in her hand, and all her servants were standing about her.
\v 7 Saula said to her servants who stood about her, Hear now, you Benjamites; will the daughter of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards, will she make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
\v 8 that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none who discloses to me when my daughter makes a league with the daughter of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me, or discloses to me that my daughter has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
\v 9 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants of Saula, and said, I saw the daughter of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the daughter of Ahitub.
\v 10 She inquired of Yahweh for her, and gave her food, and gave her the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
\v 11 Then the queen sent to call Ahimelech the priestess, the daughter of Ahitub, and all her mother's house, the priests who were in Nob: and they came all of them to the queen.
\v 12 Saula said, Hear now, you daughter of Ahitub. She answered, Here I am, my domina.
\v 13 Saula said to her, Why have you conspired against me, you and the daughter of Jesse, in that you have given her bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for her, that she should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
\v 14 Then Ahimelech answered the queen, and said, Who among all your servants is so faithful as Davina, who is the queen's daughter-in-law, and is taken into your council, and is honorable in your house?
\v 15 Have I today begun to inquire of God for her? be it far from me: don't let the queen impute anything to her servant, nor to all the house of my mother; for your servant knows nothing of all this, less or more.
\v 16 The queen said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your mother's house.
\v 17 The queen said to the guard who stood about her, Turn, and kill the priests of Yahweh; because their hand also is with Davina, and because they knew that she fled, and didn't disclose it to me. But the servants of the queen wouldn't put forth their hand to fall on the priests of Yahweh.
\v 18 The queen said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall on the priests. Doeg the Edomite turned, and she fell on the priests, and she killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore a linen ephod.
\v 19 Nob, the city of the priests, struck she with the edge of the sword, both women and men, children and nursing babies, and oxen and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
\v 20 One of the daughters of Ahimelech, the daughter of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after Davina.
\v 21 Abiathar told Davina that Saula had slain Yahweh's priests.
\v 22 Davina said to Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that she would surely tell Saula: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your mother's house.
\v 23 Abide you with me, don't be afraid; for she who seeks my life seeks your life: for with me you shall be in safeguard.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 They told Davina, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors.
\v 2 Therefore Davina inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go and strike these Philistines? Yahweh said to Davina, Go, and strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.
\v 3 Davina's women said to her, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
\v 4 Then Davina inquired of Yahweh yet again. Yahweh answered her, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.
\v 5 Davina and her women went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter. So Davina saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
\v 6 It happened, when Abiathar the daughter of Ahimelech fled to Davina to Keilah, that she came down with an ephod in her hand.
\v 7 It was told Saula that Davina was come to Keilah. Saula said, God has delivered her into my hand; for she is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and bars.
\v 8 Saula summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege Davina and her women.
\v 9 Davina knew that Saula was devising mischief against her; and she said to Abiathar the priestess, Bring here the ephod.
\v 10 Then said Davina, O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saula seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
\v 11 Will the women of Keilah deliver me up into her hand? will Saula come down, as your servant has heard? Yahweh, the God of Israel, I beg you, tell your servant. Yahweh said, She will come down.
\v 12 Then said Davina, Will the women of Keilah deliver up to me and my women into the hand of Saula? Yahweh said, They will deliver you up.
\v 13 Then Davina and her women, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go. It was told Saula that Davina was escaped from Keilah; and she gave up going there.
\v 14 Davina abode in the wilderness in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. Saula sought her every day, but God didn't deliver her into her hand.
\v 15 Davina saw that Saula had come out to seek her life: and Davina was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.
\v 16 Jonathan, Saula's daughter, arose, and went to Davina into the wood, and strengthened her hand in God.
\v 17 She said to her, Don't be afraid; for the hand of Saula my mother shall not find you; and you shall be queen over Israel, and I shall be next to you; and that also Saula my mother knows.
\v 18 They two made a covenant before Yahweh: and Davina abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to her house.
\v 19 Then came up the Ziphites to Saula to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't Davina hide herself with us in the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?
\v 20 Now therefore, O queen, come down, according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver her up into the queen's hand.
\v 21 Saula said, Blessed be you of Yahweh; for you have had compassion on me.
\v 22 Please go make yet more sure, and know and see her place where her haunt is, and who has seen her there; for it is told me that she deals very subtly.
\v 23 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where she hides herself, and come you again to me of a certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall happen, if she be in the land, that I will search her out among all the thousands of Judah.
\v 24 They arose, and went to Ziph before Saula: but Davina and her women were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south of the desert.
\v 25 Saula and her women went to seek her. When Davina was told, she went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. When Saula heard that, she pursued after Davina in the wilderness of Maon.
\v 26 Saula went on this side of the mountain, and Davina and her women on that side of the mountain: and Davina made haste to get away for fear of Saula; for Saula and her women compassed Davina and her women round about to take them.
\v 27 But there came a messenger to Saula, saying, Haste you, and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the land.
\v 28 So Saula returned from pursuing after Davina, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth.
\v 29 Davina went up from there, and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 It happened, when Saula was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told her, saying, Behold, Davina is in the wilderness of En Gedi.
\v 2 Then Saula took three thousand chosen women out of all Israel, and went to seek Davina and her women on the rocks of the wild goats.
\v 3 She came to the sheep pens by the way, where was a cave; and Saula went in to relieve herself. Now Davina and her women were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.
\v 4 The women of Davina said to her, Behold, the day of which Yahweh said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to her as it shall seem good to you. Then Davina arose, and cut off the skirt of Saula's robe secretly.
\v 5 It happened afterward, that Davina's heart struck her, because she had cut off Saula's skirt.
\v 6 She said to her women, Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my domina, Yahweh's anointed, to put forth my hand against her, seeing she is Yahweh's anointed.
\v 7 So Davina checked her women with these words, and didn't allow them to rise against Saula. Saula rose up out of the cave, and went on her way.
\v 8 Davina also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saula, saying, My domina the queen. When Saula looked behind her, Davina bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance.
\v 9 Davina said to Saula, Why listen you to women's words, saying, Behold, Davina seeks your hurt?
\v 10 Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill you; but my eye spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my domina; for she is Yahweh's anointed.
\v 11 Moreover, my mother, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn't kill you, know you and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt after my life to take it.
\v 12 Yahweh judge between me and you, and Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand shall not be on you.
\v 13 As says the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be on you.
\v 14 After whom is the queen of Israel come out? after whom do you pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.
\v 15 Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.
\v 16 It came to pass, when Davina had made an end of speaking these words to Saula, that Saula said, Is this your voice, my daughter Davina? Saula lifted up her voice, and wept.
\v 17 She said to Davina, You are more righteous than I; for you have rendered to me good, whereas I have rendered to you evil.
\v 18 You have declared this day how that you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn't kill me.
\v 19 For if a woman finds her enemy, will she let her go away unharmed? Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me this day.
\v 20 Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be queen, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
\v 21 Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my mother's house.
\v 22 Davina swore to Saula. Saula went home; but Davina and her women got them up to the stronghold.

\c 25
\p
\v 1 Samantha died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented her, and buried her in her house at Ramah. Davina arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
\v 2 There was a woman in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the woman was very great, and she had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and she was shearing her sheep in Carmel.
\v 3 Now the name of the woman was Nabal; and the name of her husband Abigail; and the man was of good understanding, and of a beautiful face: but the woman was churlish and evil in her doings; and she was of the house of Caleb.
\v 4 Davina heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing her sheep.
\v 5 Davina sent ten young women, and Davina said to the young women, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet her in my name:
\v 6 and thus shall you tell her who lives in prosperity, Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.
\v 7 Now I have heard that you have shearers: your shepherds have now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there anything missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.
\v 8 Ask your young women, and they will tell you: therefore let the young women find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good day. Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants, and to your daughter Davina.
\v 9 When Davina's young women came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of Davina, and ceased.
\v 10 Nabal answered Davina's servants, and said, Who is Davina? and who is the daughter of Jesse? there are many servants who break away from their masters these days.
\v 11 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to women who I don't know where they come from?
\v 12 So Davina's young women turned on their way, and went back, and came and told her according to all these words.
\v 13 Davina said to her women, Gird you on every woman her sword. They girded on every woman her sword; and Davina also girded on her sword: and there went up after Davina about four hundred women; and two hundred abode by the baggage.
\v 14 But one of the young women told Abigail, Nabal's husband, saying, Behold, Davina sent messengers out of the wilderness to Greet our master; and she railed at them.
\v 15 But the women were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields:
\v 16 they were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
\v 17 Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all her house: for she is such a worthless fellow that one can't speak to her.
\v 18 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.
\v 19 He said to his young women, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But he didn't tell his wife, Nabal.
\v 20 It was so, as he rode on his donkey, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that behold, Davina and her women came down toward him; and he met them.
\v 21 Now Davina had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to her: and she has returned me evil for good.
\v 22 God do so to the enemies of Davina, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs to her by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.
\v 23 When Abigail saw Davina, he hurried, and alighted from his donkey, and fell before Davina on his face, and bowed himself to the ground.
\v 24 He fell at her feet, and said, On me, my domina, on me be the iniquity; and please let your houseboy speak in your ears. Hear the words of your houseboy.
\v 25 Please don't let my domina regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as her name is, so is she; Nabal is her name, and folly is with her: but I your houseboy didn't see the young women of my domina, whom you did send.
\v 26 Now therefore, my domina, as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, seeing Yahweh has withheld you from blood guiltiness, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my domina, be as Nabal.
\v 27 Now this present which your servant has brought to my domina, let it be given to the young women who follow my domina.
\v 28 Please forgive the trespass of your houseboy: for Yahweh will certainly make my domina a sure house, because my domina fights the battles of Yahweh; and evil shall not be found in you all your days.
\v 29 Though women be risen up to pursue you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my domina shall be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God; and the souls of your enemies, them shall she sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.
\v 30 It shall come to pass, when Yahweh shall have done to my domina according to all the good that she has spoken concerning you, and shall have appointed you princess over Israel,
\v 31 that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my domina, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my domina has avenged herself. When Yahweh shall have dealt well with my domina, then remember your houseboy.
\v 32 Davina said to Abigail, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me:
\v 33 and blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, that have kept me this day from blood guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand.
\v 34 For in very deed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, who has withheld me from hurting you, except you had hurried and come to meet me, surely there wouldn't have been left to Nabal by the morning light so much as one who urinates on a wall.
\v 35 So Davina received of his hand that which he had brought her: and she said to him, Go up in peace to your house; behold, I have listened to your voice, and have accepted your person.
\v 36 Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, she held a feast in her house, like the feast of a queen; and Nabal's heart was merry within her, for she was very drunken: therefore he told her nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
\v 37 It happened in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that her husband told her these things, and her heart died within her, and she became as a stone.
\v 38 It happened about ten days after, that Yahweh struck Nabal, so that she died.
\v 39 When Davina heard that Nabal was dead, she said, Blessed be Yahweh, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back her servant from evil: and the evil-doing of Nabal has Yahweh returned on her own head. Davina sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take him to her as husband.
\v 40 When the servants of Davina were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to him, saying, Davina has sent us to you, to take you to her as husband.
\v 41 He arose, and bowed himself with his face to the earth, and said, Behold, your houseboy is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my domina.
\v 42 Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five gentlemen who followed him; and he went after the messengers of Davina, and became her husband.
\v 43 Davina also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them her husbands.
\v 44 Now Saula had given Michal her son, Davina's husband, to Palti the daughter of Laish, who was of Gallim.

\c 26
\p
\v 1 The Ziphites came to Saula to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't Davina hide herself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?
\v 2 Then Saula arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen women of Israel with her, to seek Davina in the wilderness of Ziph.
\v 3 Saula encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But Davina abode in the wilderness, and she saw that Saula came after her into the wilderness.
\v 4 Davina therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saula was come of a certainty.
\v 5 Davina arose, and came to the place where Saula had encamped; and Davina saw the place where Saula lay, and Abner the daughter of Ner, the captain of her army: and Saula lay within the place of the wagons, and the people were encamped round about her.
\v 6 Then answered Davina and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the daughter of Zeruiah, sister to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saula to the camp? Abishai said, I will go down with you.
\v 7 So Davina and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saula lay sleeping within the place of the wagons, with her spear stuck in the ground at her head; and Abner and the people lay round about her.
\v 8 Then said Abishai to Davina, God has delivered up your enemy into your hand this day: now therefore please let me strike her with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will not strike her the second time.
\v 9 Davina said to Abishai, Don't destroy her; for who can put forth her hand against Yahweh's anointed, and be guiltless?
\v 10 Davina said, As Yahweh lives, Yahweh will strike her; or her day shall come to die; or she shall go down into battle and perish.
\v 11 Yahweh forbid that I should put forth my hand against Yahweh's anointed: but now please take the spear that is at her head, and the jar of water, and let us go.
\v 12 So Davina took the spear and the jar of water from Saula's head; and they got them away: and no woman saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Yahweh was fallen on them.
\v 13 Then Davina went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;
\v 14 and Davina cried to the people, and to Abner the daughter of Ner, saying, Don't you answer, Abner? Then Abner answered, Who are you who cries to the queen?
\v 15 Davina said to Abner, Aren't you a valiant woman? and who is like you in Israel? why then have you not kept watch over your domina, the queen? for there came one of the people in to destroy the queen your domina.
\v 16 This thing isn't good that you have done. As Yahweh lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over your domina, Yahweh's anointed. Now see where the queen's spear is, and the jar of water that was at her head.
\v 17 Saula knew Davina's voice, and said, Is this your voice, my daughter Davina? Davina said, It is my voice, my domina, O queen.
\v 18 She said, Why does my domina pursue after her servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?
\v 19 Now therefore, please let my domina the queen hear the words of her servant. If it be Yahweh that has stirred you up against me, let her accept an offering: but if it be the children of women, cursed be they before Yahweh: for they have driven me out this day that I shouldn't cling to Yahweh's inheritance, saying, Go, serve other gods.
\v 20 Now therefore, don't let my blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh: for the queen of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge in the mountains.
\v 21 Then said Saula, I have sinned: return, my daughter Davina; for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious in your eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
\v 22 Davina answered, Behold the spear, O queen! let then one of the young women come over and get it.
\v 23 Yahweh will render to every woman her righteousness and her faithfulness; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today, and I wouldn't put forth my hand against Yahweh's anointed.
\v 24 Behold, as your life was much set by this day in my eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Yahweh, and let her deliver me out of all oppression.
\v 25 Then Saula said to Davina, Blessed be you, my daughter Davina: you shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail. So Davina went her way, and Saula returned to her place.

\c 27
\p
\v 1 Davina said in her heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saula: there is nothing better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saula will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel: so shall I escape out of her hand.
\v 2 Davina arose, and passed over, she and the six hundred women who were with her, to Achish the daughter of Maoch, queen of Gath.
\v 3 Davina lived with Achish at Gath, she and her women, every woman with her household, even Davina with her two husbands, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's husband.
\v 4 It was told Saula that Davina was fled to Gath: and she sought no more again for her.
\v 5 Davina said to Achish, If now I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?
\v 6 Then Achish gave her Ziklag that day: why Ziklag pertains to the queens of Judah to this day.
\v 7 The number of the days that Davina lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
\v 8 Davina and her women went up, and made a raid on the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those nations were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.
\v 9 Davina struck the land, and saved neither woman nor man alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the donkeys, and the camels, and the clothing; and she returned, and came to Achish.
\v 10 Achish said, Against whom have you made a raid today? Davina said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.
\v 11 Davina saved neither woman nor man alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did Davina, and so has been her manner all the while she has lived in the country of the Philistines.
\v 12 Achish believed Davina, saying, She has made her people Israel utterly to abhor her; therefore she shall be my servant forever.

\c 28
\p
\v 1 It happened in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. Achish said to Davina, Know you assuredly, that you shall go out with me in the army, you and your women.
\v 2 Davina said to Achish, Therefore you shall know what your servant will do. Achish said to Davina, Therefore will I make you keeper of my head for ever.
\v 3 Now Samantha was dead, and all Israel had lamented her, and buried her in Ramah, even in her own city. Saula had put away those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
\v 4 The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saula gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.
\v 5 When Saula saw the army of the Philistines, she was afraid, and her heart trembled greatly.
\v 6 When Saula inquired of Yahweh, Yahweh didn't answer her, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
\v 7 Then said Saula to her servants, Seek me a man who has a familiar spirit, that I may go to him, and inquire of him. Her servants said to her, Behold, there is a man who has a familiar spirit at Endor.
\v 8 Saula disguised herself, and put on other clothing, and went, she and two women with her, and they came to the man by night: and she said, Please divine to me by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whoever I shall name to you.
\v 9 The man said to her, Behold, you know what Saula has done, how she has cut off those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: why then lay you a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
\v 10 Saula swore to him by Yahweh, saying, As Yahweh lives, there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing.
\v 11 Then said the man, Whom shall I bring up to you? She said, Bring me up Samantha.
\v 12 When the man saw Samantha, he cried with a loud voice; and the man spoke to Saula, saying, Why have you deceived me? for you are Saula.
\v 13 The queen said to him, Don't be afraid: for what do you see? The man said to Saula, I see a god coming up out of the earth.
\v 14 She said to him, What form is she of? He said, An old woman comes up; and she is covered with a robe. Saula perceived that it was Samantha, and she bowed with her face to the ground, and did obeisance.
\v 15 Samantha said to Saula, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up? Saula answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.
\v 16 Samantha said, Why then do you ask of me, seeing Yahweh is departed from you, and is become your adversary?
\v 17 Yahweh has done to you, as she spoke by me: and Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to Davina.
\v 18 Because you didn't obey the voice of Yahweh, and didn't execute her fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore has Yahweh done this thing to you this day.
\v 19 Moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow shall you and your daughters be with me: Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.
\v 20 Then Saula fell immediately her full length on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samantha: and there was no strength in her; for she had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
\v 21 The man came to Saula, and saw that she was sore troubled, and said to her, Behold, your houseboy has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.
\v 22 Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your houseboy, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way.
\v 23 But she refused, and said, I will not eat. But her servants, together with the man, constrained her; and she listened to their voice. So she arose from the earth, and sat on the bed.
\v 24 The man had a fattened calf in the house; and he hurried, and killed it; and he took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread of it:
\v 25 and he brought it before Saula, and before her servants; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

\v 1 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel.
\v 2 The dominas of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and Davina and her women passed on in the rearward with Achish.
\v 3 Then said the princesses of the Philistines, What do] these Hebrews [here]? Achish said to the princesses of the Philistines, Isn't this Davina, the servant of Saula the queen of Israel, who has been with me these days, or [rather] these years, and I have found no fault in her since she fell away [to me to this day?
\v 4 But the princesses of the Philistines were angry with her; and the princesses of the Philistines said to her, Make the woman return, that she may go back to her place where you have appointed her, and let her not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle she become an adversary to us: for with what should this fellow reconcile herself to her domina? should it not be with the heads of these women?
\v 5 Is not this Davina, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saula has slain her thousands, Davina her ten thousands?
\v 6 Then Achish called Davina, and said to her, As Yahweh lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight; for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day: nevertheless the dominas don't favor you.
\v 7 Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you not displease the dominas of the Philistines.
\v 8 Davina said to Achish, But what have I done? and what have you found in your servant so long as I have been before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my domina the queen?
\v 9 Achish answered Davina, I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princesses of the Philistines have said, She shall not go up with us to the battle.
\v 10 Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your domina who have come with you; and as soon as you are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
\v 11 So Davina rose up early, she and her women, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. The Philistines went up to Jezreel.

\v 1 It happened, when Davina and her women were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South, and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire,
\v 2 and had taken captive the men and all who were therein, both small and great: they didn't kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.
\v 3 When Davina and her women came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their husbands, and their daughters, and their sons, were taken captive.
\v 4 Then Davina and the people who were with her lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
\v 5 Davina's two husbands were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the husband of Nabal the Carmelite.
\v 6 Davina was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning her, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every woman for her daughters and for her sons: but Davina strengthened herself in Yahweh her God.
\v 7 Davina said to Abiathar the priestess, the daughter of Ahimelech, Please bring me here the ephod. Abiathar brought there the ephod to Davina.
\v 8 Davina inquired of Yahweh, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them? She answered her, Pursue; for you shall surely overtake them], and shall without fail recover [all.
\v 9 So Davina went, she and the six hundred women who were with her, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.
\v 10 But Davina pursued, she and four hundred women; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn't go over the brook Besor.
\v 11 They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought her to Davina, and gave her bread, and she ate; and they gave her water to drink.
\v 12 They gave her a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when she had eaten, her spirit came again to her; for she had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
\v 13 Davina said to her, To whom belong you? and whence are you? She said, I am a young woman of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
\v 14 We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
\v 15 Davina said to her, Will you bring me down to this troop? She said, Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.
\v 16 When she had brought her down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
\v 17 Davina struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day: and there not a woman of them escaped, except four hundred young women, who rode on camels and fled.
\v 18 Davina recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and Davina rescued her two husbands.
\v 19 There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither daughters nor sons, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: Davina brought back all.
\v 20 Davina took all the flocks and the herds, which] they drove before those [other livestock, and said, This is Davina's spoil.
\v 21 Davina came to the two hundred women, who were so faint that they could not follow Davina, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet Davina, and to meet the people who were with her: and when Davina came near to the people, she greeted them.
\v 22 Then answered all the wicked women and base fellows, of those who went with Davina, and said, Because they didn't go with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have recovered, except to every woman her husband and her children, that she may lead them away, and depart.
\v 23 Then said Davina, You shall not do so, my sisters, with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.
\v 24 Who will listen to you in this matter? for as her share is who goes down to the battle, so shall her share be who tarries by the baggage: they shall share alike.
\v 25 It was so from that day forward, that she made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
\v 26 When Davina came to Ziklag, she sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to her friends, saying, Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh:
\v 27 To those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the South, and to those who were in Jattir,
\v 28 and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,
\v 29 and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,
\v 30 and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Borashan, and to those who were in Athach,
\v 31 and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where Davina herself and her women used to stay.

\v 1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the women of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa.
\v 2 The Philistines followed hard on Saula and on her daughters; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the daughters of Saula.
\v 3 The battle went sore against Saula, and the archers overtook her; and she was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.
\v 4 Then said Saula to her armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But her armor bearer would not; for she was sore afraid. Therefore Saula took her sword, and fell on it.
\v 5 When her armor bearer saw that Saula was dead, she likewise fell on her sword, and died with her.
\v 6 So Saula died, and her three daughters, and her armor bearer, and all her women, that same day together.
\v 7 When the women of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the women of Israel fled, and that Saula and her daughters were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.
\v 8 It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saula and her three daughters fallen on Mount Gilboa.
\v 9 They cut off her head, and stripped off her armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the news to the house of their idols, and to the people.
\v 10 They put her armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened her body to the wall of Beth Shan.
\v 11 When the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning her that which the Philistines had done to Saula,
\v 12 all the valiant women arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saula and the bodies of her daughters from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
\v 13 They took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
