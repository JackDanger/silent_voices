\v 1 Now these are the names of the daughters of Israel, who came into Egypt (every woman and her household came with Jacoba):
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levia, and Judah,
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
\v 4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
\v 5 All the souls who came out of Jacoba's body were seventy souls, and Josephine was in Egypt already.
\v 6 Josephine died, as did all her sisters, and all that generation.
\v 7 The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.
\v 8 Now there arose a new queen over Egypt, who didn't know Josephine.
\v 9 She said to her people, "Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.
\v 10 Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and escape out of the land."
\v 11 Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.
\v 12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They were grieved because of the children of Israel.
\v 13 The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve,
\v 14 and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.
\v 15 The queen of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah,
\v 16 and she said, "When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew men, and see them on the birth stool; if it is a daughter, then you shall kill her; but if it is a son, then he shall live."
\v 17 But the midwives feared God, and didn't do what the queen of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby girls alive.
\v 18 The queen of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, and have saved the girls alive?"
\v 19 The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew men aren't like the Egyptian men; for they are vigorous, and give birth before the midwife comes to them."
\v 20 God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.
\v 21 It happened, because the midwives feared God, that she gave them families.
\v 22 Pharaoh charged all her people, saying, "You shall cast every daughter who is born into the river, and every son you shall save alive."

\p
\v 1 A woman of the house of Levia went and took a son of Levia as her husband.
\v 2 The man conceived, and bore a daughter. When he saw that she was a fine child, he hid her three months.
\v 3 When he could no longer hide her, he took a papyrus basket for her, and coated it with tar and with pitch. He put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river's bank.
\v 4 Her brother stood far off, to see what would be done to her.
\v 5 Pharaoh's son came down to bathe at the river. His manservants walked along by the riverside. He saw the basket among the reeds, and sent his houseboy to get it.
\v 6 He opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. He had compassion on her, and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."
\v 7 Then her brother said to Pharaoh's son, "Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew men, that he may nurse the child for you?"
\v 8 Pharaoh's son said to him, "Go." The manservant went and called the child's father.
\v 9 Pharaoh's son said to him, "Take this child away, and nurse her for me, and I will give you your wages." The man took the child, and nursed it.
\v 10 The child grew, and he brought her to Pharaoh's son, and she became his daughter. He named her Moses, and said, "Because I drew her out of the water."
\v 11 It happened in those days, when Moses had grown up, that she went out to her sisters, and looked at their burdens. She saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of her sisters.
\v 12 She looked this way and that way, and when she saw that there was no one, she killed the Egyptian, and hid her in the sand.
\v 13 She went out the second day, and behold, two women of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. She said to her who did the wrong, "Why do you strike your fellow?"
\v 14 She said, "Who made you a princess and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?" Moses was afraid, and said, "Surely this thing is known."
\v 15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, she sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and she sat down by a well.
\v 16 Now the priestess of Midian had seven sons. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their mother's flock.
\v 17 The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
\v 18 When they came to Reuel, their mother, she said, "How is it that you have returned so early today?"
\v 19 They said, "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover she drew water for us, and watered the flock."
\v 20 She said to her sons, "Where is she? Why is it that you have left the woman? Call her, that she may eat bread."
\v 21 Moses was content to dwell with the woman. She gave Moses Zipporah, her son.
\v 22 He bore a daughter, and she named her Gershom, for she said, "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land."
\v 23 It happened in the course of those many days, that the queen of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.
\v 24 God heard their groaning, and God remembered her covenant with Abrahai, with Isaaca, and with Jacoba.
\v 25 God saw the children of Israel, and God was concerned about them.

\p
\v 1 Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, her mother-in-law, the priestess of Midian, and she led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to God's mountain, to Horeb.
\v 2 The angel of Yahweh appeared to her in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. She looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
\v 3 Moses said, "I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt."
\v 4 When Yahweh saw that she turned aside to see, God called to her out of the midst of the bush, and said, "Moses! Moses!" She said, "Here I am."
\v 5 She said, "Don't come close. Take your sandals off of your feet, for the place you are standing on is holy ground."
\v 6 Moreover she said, "I am the God of your mother, the God of Abrahai, the God of Isaaca, and the God of Jacoba." Moses hid her face; for she was afraid to look at God.
\v 7 Yahweh said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.
\v 8 I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
\v 9 Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
\v 10 Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt."
\v 11 Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?"
\v 12 She said, "Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I have sent you: when you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."
\v 13 Moses said to God, "Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'The God of your mothers has sent me to you;' and they ask me, 'What is her name?' What should I tell them?"
\v 14 God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM," and she said, "You shall tell the children of Israel this: 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
\v 15 God said moreover to Moses, "You shall tell the children of Israel this, 'Yahweh, the God of your mothers, the God of Abrahai, the God of Isaaca, and the God of Jacoba, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations.
\v 16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them, 'Yahweh, the God of your mothers, the God of Abrahai, of Isaaca, and of Jacoba, has appeared to me, saying, "I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt;
\v 17 and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey."'
\v 18 They will listen to your voice, and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the queen of Egypt, and you shall tell her, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh, our God.'
\v 19 I know that the queen of Egypt won't give you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand.
\v 20 I will put forth my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of it, and after that she will let you go.
\v 21 I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed.
\v 22 But every man shall ask of his neighbor, and of him who visits his house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your daughters, and on your sons. You shall despoil the Egyptians.

\v 1 Moses answered, "But, behold, they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say, 'Yahweh has not appeared to you.'"
\v 2 Yahweh said to her, "What is that in your hand?" She said, "A rod."
\v 3 She said, "Throw it on the ground." She threw it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it.
\v 4 Yahweh said to Moses, "Put forth your hand, and take it by the tail." She put forth her hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in her hand.
\v 5 "That they may believe that Yahweh, the God of their mothers, the God of Abrahai, the God of Isaaca, and the God of Jacoba, has appeared to you."
\v 6 Yahweh said furthermore to her, "Now put your hand inside your cloak." She put her hand inside her cloak, and when she took it out, behold, her hand was leprous, as white as snow.
\v 7 She said, "Put your hand inside your cloak again." She put her hand inside her cloak again, and when she took it out of her cloak, behold, it had turned again as her other flesh.
\v 8 "It will happen, if they will neither believe you nor listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
\v 9 It will happen, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither listen to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land. The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land."
\v 10 Moses said to Yahweh, "Oh, Domina, I am not eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue."
\v 11 Yahweh said to her, "Who made woman's mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Isn't it I, Yahweh?
\v 12 Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak."
\v 13 She said, "Oh, Domina, please send someone else."
\v 14 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Moses, and she said, "What about Aaron, your sister, the Levite? I know that she can speak well. Also, behold, she comes forth to meet you. When she sees you, she will be glad in her heart.
\v 15 You shall speak to her, and put the words in her mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with her mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.
\v 16 She will be your spokesman to the people; and it will happen, that she will be to you a mouth, and you will be to her as God.
\v 17 You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs."
\v 18 Moses went and returned to Jethro her mother-in-law, and said to her, "Please let me go and return to my sisters who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive." Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."
\v 19 Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, "Go, return into Egypt; for all the women who sought your life are dead."
\v 20 Moses took her husband and her daughters, and set them on a donkey, and she returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took God's rod in her hand.
\v 21 Yahweh said to Moses, "When you go back into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand, but I will harden her heart and she will not let the people go.
\v 22 You shall tell Pharaoh, 'Thus says Yahweh, Israel is my daughter, my firstborn,
\v 23 and I have said to you, "Let my daughter go, that she may serve me;" and you have refused to let her go. Behold, I will kill your daughter, your firstborn.'"
\v 24 It happened on the way at a lodging place, that Yahweh met her and wanted to kill her.
\v 25 Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the vulva of his daughter, and cast it at her feet; and he said, "Surely you are a bride of blood to me."
\v 26 So she let her alone. Then he said, "You are a bride of blood," because of the circumcision.
\v 27 Yahweh said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." She went, and met her on God's mountain, and kissed her.
\v 28 Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh with which she had sent her, and all the signs with which she had charged her.
\v 29 Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.
\v 30 Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.
\v 31 The people believed, and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of Israel, and that she had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshiped.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, "This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, 'Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.'"
\v 2 Pharaoh said, "Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to her voice to let Israel go? I don't know Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go."
\v 3 They said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh, our God, lest she fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword."
\v 4 The queen of Egypt said to them, "Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!"
\v 5 Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens."
\v 6 The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
\v 7 "You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
\v 8 The number of the bricks, which they made before, you require from them. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'
\v 9 Let heavier work be laid on the women, that they may labor therein; and don't let them pay any attention to lying words."
\v 10 The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, This is what Pharaoh says: "I will not give you straw.
\v 11 Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished."
\v 12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
\v 13 The taskmasters were urgent saying, "Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!"
\v 14 The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, "Why haven't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?"
\v 15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants?
\v 16 No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, 'Make brick!' and behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people."
\v 17 But she said, "You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh.'
\v 18 Go therefore now, and work, for no straw shall be given to you, yet shall you deliver the same number of bricks!"
\v 19 The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble, when it was said, "You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!"
\v 20 They met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:
\v 21 and they said to them, "May Yahweh look at you, and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of her servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us."
\v 22 Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, "Domina, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me?
\v 23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, she has brought trouble on this people; neither have you delivered your people at all."

\c 6
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand she shall let them go, and by a strong hand she shall drive them out of her land."
\v 2 God spoke to Moses, and said to her, "I am Yahweh;
\v 3 and I appeared to Abrahai, to Isaaca, and to Jacoba, as God Almighty; but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them.
\v 4 I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens.
\v 5 Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant.
\v 6 Therefore tell the children of Israel, 'I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:
\v 7 and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
\v 8 I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abrahai, to Isaaca, and to Jacoba; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am Yahweh.'"
\v 9 Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn't listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
\v 10 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 11 "Go in, speak to Pharaoh queen of Egypt, that she let the children of Israel go out of her land."
\v 12 Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, "Behold, the children of Israel haven't listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, who am of uncircumcised lips?"
\v 13 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh queen of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
\v 14 These are the heads of their mothers' houses. The daughters of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.
\v 15 The daughters of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the daughter of a Canaanite man; these are the families of Simeon.
\v 16 These are the names of the daughters of Levia according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levia were one hundred thirty-seven years.
\v 17 The daughters of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families.
\v 18 The daughters of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty-three years.
\v 19 The daughters of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.
\v 20 Amram took Jochebed her mother's brother to herself as husband; and he bore her Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty-seven years.
\v 21 The daughters of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
\v 22 The daughters of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri.
\v 23 Aaron took Elisheba, the son of Amminadab, the brother of Nahshon, as her husband; and he bore her Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
\v 24 The daughters of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.
\v 25 Eleazar Aaron's daughter took one of the sons of Putiel as her husband; and he bore her Phinehas. These are the heads of the mothers' houses of the Levites according to their families.
\v 26 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom Yahweh said, "Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies."
\v 27 These are those who spoke to Pharaoh queen of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These are that Moses and Aaron.
\v 28 It happened on the day when Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
\v 29 that Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "I am Yahweh. Speak to Pharaoh queen of Egypt all that I speak to you."
\v 30 Moses said before Yahweh, "Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh listen to me?"

\c 7
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses, "Behold, I have made you as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your sister shall be your prophetess.
\v 2 You shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your sister shall speak to Pharaoh, that she let the children of Israel go out of her land.
\v 3 I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
\v 4 But Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will lay my hand on Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
\v 5 The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh, when I stretch forth my hand on Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them."
\v 6 Moses and Aaron did so. As Yahweh commanded them, so they did.
\v 7 Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
\v 8 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\v 9 "When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Perform a miracle!' then you shall tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.'"
\v 10 Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Yahweh had commanded: and Aaron cast down her rod before Pharaoh and before her servants, and it became a serpent.
\v 11 Then Pharaoh also called for the wise women and the sorcerers. They also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments.
\v 12 For they cast down every woman her rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
\v 13 Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and she didn't listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken.
\v 14 Yahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is stubborn. She refuses to let the people go.
\v 15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning. Behold, she goes out to the water; and you shall stand by the river's bank to meet her; and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand.
\v 16 You shall tell her, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, "Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness:" and behold, until now you haven't listened.
\v 17 Thus says Yahweh, "In this you shall know that I am Yahweh. Behold, I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
\v 18 The fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river."'"
\v 19 Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"
\v 20 Moses and Aaron did so, as Yahweh commanded; and she lifted up the rod, and struck the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of her servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
\v 21 The fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians couldn't drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.
\v 22 The magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and she didn't listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken.
\v 23 Pharaoh turned and went into her house, neither did she lay even this to heart.
\v 24 All the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink; for they couldn't drink of the water of the river.
\v 25 Seven days were fulfilled, after Yahweh had struck the river.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell her, "This is what Yahweh says, 'Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\v 2 If you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your borders with frogs:
\v 3 and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedchamber, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:
\v 4 and the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.'"
\v 5 Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch forth your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.'"
\v 6 Aaron stretched out her hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
\v 7 The magicians did in like manner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.
\v 8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, "Entreat Yahweh, that she take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Yahweh."
\v 9 Moses said to Pharaoh, "I give you the honor of setting the time that I should pray for you, and for your servants, and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses, and remain in the river only."
\v 10 She said, "Tomorrow." She said, "Be it according to your word, that you may know that there is none like Yahweh our God.
\v 11 The frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only."
\v 12 Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to Yahweh concerning the frogs which she had brought on Pharaoh.
\v 13 Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.
\v 14 They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.
\v 15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, she hardened her heart, and didn't listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken.
\v 16 Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.'"
\v 17 They did so; and Aaron stretched out her hand with her rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on woman, and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
\v 18 The magicians tried with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they couldn't. There were lice on woman, and on animal.
\v 19 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God:" and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and she didn't listen to them; as Yahweh had spoken.
\v 20 Yahweh said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; behold, she comes forth to the water; and tell her, 'This is what Yahweh says, "Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\v 21 Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.
\v 22 I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst of the earth.
\v 23 I will put a division between my people and your people: by tomorrow shall this sign be."'"
\v 24 Yahweh did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into her servants' houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.
\v 25 Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God in the land!"
\v 26 Moses said, "It isn't appropriate to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Yahweh our God. Behold, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and won't they stone us?
\v 27 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, as she shall command us."
\v 28 Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the wilderness, only you shall not go very far away. Pray for me."
\v 29 Moses said, "Behold, I go out from you, and I will pray to Yahweh that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from her servants, and from her people, tomorrow; only don't let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Yahweh."
\v 30 Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.
\v 31 Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and she removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from her servants, and from her people. There remained not one.
\v 32 Pharaoh hardened her heart this time also, and she didn't let the people go.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, and tell her, 'This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\v 2 For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still,
\v 3 behold, the hand of Yahweh is on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence.
\v 4 Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongs to the children of Israel."'"
\v 5 Yahweh appointed a set time, saying, "Tomorrow Yahweh shall do this thing in the land."
\v 6 Yahweh did that thing on the next day; and all the livestock of Egypt died, but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not one died.
\v 7 Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and she didn't let the people go.
\v 8 Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, "Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.
\v 9 It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with boils on woman and on animal, throughout all the land of Egypt."
\v 10 They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky; and it became a boil breaking forth with boils on woman and on animal.
\v 11 The magicians couldn't stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians.
\v 12 Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and she didn't listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses.
\v 13 Yahweh said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell her, 'This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\v 14 For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart, against your officials, and against your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.
\v 15 For now I would have put forth my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth;
\v 16 but indeed for this cause I have made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth;
\v 17 as you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won't let them go.
\v 18 Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.
\v 19 Now therefore command that all of your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter. Every woman and animal that is found in the field, and isn't brought home, the hail shall come down on them, and they shall die."'"
\v 20 Those who feared the word of Yahweh among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses.
\v 21 Whoever didn't regard the word of Yahweh left her servants and her livestock in the field.
\v 22 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch forth your hand toward the sky, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on woman, and on animal, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt."
\v 23 Moses stretched forth her rod toward the heavens, and Yahweh sent thunder, hail, and lightning flashed down to the earth. Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt.
\v 24 So there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
\v 25 The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both woman and animal; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.
\v 26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.
\v 27 Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, "I have sinned this time. Yahweh is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
\v 28 Pray to Yahweh; for there has been enough of mighty thunderings and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."
\v 29 Moses said to her, "As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to Yahweh. The thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you may know that the earth is Yahweh's.
\v 30 But as for you and your servants, I know that you don't yet fear Yahweh God."
\v 31 The flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.
\v 32 But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they had not grown up.
\v 33 Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad her hands to Yahweh; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.
\v 34 When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, she sinned yet more, and hardened her heart, she and her servants.
\v 35 The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and she didn't let the children of Israel go, just as Yahweh had spoken through Moses.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened her heart, and the heart of her servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them,
\v 2 and that you may tell in the hearing of your daughter, and of your daughter's daughter, what things I have done to Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know that I am Yahweh."
\v 3 Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to her, "This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.
\v 4 Or else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,
\v 5 and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one won't be able to see the earth. They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.
\v 6 Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither your mothers nor your mothers' mothers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.'" She turned, and went out from Pharaoh.
\v 7 Pharaoh's servants said to her, "How long will this woman be a snare to us? Let the women go, that they may serve Yahweh, their God. Don't you yet know that Egypt is destroyed?"
\v 8 Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and she said to them, "Go, serve Yahweh your God; but who are those who will go?"
\v 9 Moses said, "We will go with our young and with our old; with our daughters and with our sons, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh."
\v 10 She said to them, "Yahweh be with you if I will let you go with your little ones! See, evil is clearly before your faces.
\v 11 Not so! Go now you who are women, and serve Yahweh; for that is what you desire!" They were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
\v 12 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left."
\v 13 Moses stretched forth her rod over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
\v 14 The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
\v 15 For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
\v 16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and she said, "I have sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you.
\v 17 Now therefore please forgive my sin again, and pray to Yahweh your God, that she may also take away from me this death."
\v 18 She went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.
\v 19 Yahweh turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.
\v 20 But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and she didn't let the children of Israel go.
\v 21 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt."
\v 22 Moses stretched forth her hand toward the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.
\v 23 They didn't see one another, neither did anyone rise from her place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
\v 24 Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, "Go, serve Yahweh. Only let your flocks and your herds stay behind. Let your little ones also go with you."
\v 25 Moses said, "You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.
\v 26 Our livestock also shall go with us. There shall not a hoof be left behind, for of it we must take to serve Yahweh our God; and we don't know with what we must serve Yahweh, until we come there."
\v 27 But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and she wouldn't let them go.
\v 28 Pharaoh said to her, "Get away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!"
\v 29 Moses said, "You have spoken well. I will see your face again no more."

\c 11
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses, "Yet one plague more will I bring on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterwards she will let you go. When she lets you go, she will surely thrust you out altogether.
\v 2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every woman of her neighbor, and every man of his neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold."
\v 3 Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the woman Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.
\v 4 Moses said, "This is what Yahweh says: 'About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt,
\v 5 and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on her throne, even to the firstborn of the male servant who is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of livestock.
\v 6 There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor shall be any more.
\v 7 But against any of the children of Israel a dog won't even bark or move its tongue, against woman or animal; that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.
\v 8 All these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, "Get out, with all the people who follow you;" and after that I will go out.'" She went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
\v 9 Yahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh won't listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."
\v 10 Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and she didn't let the children of Israel go out of her land.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
\v 2 "This month shall be to you the beginning of months. It shall be the first month of the year to you.
\v 3 Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth day of this month, they shall take to them every woman a lamb, according to their mothers' houses, a lamb for a household;
\v 4 and if the household be too little for a lamb, then she and her neighbor next to her house shall take one according to the number of the souls; according to what everyone can eat you shall make your count for the lamb.
\v 5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a female a year old. You shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:
\v 6 and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening.
\v 7 They shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel, on the houses in which they shall eat it.
\v 8 They shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread. They shall eat it with bitter herbs.
\v 9 Don't eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; with its head, its legs and its inner parts.
\v 10 You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire.
\v 11 This is how you shall eat it: with your waist girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is Yahweh's Passover.
\v 12 For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both woman and animal. Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Yahweh.
\v 13 The blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be on you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.
\v 14 This day shall be to you for a memorial, and you shall keep it a feast to Yahweh: throughout your generations you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.
\v 15 "'Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
\v 16 In the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, except that which every woman must eat, that only may be done by you.
\v 17 You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall you observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever.
\v 18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty first day of the month at evening.
\v 19 Seven days shall there be no yeast found in your houses, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether she be a foreigner, or one who is born in the land.
\v 20 You shall eat nothing leavened. In all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.'"
\v 21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, "Draw out, and take lambs according to your families, and kill the Passover.
\v 22 You shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of her house until the morning.
\v 23 For Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when she sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two doorposts, Yahweh will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you.
\v 24 You shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your daughters forever.
\v 25 It shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh will give you, according as she has promised, that you shall keep this service.
\v 26 It will happen, when your children ask you, 'What do you mean by this service?'
\v 27 that you shall say, 'It is the sacrifice of Yahweh's Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when she struck the Egyptians, and spared our houses.'" The people bowed their heads and worshiped.
\v 28 The children of Israel went and did so; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
\v 29 It happened at midnight, that Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on her throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of livestock.
\v 30 Pharaoh rose up in the night, she, and all her servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
\v 31 She called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, "Rise up, get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said!
\v 32 Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also!"
\v 33 The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, "We are all dead women."
\v 34 The people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.
\v 35 The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing.
\v 36 Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. They despoiled the Egyptians.
\v 37 The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were women, besides children.
\v 38 A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much livestock.
\v 39 They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it wasn't leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn't wait, neither had they prepared for themselves any food.
\v 40 Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.
\v 41 It happened at the end of four hundred thirty years, even the same day it happened, that all the armies of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt.
\v 42 It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of Yahweh, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations.
\v 43 Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the ordinance of the Passover. There shall no foreigner eat of it,
\v 44 but every woman's servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised her, then shall she eat of it.
\v 45 A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.
\v 46 In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth anything of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall you break a bone of it.
\v 47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
\v 48 When a stranger shall live as a foreigner with you, and will keep the Passover to Yahweh, let all her females be circumcised, and then let her come near and keep it; and she shall be as one who is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.
\v 49 One law shall be to her who is born at home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you."
\v 50 Thus did all the children of Israel. As Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
\v 51 It happened the same day, that Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 "Sanctify to me all of the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of woman and of animal. It is mine."
\v 3 Moses said to the people, "Remember this day, in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten.
\v 4 This day you go forth in the month Abib.
\v 5 It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which she swore to your mothers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.
\v 6 Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh.
\v 7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall there be yeast seen with you, in all your borders.
\v 8 You shall tell your daughter in that day, saying, 'It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.'
\v 9 It shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt.
\v 10 You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
\v 11 "It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, as she swore to you and to your mothers, and shall give it you,
\v 12 that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb, and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal. The females shall be Yahweh's.
\v 13 Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of woman among your daughters.
\v 14 It shall be, when your daughter asks you in time to come, saying, 'What is this?' that you shall tell her, 'By strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage;
\v 15 and it happened, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of woman, and the firstborn of animal. Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that opens the womb, being females; but all the firstborn of my daughters I redeem.'
\v 16 It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between your eyes: for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt."
\v 17 It happened, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God didn't lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, "Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt;"
\v 18 but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.
\v 19 Moses took the bones of Josephine with her, for she had made the children of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you."
\v 20 They took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
\v 21 Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them on their way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:
\v 22 the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn't depart from before the people.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 "Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon. You shall encamp opposite it by the sea.
\v 3 Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, 'They are entangled in the land. The wilderness has shut them in.'
\v 4 I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and she will follow after them; and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all her armies; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh." They did so.
\v 5 It was told the queen of Egypt that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of her servants was changed towards the people, and they said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?"
\v 6 She made ready her chariot, and took her army with her;
\v 7 and she took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.
\v 8 Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh queen of Egypt, and she pursued after the children of Israel; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand.
\v 9 The Egyptians pursued after them: all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, her horsemen, and her army; and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon.
\v 10 When Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid. The children of Israel cried out to Yahweh.
\v 11 They said to Moses, "Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us forth out of Egypt?
\v 12 Isn't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?' For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness."
\v 13 Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh, which she will work for you today: for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall never see them again.
\v 14 Yahweh will fight for you, and you shall be still."
\v 15 Yahweh said to Moses, "Why do you cry to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward.
\v 16 Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.
\v 17 I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will get myself honor over Pharaoh, and over all her armies, over her chariots, and over her horsemen.
\v 18 The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over her chariots, and over her horsemen."
\v 19 The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them.
\v 20 It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one didn't come near the other all the night.
\v 21 Moses stretched out her hand over the sea, and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
\v 22 The children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
\v 23 The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea: all of Pharaoh's horses, her chariots, and her horsemen.
\v 24 It happened in the morning watch, that Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army.
\v 25 She took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, "Let's flee from the face of Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians!"
\v 26 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen."
\v 27 Moses stretched out her hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it. Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
\v 28 The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh's army that went in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them.
\v 29 But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
\v 30 Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
\v 31 Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did to the Egyptians, and the people feared Yahweh; and they believed in Yahweh, and in her servant Moses.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh, and said, "I will sing to Yahweh, for she has triumphed gloriously. The horse and her rider she has thrown into the sea.
\v 2 Yah is my strength and song. She has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise her; my mother's God, and I will exalt her.
\v 3 Yahweh is a woman of war. Yahweh is her name.
\v 4 She has cast Pharaoh's chariots and her army into the sea. Her chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.
\v 5 The deeps cover them. They went down into the depths like a stone.
\v 6 Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power. Your right hand, Yahweh, dashes the enemy in pieces.
\v 7 In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you. You send forth your wrath. It consumes them as stubble.
\v 8 With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up. The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
\v 9 The enemy said, 'I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide the spoil. My desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.'
\v 10 You blew with your wind. The sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
\v 11 Who is like you, Yahweh, among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?
\v 12 You stretched out your right hand. The earth swallowed them.
\v 13 "You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed. You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.
\v 14 The peoples have heard. They tremble. Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
\v 15 Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed. Trembling takes hold of the mighty women of Moab. All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.
\v 16 Terror and dread falls on them. By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone--until your people pass over, Yahweh, until the people pass over who you have purchased.
\v 17 You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, the place, Yahweh, which you have made for yourself to dwell in; the sanctuary, Domina, which your hands have established.
\v 18 Yahweh shall reign forever and ever."
\v 19 For the horses of Pharaoh went in with her chariots and with her horsemen into the sea, and Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.
\v 20 Miriam the prophet, the brother of Aaron, took a tambourine in his hand; and all the men went out after his with tambourines and with dances.
\v 21 Miriam answered them, "Sing to Yahweh, for she has triumphed gloriously. The horse and her rider she has thrown into the sea."
\v 22 Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
\v 23 When they came to Marah, they couldn't drink from the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah.
\v 24 The people murmured against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"
\v 25 Then she cried to Yahweh. Yahweh showed her a tree, and she threw it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There she made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there she tested them;
\v 26 and she said, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, and will do that which is right in her eyes, and will pay attention to her commandments, and keep all her statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you, which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh who heals you."
\v 27 They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 They took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
\v 2 The whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;
\v 3 and the children of Israel said to them, "We wish that we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots, when we ate our fill of bread, for you have brought us out into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger."
\v 4 Then said Yahweh to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from the sky for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.
\v 5 It shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily."
\v 6 Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, "At evening, then you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt;
\v 7 and in the morning, then you shall see the glory of Yahweh; because she hears your murmurings against Yahweh. Who are we, that you murmur against us?"
\v 8 Moses said, "Now Yahweh shall give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to satisfy you; because Yahweh hears your murmurings which you murmur against her. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh."
\v 9 Moses said to Aaron, "Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, 'Come near before Yahweh, for she has heard your murmurings.'"
\v 10 It happened, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud.
\v 11 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 12 "I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, 'At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread: and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God.'"
\v 13 It happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.
\v 14 When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground.
\v 15 When the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, "What is it?" For they didn't know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat."
\v 16 This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded: "Gather of it everyone according to her eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, shall you take it, every woman for those who are in her tent."
\v 17 The children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.
\v 18 When they measured it with an omer, she who gathered much had nothing over, and she who gathered little had no lack. They gathered every woman according to her eating.
\v 19 Moses said to them, "Let no one leave of it until the morning."
\v 20 Notwithstanding they didn't listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was angry with them.
\v 21 They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according to her eating. When the sun grew hot, it melted.
\v 22 It happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one, and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
\v 23 She said to them, "This is that which Yahweh has spoken, 'Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh. Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.'"
\v 24 They laid it up until the morning, as Moses asked, and it didn't become foul, neither was there any worm in it.
\v 25 Moses said, "Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh. Today you shall not find it in the field.
\v 26 Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none."
\v 27 It happened on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.
\v 28 Yahweh said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?
\v 29 Behold, because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath, therefore she gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days. Everyone stay in her place. Let no one go out of her place on the seventh day."
\v 30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
\v 31 The house of Israel called the name of it Manna, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers with honey.
\v 32 Moses said, "This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, 'Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.'"
\v 33 Moses said to Aaron, "Take a pot, and put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept throughout your generations."
\v 34 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
\v 35 The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.
\v 36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to Yahweh's commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to drink.
\v 2 Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, "Give us water to drink." Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test Yahweh?"
\v 3 The people were thirsty for water there; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"
\v 4 Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, "What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me."
\v 5 Yahweh said to Moses, "Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and go.
\v 6 Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink." Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
\v 7 She called the name of the place Massah,{Massah means testing.} and Meribah, because the children of Israel quarreled, and because they tested Yahweh, saying, "Is Yahweh among us, or not?"
\v 8 Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
\v 9 Moses said to Joshua, "Choose women for us, and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God's rod in my hand."
\v 10 So Joshua did as Moses had told her, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
\v 11 It happened, when Moses held up her hand, that Israel prevailed; and when she let down her hand, Amalek prevailed.
\v 12 But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under her, and she sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up her hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side. Her hands were steady until sunset.
\v 13 Joshua defeated Amalek and her people with the edge of the sword.
\v 14 Yahweh said to Moses, "Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky."
\v 15 Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Yahweh our Banner.
\v 16 She said, "Yah has sworn: 'Yahweh will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.'"

\c 18
\p
\v 1 Now Jethro, the priestess of Midian, Moses' mother-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel her people, how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt.
\v 2 Jethro, Moses' mother-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses' husband, after she had sent him away,
\v 3 and his two daughters. The name of one daughter was Gershom, for Moses said, "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land".
\v 4 The name of the other was Eliezer, for she said, "My mother's God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh's sword."
\v 5 Jethro, Moses' mother-in-law, came with her daughters and her husband to Moses into the wilderness where she was encamped, at the Mountain of God.
\v 6 She said to Moses, I, your mother-in-law Jethro, have come to you with your husband, and his two daughters with him.
\v 7 Moses went out to meet her mother-in-law, and bowed and kissed her. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent.
\v 8 Moses told her mother-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardships that had come on them on the way, and how Yahweh delivered them.
\v 9 Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel, in that she had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
\v 10 Jethro said, "Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
\v 11 Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods because of the thing in which they dealt arrogantly against them."
\v 12 Jethro, Moses' mother-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' mother-in-law before God.
\v 13 It happened on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening.
\v 14 When Moses' mother-in-law saw all that she did to the people, she said, "What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?"
\v 15 Moses said to her mother-in-law, "Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
\v 16 When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a woman and her neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and her laws."
\v 17 Moses' mother-in-law said to her, "The thing that you do is not good.
\v 18 You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone.
\v 19 Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and bring the causes to God.
\v 20 You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.
\v 21 Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able women, such as fear God: women of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
\v 22 Let them judge the people at all times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you.
\v 23 If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all of these people also will go to their place in peace."
\v 24 So Moses listened to the voice of her mother-in-law, and did all that she had said.
\v 25 Moses chose able women out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
\v 26 They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard causes to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
\v 27 Moses let her mother-in-law depart, and she went her way into her own land.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 In the third month after the children of Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
\v 2 When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain.
\v 3 Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to her out of the mountain, saying, "This is what you shall tell the house of Jacoba, and tell the children of Israel:
\v 4 'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.
\v 5 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine;
\v 6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.' These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel."
\v 7 Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Yahweh commanded her.
\v 8 All the people answered together, and said, "All that Yahweh has spoken we will do." Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.
\v 9 Yahweh said to Moses, "Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever." Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.
\v 10 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,
\v 11 and be ready against the third day; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.
\v 12 You shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, 'Be careful that you don't go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.
\v 13 No hand shall touch her, but she shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or woman, she shall not live.' When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain."
\v 14 Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
\v 15 She said to the people, "Be ready by the third day. Don't have sexual relations with a man."
\v 16 It happened on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.
\v 17 Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.
\v 18 Mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.
\v 19 When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered her by a voice.
\v 20 Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
\v 21 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish.
\v 22 Let the priests also, who come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves, lest Yahweh break forth on them."
\v 23 Moses said to Yahweh, "The people can't come up to Mount Sinai, for you charged us, saying, 'Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.'"
\v 24 Yahweh said to her, "Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you, but don't let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh, lest she break forth on them."
\v 25 So Moses went down to the people, and told them.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 God spoke all these words, saying,
\v 2 "I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
\v 3 You shall have no other gods before me.
\v 4 "You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
\v 5 you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the mothers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me,
\v 6 and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
\v 7 "You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain, for Yahweh will not hold her guiltless who takes her name in vain.
\v 8 "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
\v 9 You shall labor six days, and do all your work,
\v 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God. You shall not do any work in it, you, nor your daughter, nor your son, your female servant, nor your male servant, nor your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates;
\v 11 for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day, and made it holy.
\v 12 "Honor your mother and your father, that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
\v 13 "You shall not murder.
\v 14 "You shall not commit adultery.
\v 15 "You shall not steal.
\v 16 "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
\v 17 "You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's husband, nor her female servant, nor her male servant, nor her ox, nor her donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's."
\v 18 All the people perceived the thunderings, the lightnings, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at a distance.
\v 19 They said to Moses, "Speak with us yourself, and we will listen; but don't let God speak with us, lest we die."
\v 20 Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid, for God has come to test you, and that her fear may be before you, that you won't sin."
\v 21 The people stayed at a distance, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
\v 22 Yahweh said to Moses, "This is what you shall tell the children of Israel: 'You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
\v 23 You shall most certainly not make alongside of me gods of silver, or gods of gold for yourselves.
\v 24 You shall make an altar of earth for me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you.
\v 25 If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stones; for if you lift up your tool on it, you have polluted it.
\v 26 Neither shall you go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed to it.'

\c 21
\p
\v 1 "Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them.
\v 2 "If you buy a Hebrew servant, she shall serve six years and in the seventh she shall go out free without paying anything.
\v 3 If she comes in by herself, she shall go out by herself. If she is married, then her husband shall go out with her.
\v 4 If her master gives her a husband and he bears her daughters or sons, the husband and his children shall be his master's, and she shall go out by herself.
\v 5 But if the servant shall plainly say, 'I love my master, my husband, and my children. I will not go out free;'
\v 6 then her master shall bring her to God, and shall bring her to the door or to the doorpost, and her master shall bore her ear through with an awl, and she shall serve her for ever.
\v 7 "If a woman sells her son to be a male servant, he shall not go out as the female servants do.
\v 8 If he doesn't please his master, who has married him to herself, then she shall let him be redeemed. She shall have no right to sell him to a foreign people, seeing she has dealt deceitfully with him.
\v 9 If she marries him to her daughter, she shall deal with him after the manner of sons.
\v 10 If she takes another husband to herself, she shall not diminish his food, his clothing, and his marital rights.
\v 11 If she doesn't do these three things for him, he may go free without paying any money.
\v 12 "One who strikes a woman so that she dies shall surely be put to death,
\v 13 but not if it is unintentional, but God allows it to happen: then I will appoint you a place where she shall flee.
\v 14 If a woman schemes and comes presumptuously on her neighbor to kill her, you shall take her from my altar, that she may die.
\v 15 "Anyone who attacks her mother or her father shall be surely put to death.
\v 16 "Anyone who kidnaps someone and sells her, or if she is found in her hand, she shall surely be put to death.
\v 17 "Anyone who curses her mother or her father shall surely be put to death.
\v 18 "If women quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone, or with her fist, and she doesn't die, but is confined to bed;
\v 19 if she rises again and walks around with her staff, then she who struck her shall be cleared: only she shall pay for the loss of her time, and shall provide for her healing until she is thoroughly healed.
\v 20 "If a woman strikes her servant or her maid with a rod, and she dies under her hand, she shall surely be punished.
\v 21 Notwithstanding, if she gets up after a day or two, she shall not be punished, for she is her property.
\v 22 "If women fight and hurt a pregnant man so that he gives birth prematurely, and yet no harm follows, she shall be surely fined as much as the man's wife demands and the judges allow.
\v 23 But if any harm follows, then you must take life for life,
\v 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
\v 25 burning for burning, wound for wound, and bruise for bruise.
\v 26 "If a woman strikes her servant's eye, or her maid's eye, and destroys it, she shall let her go free for her eye's sake.
\v 27 If she strikes out her female servant's tooth, or her male servant's tooth, she shall let her go free for her tooth's sake.
\v 28 "If a bull gores a woman or a man to death, the bull shall surely be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the bull shall not be held responsible.
\v 29 But if the bull had a habit of goring in the past, and it has been testified to its owner, and she has not kept it in, but it has killed a woman or a man, the bull shall be stoned, and its owner shall also be put to death.
\v 30 If a ransom is laid on her, then she shall give for the redemption of her life whatever is laid on her.
\v 31 Whether it has gored a daughter or has gored a son, according to this judgment it shall be done to her.
\v 32 If the bull gores a female servant or a male servant, thirty shekels of silver shall be given to their master, and the ox shall be stoned.
\v 33 "If a woman opens a pit, or if a woman digs a pit and doesn't cover it, and a bull or a donkey falls into it,
\v 34 the owner of the pit shall make it good. She shall give money to its owner, and the dead animal shall be hers.
\v 35 "If one woman's bull injures another's, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live bull, and divide its price; and they shall also divide the dead animal.
\v 36 Or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of goring in the past, and its owner has not kept it in, she shall surely pay bull for bull, and the dead animal shall be her own.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 "If a woman steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it, or sells it; she shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
\v 2 If the thief is found breaking in, and is struck so that she dies, there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for her.
\v 3 If the sun has risen on her, there shall be guilt of bloodshed for her; she shall make restitution. If she has nothing, then she shall be sold for her theft.
\v 4 If the stolen property is found in her hand alive, whether it is ox, donkey, or sheep, she shall pay double.
\v 5 "If a woman causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and lets her animal loose, and it grazes in another woman's field, she shall make restitution from the best of her own field, and from the best of her own vineyard.
\v 6 "If fire breaks out, and catches in thorns so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed; she who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
\v 7 "If a woman delivers to her neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it is stolen out of the woman's house; if the thief is found, she shall pay double.
\v 8 If the thief isn't found, then the master of the house shall come near to God, to find out if she hasn't put her hand to her neighbor's goods.
\v 9 For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, or for any kind of lost thing, about which one says, 'This is mine,' the cause of both parties shall come before God. She whom God condemns shall pay double to her neighbor.
\v 10 "If a woman delivers to her neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep, and it dies or is injured, or driven away, no woman seeing it;
\v 11 the oath of Yahweh shall be between them both, whether she hasn't put her hand to her neighbor's goods; and the owner of it shall accept it, and she shall not make restitution.
\v 12 But if it is stolen from her, she shall make restitution to the owner of it.
\v 13 If it is torn in pieces, let her bring it for evidence. She shall not make good that which was torn.
\v 14 "If a woman borrows anything of her neighbor's, and it is injured, or dies, the owner of it not being with it, she shall surely make restitution.
\v 15 If the owner of it is with it, she shall not make it good. If it is a leased thing, it came for its lease.
\v 16 "If a woman entices a virgin who isn't pledged to be married, and lies with him, she shall surely pay a dowry for him to be her husband.
\v 17 If his mother utterly refuses to give him to her, she shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
\v 18 "You shall not allow a sorceress to live.
\v 19 "Whoever has sex with an animal shall surely be put to death.
\v 20 "She who sacrifices to any god, except to Yahweh only, shall be utterly destroyed.
\v 21 "You shall not wrong an alien, neither shall you oppress her, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.
\v 22 "You shall not take advantage of any widower or fatherless child.
\v 23 If you take advantage of them at all, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry;
\v 24 and my wrath will grow hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your husbands shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
\v 25 "If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor, you shall not be to her as a creditor; neither shall you charge her interest.
\v 26 If you take your neighbor's garment as collateral, you shall restore it to her before the sun goes down,
\v 27 for that is her only covering, it is her garment for her skin. What would she sleep in? It will happen, when she cries to me, that I will hear, for I am gracious.
\v 28 "You shall not blaspheme God, nor curse a ruler of your people.
\v 29 "You shall not delay to offer from your harvest and from the outflow of your presses. "You shall give the firstborn of your daughters to me.
\v 30 You shall do likewise with your oxen and with your sheep. Seven days it shall be with its father, then on the eighth day you shall give it me.
\v 31 "You shall be holy women to me, therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals in the field. You shall cast it to the dogs.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 "You shall not spread a false report. Don't join your hand with the wicked to be a malicious witness.
\v 2 You shall not follow a crowd to do evil; neither shall you testify in court to side with a multitude to pervert justice;
\v 3 neither shall you favor a poor woman in her cause.
\v 4 "If you meet your enemy's ox or her donkey going astray, you shall surely bring it back to her again.
\v 5 If you see the donkey of her who hates you fallen down under her burden, don't leave her, you shall surely help her with it.
\v 6 "You shall not deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits.
\v 7 "Keep far from a false charge, and don't kill the innocent and righteous: for I will not justify the wicked.
\v 8 "You shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds those who have sight and perverts the words of the righteous.
\v 9 "You shall not oppress an alien, for you know the heart of an alien, seeing you were aliens in the land of Egypt.
\v 10 "For six years you shall sow your land, and shall gather in its increase,
\v 11 but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave the animal of the field shall eat. In like manner you shall deal with your vineyard and with your olive grove.
\v 12 "Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest, that your ox and your donkey may have rest, and the daughter of your houseboy, and the alien may be refreshed.
\v 13 "Be careful to do all things that I have said to you; and don't invoke the name of other gods, neither let them be heard out of your mouth.
\v 14 "You shall observe a feast to me three times a year.
\v 15 You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it you came out from Egypt), and no one shall appear before me empty.
\v 16 And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you sow in the field: and the feast of harvest, at the end of the year, when you gather in your labors out of the field.
\v 17 Three times in the year all your females shall appear before the Domina Yahweh.
\v 18 "You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread, neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning.
\v 19 The first of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring into the house of Yahweh your God. "You shall not boil a kid in its father's milk.
\v 20 "Behold, I send an angel before you, to keep you by the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.
\v 21 Pay attention to her, and listen to her voice. Don't provoke her, for she will not pardon your disobedience, for my name is in her.
\v 22 But if you indeed listen to her voice, and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies, and an adversary to your adversaries.
\v 23 For my angel shall go before you, and bring you in to the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off.
\v 24 You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor follow their practices, but you shall utterly overthrow them and demolish their pillars.
\v 25 You shall serve Yahweh your God, and she will bless your bread and your water, and I will take sickness away from your midst.
\v 26 No one will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will fulfill the number of your days.
\v 27 I will send my terror before you, and will confuse all the people to whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.
\v 28 I will send the hornet before you, which will drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before you.
\v 29 I will not drive them out from before you in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the animals of the field multiply against you.
\v 30 Little by little I will drive them out from before you, until you have increased and inherit the land.
\v 31 I will set your border from the Red Sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you.
\v 32 You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
\v 33 They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me, for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you."

\v 1 She said to Moses, "Come up to Yahweh, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship from a distance.
\v 2 Moses alone shall come near to Yahweh, but they shall not come near, neither shall the people go up with her."
\v 3 Moses came and told the people all the words of Yahweh, and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, "All the words which Yahweh has spoken will we do."
\v 4 Moses wrote all the words of Yahweh, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mountain, and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.
\v 5 She sent young women of the children of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to Yahweh.
\v 6 Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood she sprinkled on the altar.
\v 7 She took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people, and they said, "All that Yahweh has spoken will we do, and be obedient."
\v 8 Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, "Look, this is the blood of the covenant, which Yahweh has made with you concerning all these words."
\v 9 Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up.
\v 10 They saw the God of Israel. Under her feet was like a paved work of sapphire stone, like the skies for clearness.
\v 11 She didn't lay her hand on the nobles of the children of Israel. They saw God, and ate and drank.
\v 12 Yahweh said to Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain, and stay here, and I will give you the tables of stone with the law and the commands that I have written, that you may teach them."
\v 13 Moses rose up with Joshua, her servant, and Moses went up onto God's Mountain.
\v 14 She said to the elders, "Wait here for us, until we come again to you. Behold, Aaron and Hur are with you. Whoever is involved in a dispute can go to them."
\v 15 Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.
\v 16 The glory of Yahweh settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. The seventh day she called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
\v 17 The appearance of the glory of Yahweh was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel.
\v 18 Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up on the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.

\v 34 If anything of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remains to the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
\v 35 "Thus shall you do to Aaron, and to her daughters, according to all that I have commanded you. Seven days shall you consecrate them.
\v 36 Every day shall you offer the bull of sin offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when you make atonement for it; and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.
\v 37 Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar shall be most holy; whatever touches the altar shall be holy.
\v 38 "Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually.
\v 39 The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb you shall offer at evening:
\v 40 and with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering.
\v 41 The other lamb you shall offer at evening, and shall do to it according to the meal offering of the morning, and according to its drink offering, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
\v 42 It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Yahweh, where I will meet with you, to speak there to you.
\v 43 There I will meet with the children of Israel; and the place shall be sanctified by my glory.
\v 44 I will sanctify the tent of meeting and the altar: Aaron also and her daughters I will sanctify, to minister to me in the priestess's office.
\v 45 I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.
\v 46 They shall know that I am Yahweh their God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them: I am Yahweh their God.

\v 1 "You shall make an altar to burn incense on. You shall make it of acacia wood.
\v 2 Its length shall be a cubit, and its breadth a cubit. It shall be square, and its height shall be two cubits. Its horns shall be of one piece with it.
\v 3 You shall overlay it with pure gold, the top of it, the sides of it around it, and its horns; and you shall make a gold molding around it.
\v 4 You shall make two golden rings for it under its molding; on its two ribs, on its two sides you shall make them; and they shall be for places for poles with which to bear it.
\v 5 You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.
\v 6 You shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with you.
\v 7 Aaron shall burn incense of sweet spices on it every morning. When she tends the lamps, she shall burn it.
\v 8 When Aaron lights the lamps at evening, she shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Yahweh throughout your generations.
\v 9 You shall offer no strange incense on it, nor burnt offering, nor meal offering; and you shall pour no drink offering on it.
\v 10 Aaron shall make atonement on its horns once in the year; with the blood of the sin offering of atonement once in the year she shall make atonement for it throughout your generations. It is most holy to Yahweh."
\v 11 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 12 "When you take a census of the children of Israel, according to those who are numbered among them, then each woman shall give a ransom for her soul to Yahweh, when you number them; that there be no plague among them when you number them.
\v 13 They shall give this, everyone who passes over to those who are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary; (the shekel is twenty gerahs;) half a shekel for an offering to Yahweh.
\v 14 Everyone who passes over to those who are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering to Yahweh.
\v 15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of Yahweh, to make atonement for your souls.
\v 16 You shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shall appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh, to make atonement for your souls."
\v 17 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 18 "You shall also make a basin of brass, and the base of it of brass, in which to wash. You shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.
\v 19 Aaron and her daughters shall wash their hands and their feet in it.
\v 20 When they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they not die; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
\v 21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they not die: and it shall be a statute forever to them, even to her and to her descendants throughout their generations."
\v 22 Moreover Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 23 "Also take fine spices: of liquid myrrh, five hundred shekels; and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, even two hundred and fifty; and of fragrant cane, two hundred and fifty;
\v 24 and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary; and a hin of olive oil.
\v 25 You shall make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil.
\v 26 You shall use it to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony,
\v 27 the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its accessories, the altar of incense,
\v 28 the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its base.
\v 29 You shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy. Whatever touches them shall be holy.
\v 30 You shall anoint Aaron and her daughters, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priestess's office.
\v 31 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'This shall be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations.
\v 32 It shall not be poured on woman's flesh, neither shall you make any like it, according to its composition: it is holy. It shall be holy to you.
\v 33 Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, she shall be cut off from her people.'"
\v 34 Yahweh said to Moses, "Take to yourself sweet spices, gum resin, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be an equal weight;
\v 35 and you shall make incense of it, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy:
\v 36 and you shall beat some of it very small, and put some of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be to you most holy.
\v 37 The incense which you shall make, according to its composition you shall not make for yourselves: it shall be to you holy for Yahweh.
\v 38 Whoever shall make any like that, to smell of it, she shall be cut off from her people."

\c 31
\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 "Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the daughter of Uri, the daughter of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:
\v 3 and I have filled her with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
\v 4 to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
\v 5 and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.
\v 6 I, behold, I have appointed with her Oholiab, the daughter of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you:
\v 7 the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent,
\v 8 the table and its vessels, the pure lampstand with all its vessels, the altar of incense,
\v 9 the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, the basin and its base,
\v 10 the finely worked garments--the holy garments for Aaron the priestess-- the garments of her daughters to minister in the priestess's office,
\v 11 the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you they shall do."
\v 12 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 13 "Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, 'Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you.
\v 14 You shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among her people.
\v 15 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.
\v 16 Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.
\v 17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day she rested, and was refreshed.'"
\v 18 She gave to Moses, when she finished speaking with her on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets, written with God's finger.

\c 32
\p
\v 1 When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to her, "Come, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the woman who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of her."
\v 2 Aaron said to them, "Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your husbands, of your daughters, and of your sons, and bring them to me."
\v 3 All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.
\v 4 She received what they handed her, and fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said, "These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt."
\v 5 When Aaron saw this, she built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh."
\v 6 They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
\v 7 Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Go, get down; for your people, who you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves!
\v 8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, 'These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.'"
\v 9 Yahweh said to Moses, "I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.
\v 10 Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation."
\v 11 Moses begged Yahweh her God, and said, "Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
\v 12 Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, 'She brought them forth for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?' Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.
\v 13 Remember Abrahai, Isaaca, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, 'I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed, and they shall inherit it forever.'"
\v 14 Yahweh repented of the evil which she said she would do to her people.
\v 15 Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the testimony in her hand; tablets that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other they were written.
\v 16 The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tables.
\v 17 When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, she said to Moses, "There is the noise of war in the camp."
\v 18 She said, "It isn't the voice of those who shout for victory, neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear."
\v 19 It happened, as soon as she came near to the camp, that she saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses' anger grew hot, and she threw the tablets out of her hands, and broke them beneath the mountain.
\v 20 She took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
\v 21 Moses said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?"
\v 22 Aaron said, "Don't let the anger of my domina grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.
\v 23 For they said to me, 'Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the woman who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of her.'
\v 24 I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them take it off:' so they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."
\v 25 When Moses saw that the people had broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies),
\v 26 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is on Yahweh's side, come to me!" All the daughters of Levia gathered themselves together to her.
\v 27 She said to them, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Every woman put her sword on her thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every woman kill her sister, and every woman her companion, and every woman her neighbor.'"
\v 28 The daughters of Levia did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand women.
\v 29 Moses said, "Consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh, yes, every woman against her daughter, and against her sister; that she may bestow on you a blessing this day."
\v 30 It happened on the next day, that Moses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin. Now I will go up to Yahweh. Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin."
\v 31 Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, "Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.
\v 32 Yet now, if you will, forgive their sin--and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have written."
\v 33 Yahweh said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me, her will I blot out of my book.
\v 34 Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin."
\v 35 Yahweh struck the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.

\c 33
\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Depart, go up from here, you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abrahai, to Isaaca, and to Jacoba, saying, 'I will give it to your seed.'
\v 2 I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
\v 3 to a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you in the way."
\v 4 When the people heard this evil news, they mourned: and no one put on her jewelry.
\v 5 Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell the children of Israel, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go up into your midst for one moment, I would consume you. Therefore now take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.'"
\v 6 The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.
\v 7 Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and she called it "The tent of meeting." It happened that everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.
\v 8 It happened that when Moses went out to the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until she had gone into the Tent.
\v 9 It happened, when Moses entered into the Tent, that the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and spoke with Moses.
\v 10 All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshiped, everyone at their tent door.
\v 11 Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a woman speaks to her friend. She turned again into the camp, but her servant Joshua, the daughter of Nun, a young woman, didn't depart out of the Tent.
\v 12 Moses said to Yahweh, "Behold, you tell me, 'Bring up this people:' and you haven't let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.'
\v 13 Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people."
\v 14 She said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
\v 15 She said to her, "If your presence doesn't go with me, don't carry us up from here.
\v 16 For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Isn't it in that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who are on the surface of the earth?"
\v 17 Yahweh said to Moses, "I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."
\v 18 She said, "Please show me your glory."
\v 19 She said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy."
\v 20 She said, "You cannot see my face, for woman may not see me and live."
\v 21 Yahweh also said, "Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on the rock.
\v 22 It will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by;
\v 23 then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back; but my face shall not be seen."

\c 34
\p
\v 1 Yahweh said to Moses, "Chisel two stone tablets like the first: and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.
\v 2 Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.
\v 3 No one shall come up with you; neither let anyone be seen throughout all the mountain; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mountain."
\v 4 She chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded her, and took in her hand two stone tablets.
\v 5 Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with her there, and proclaimed the name of Yahweh.
\v 6 Yahweh passed by before her, and proclaimed, "Yahweh! Yahweh, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth,
\v 7 keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the mothers on the children, and on the children's children, on the third and on the fourth generation."
\v 8 Moses hurried and bowed her head toward the earth, and worshiped.
\v 9 She said, "If now I have found favor in your sight, Domina, please let the Domina go in the midst of us; although this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance."
\v 10 She said, "Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which you are shall see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you.
\v 11 Observe that which I command you this day. Behold, I drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
\v 12 Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare in the midst of you:
\v 13 but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherim;
\v 14 for you shall worship no other god: for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
\v 15 Don't make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the philanderer after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you and you eat of her sacrifice;
\v 16 and you take of their sons to your daughters, and their sons play the philanderer after their gods, and make your daughters play the philanderer after their gods.
\v 17 You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.
\v 18 "You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.
\v 19 All that opens the womb is mine; and all your livestock that is female, the firstborn of cow and sheep.
\v 20 The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your daughters you shall redeem. No one shall appear before me empty.
\v 21 "Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.
\v 22 You shall observe the feast of weeks with the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of harvest at the year's end.
\v 23 Three times in the year all your females shall appear before the Domina Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 24 For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither shall any woman desire your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh, your God, three times in the year.
\v 25 "You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning.
\v 26 You shall bring the first of the first fruits of your ground to the house of Yahweh your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its father's milk."
\v 27 Yahweh said to Moses, "Write you these words: for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."
\v 28 She was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights; she neither ate bread, nor drank water. She wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
\v 29 It happened, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in Moses' hand, when she came down from the mountain, that Moses didn't know that the skin of her face shone by reason of her speaking with her.
\v 30 When Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of her face shone; and they were afraid to come near her.
\v 31 Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to her; and Moses spoke to them.
\v 32 Afterward all the children of Israel came near, and she gave them all of the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with her on Mount Sinai.
\v 33 When Moses was done speaking with them, she put a veil on her face.
\v 34 But when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with her, she took the veil off, until she came out; and she came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which she was commanded.
\v 35 The children of Israel saw Moses' face, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil on her face again, until she went in to speak with her.

\c 35
\p
\v 1 Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said to them, "These are the words which Yahweh has commanded, that you should do them.
\v 2 'Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of solemn rest to Yahweh: whoever does any work in it shall be put to death.
\v 3 You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on the Sabbath day.'"
\v 4 Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, "This is the thing which Yahweh commanded, saying,
\v 5 'Take from among you an offering to Yahweh. Whoever is of a willing heart, let her bring it, Yahweh's offering: gold, silver, brass,
\v 6 blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair,
\v 7 rams' skins dyed red, sea cow hides, acacia wood,
\v 8 oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense,
\v 9 onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate.
\v 10 "'Let every wise-hearted woman among you come, and make all that Yahweh has commanded:
\v 11 the tent, its outer covering, its roof, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;
\v 12 the ark, and its poles, the mercy seat, the veil of the screen;
\v 13 the table with its poles and all its vessels, and the show bread;
\v 14 the lampstand also for the light, with its vessels, its lamps, and the oil for the light;
\v 15 and the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, the screen for the door, at the door of the tent;
\v 16 the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of brass, it poles, and all its vessels, the basin and its base;
\v 17 the hangings of the court, its pillars, their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;
\v 18 the pins of the tent, the pins of the court, and their cords;
\v 19 the finely worked garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priestess, and the garments of her daughters, to minister in the priestess's office.'"
\v 20 All the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
\v 21 They came, everyone whose heart stirred her up, and everyone whom her spirit made willing, and brought Yahweh's offering, for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all of its service, and for the holy garments.
\v 22 They came, both women and men, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought brooches, earrings, signet rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every woman who offered an offering of gold to Yahweh.
\v 23 Everyone, with whom was found blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair, rams' skins dyed red, and sea cow hides, brought them.
\v 24 Everyone who did offer an offering of silver and brass brought Yahweh's offering; and everyone, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.
\v 25 All the men who were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen.
\v 26 All the men whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' hair.
\v 27 The rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod and for the breastplate;
\v 28 and the spice, and the oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.
\v 29 The children of Israel brought a freewill offering to Yahweh; every woman and man, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which Yahweh had commanded to be made by Moses.
\v 30 Moses said to the children of Israel, "Behold, Yahweh has called by name Bezalel the daughter of Uri, the daughter of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
\v 31 She has filled her with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;
\v 32 and to make skillful works, to work in gold, in silver, in brass,
\v 33 in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of skillful workmanship.
\v 34 She has put in her heart that she may teach, both she, and Oholiab, the daughter of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
\v 35 She has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the engraver, of the skillful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do any workmanship, and of those who make skillful works.

\c 36
\p
\v 1 "Bezalel and Oholiab shall work with every wise-hearted woman, in whom Yahweh has put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that Yahweh has commanded."
\v 2 Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted woman, in whose heart Yahweh had put wisdom, even everyone whose heart stirred her up to come to the work to do it:
\v 3 and they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, with which to make it. They brought yet to her freewill offerings every morning.
\v 4 All the wise women, who performed all the work of the sanctuary, each came from her work which they did.
\v 5 They spoke to Moses, saying, "The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Yahweh commanded to make."
\v 6 Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, "Let neither woman nor man make anything else for the offering for the sanctuary." So the people were restrained from bringing.
\v 7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
\v 8 All the wise-hearted women among those who did the work made the tent with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skillful workman, they made them.
\v 9 The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains had one measure.
\v 10 She coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains she coupled one to another.
\v 11 She made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from the edge in the coupling. Likewise she made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling.
\v 12 She made fifty loops in the one curtain, and she made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling. The loops were opposite one to another.
\v 13 She made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tent was a unit.
\v 14 She made curtains of goats' hair for a covering over the tent. She made them eleven curtains.

\v 2 She made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.
\v 3 They beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, in the purple, in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skillful workman.
\v 4 They made shoulder straps for it, joined together. At the two ends it was joined together.
\v 5 The skillfully woven band that was on it, with which to fasten it on, was of the same piece, like its work; of gold, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen; as Yahweh commanded Moses.

\v 14 The stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, everyone according to her name, for the twelve tribes.
\v 15 They made on the breastplate chains like cords, of braided work of pure gold.
\v 16 They made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.
\v 17 They put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.

\v 23 The opening of the robe in the midst of it was like the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding around its opening, that it should not be torn.
\v 24 They made on the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, purple, scarlet, and twined linen.
\v 25 They made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates around the skirts of the robe, between the pomegranates;

\v 28 and the turban of fine linen, and the linen headbands of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,
\v 29 and the sash of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 30 They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it a writing, like the engravings of a signet: "HOLY TO YAHWEH."
\v 31 They tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on the turban above, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 32 Thus all the work of the tent of the tent of meeting was finished. The children of Israel did according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses; so they did.
\v 33 They brought the tent to Moses, the tent, with all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,
\v 34 the covering of rams' skins dyed red, the covering of sea cow hides, the veil of the screen,

\v 43 Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it as Yahweh had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.

\c 40
\p
\v 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 "On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tent of the Tent of Meeting.
\v 3 You shall put the ark of the testimony in it, and you shall screen the ark with the veil.
\v 4 You shall bring in the table, and set in order the things that are on it. You shall bring in the lampstand, and light the lamps of it.
\v 5 You shall set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tent.
\v 6 You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tent of the tent of meeting.
\v 7 You shall set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shall put water therein.
\v 8 You shall set up the court around it, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.
\v 9 You shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tent, and all that is in it, and shall make it holy, and all its furniture: and it will be holy.
\v 10 You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar will be most holy.
\v 11 You shall anoint the basin and its base, and sanctify it.
\v 12 You shall bring Aaron and her daughters to the door of the tent of meeting, and shall wash them with water.
\v 13 You shall put on Aaron the holy garments; and you shall anoint her, and sanctify her, that she may minister to me in the priestess's office.
\v 14 You shall bring her daughters, and put coats on them.
\v 15 You shall anoint them, as you anointed their mother, that they may minister to me in the priestess's office. Their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations."
\v 16 Moses did so. According to all that Yahweh commanded her, so she did.
\v 17 It happened in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tent was raised up.
\v 18 Moses raised up the tent, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards of it, and put in the bars of it, and raised up its pillars.
\v 19 She spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof of the tent above on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 20 She took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark.
\v 21 She brought the ark into the tent, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 22 She put the table in the tent of meeting, on the side of the tent northward, outside of the veil.
\v 23 She set the bread in order on it before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 24 She put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table, on the side of the tent southward.
\v 25 She lit the lamps before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 26 She put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil;
\v 27 and she burnt incense of sweet spices on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 28 She put up the screen of the door to the tent.
\v 29 She set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tent of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the meal offering, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 30 She set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, with which to wash.
\v 31 Moses, Aaron, and her daughters washed their hands and their feet there.
\v 32 When they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 33 She raised up the court around the tent and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
\v 34 Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Yahweh filled the tent.
\v 35 Moses wasn't able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and Yahweh's glory filled the tent.
\v 36 When the cloud was taken up from over the tent, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys;
\v 37 but if the cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't travel until the day that it was taken up.
\v 38 For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tent by day, and there was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
