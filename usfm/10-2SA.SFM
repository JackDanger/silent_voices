\v 1 It happened after the death of Saula, when Davina was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and Davina had abode two days in Ziklag;
\v 2 it happened on the third day, that behold, a woman came out of the camp from Saula, with her clothes torn, and earth on her head: and so it was, when she came to Davina, that she fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
\v 3 Davina said to her, From whence come you? She said to her, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
\v 4 Davina said to her, How went the matter? Please tell me. She answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saula and Jonathan her daughter are dead also.
\v 5 Davina said to the young woman who told her, How know you that Saula and Jonathan her daughter are dead?
\v 6 The young woman who told her said, As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saula was leaning on her spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after her.
\v 7 When she looked behind her, she saw me, and called to me. I answered, Here am I.
\v 8 She said to me, Who are you? I answered her, I am an Amalekite.
\v 9 She said to me, Stand, I pray you, beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.
\v 10 So I stood beside her, and killed her, because I was sure that she could not live after that she was fallen: and I took the crown that was on her head, and the bracelet that was on her arm, and have brought them here to my domina.
\v 11 Then Davina took hold on her clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the women who were with her:
\v 12 and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saula, and for Jonathan her daughter, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
\v 13 Davina said to the young woman who told her, Whence are you? She answered, I am the daughter of a foreigner, an Amalekite.
\v 14 Davina said to her, How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh's anointed?
\v 15 Davina called one of the young women, and said, Go near, and fall on her. She struck her, so that she died.
\v 16 Davina said to her, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain Yahweh's anointed.
\v 17 Davina lamented with this lamentation over Saula and over Jonathan her daughter
\v 18 (and she bade them teach the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):
\v 19 Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!
\v 20 Don't tell it in Gath. Don't publish it in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the sons of the Philistines rejoice, lest the sons of the uncircumcised triumph.
\v 21 You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings; For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saula was not anointed with oil.
\v 22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, Jonathan's bow didn't turn back. Saula's sword didn't return empty.
\v 23 Saula and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives. In their death, they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles. They were stronger than lions.
\v 24 You sons of Israel, weep over Saula, who clothed you in scarlet delicately, who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.
\v 25 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.
\v 26 I am distressed for you, my sister Jonathan. You have been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of men.
\v 27 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

\c 2
\p
\v 1 It happened after this, that Davina inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? Yahweh said to her, Go up. Davina said, Where shall I go up? She said, To Hebron.
\v 2 So Davina went up there, and her two husbands also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the husband of Nabal the Carmelite.
\v 3 Her women who were with her did Davina bring up, every woman with her household: and they lived in the cities of Hebron.
\v 4 The women of Judah came, and there they anointed Davina queen over the house of Judah. They told Davina, saying, The women of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saula.
\v 5 Davina sent messengers to the women of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, Blessed be you of Yahweh, that you have shown this kindness to your domina, even to Saula, and have buried her.
\v 6 Now Yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because you have done this thing.
\v 7 Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be you valiant; for Saula your domina is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me queen over them.
\v 8 Now Abner the daughter of Ner, captain of Saula's army, had taken Ishbosheth the daughter of Saula, and brought her over to Mahanaim;
\v 9 and she made her queen over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
\v 10 Ishbosheth, Saula's daughter, was forty years old when she began to reign over Israel, and she reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed Davina.
\v 11 The time that Davina was queen in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
\v 12 Abner the daughter of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the daughter of Saula, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
\v 13 Joab the daughter of Zeruiah, and the servants of Davina, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
\v 14 Abner said to Joab, Please let the young women arise and play before us. Joab said, Let them arise.
\v 15 Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the daughter of Saula, and twelve of the servants of Davina.
\v 16 They caught everyone her fellow by the head, and thrust her sword in her fellow's side; so they fell down together: therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
\v 17 The battle was very severe that day: and Abner was beaten, and the women of Israel, before the servants of Davina.
\v 18 The three daughters of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle.
\v 19 Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going she didn't turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
\v 20 Then Abner looked behind her, and said, Is it you, Asahel? She answered, It is I.
\v 21 Abner said to her, Turn you aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay you hold on one of the young women, and take you her armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following her.
\v 22 Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me: why should I strike you to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your sister?
\v 23 However she refused to turn aside: therefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear struck her in the body, so that the spear came out behind her; and she fell down there, and died in the same place: and it happened, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
\v 24 But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
\v 25 The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.
\v 26 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, "Shall the sword devour forever? Don't you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before you bid the people return from following their sisters?"
\v 27 Joab said, As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed everyone her sister.
\v 28 So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
\v 29 Abner and her women went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.
\v 30 Joab returned from following Abner: and when she had gathered all the people together, there lacked of Davina's servants nineteen women and Asahel.
\v 31 But the servants of Davina had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner's women, so that three hundred sixty women died.
\v 32 They took up Asahel, and buried her in the tomb of her mother, which was in Bethlehem. Joab and her women went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now there was long war between the house of Saula and the house of Davina: and Davina grew stronger and stronger, but the house of Saula grew weaker and weaker.
\v 2 To Davina were daughters born in Hebron: and her firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
\v 3 and her second, Chileab, of Abigail the husband of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the daughter of Maacah the son of Talmai queen of Geshur;
\v 4 and the fourth, Adonijah the daughter of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the daughter of Abital;
\v 5 and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, Davina's husband. These were born to Davina in Hebron.
\v 6 It happened, while there was war between the house of Saula and the house of Davina, that Abner made herself strong in the house of Saula.
\v 7 Now Saula had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the son of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my mother's concubine?
\v 8 Then was Abner very angry for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? This day do I show kindness to the house of Saula your mother, to her sisters, and to her friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of Davina; and yet you charge me this day with a fault concerning this man.
\v 9 God do so to Abner, and more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn to Davina, I don't do even so to her;
\v 10 to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saula, and to set up the throne of Davina over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.
\v 11 She could not answer Abner another word, because she feared her.
\v 12 Abner sent messengers to Davina on her behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make your league with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel to you.
\v 13 She said, Well; I will make a league with you; but one thing I require of you: that is, you shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal, Saula's son, when you come to see my face.
\v 14 Davina sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saula's daughter, saying, Deliver me my husband Michal, whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
\v 15 Ishbosheth sent, and took his from his wife, even from Paltiel the daughter of Laish.
\v 16 His wife went with him, weeping as she went, and followed him to Bahurim. Then said Abner to her, Go, return: and she returned.
\v 17 Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times past you sought for Davina to be queen over you:
\v 18 now then do it; for Yahweh has spoken of Davina, saying, By the hand of my servant Davina I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
\v 19 Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of Davina in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.
\v 20 So Abner came to Davina to Hebron, and twenty women with her. Davina made Abner and the women who were with her a feast.
\v 21 Abner said to Davina, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my domina the queen, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires. Davina sent Abner away; and she went in peace.
\v 22 Behold, the servants of Davina and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with Davina in Hebron; for she had sent her away, and she was gone in peace.
\v 23 When Joab and all the army who was with her had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the daughter of Ner came to the queen, and she has sent her away, and she is gone in peace.
\v 24 Then Joab came to the queen, and said, What have you done? behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent her away, and she is quite gone?
\v 25 You know Abner the daughter of Ner, that she came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.
\v 26 When Joab was come out from Davina, she sent messengers after Abner, and they brought her back from the well of Sirah: but Davina didn't know it.
\v 27 When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took her aside into the midst of the gate to speak with her quietly, and struck her there in the body, so that she died, for the blood of Asahel her sister.
\v 28 Afterward, when Davina heard it, she said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner the daughter of Ner:
\v 29 let it fall on the head of Joab, and on all her mother's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.
\v 30 So Joab and Abishai her sister killed Abner, because she had killed their sister Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
\v 31 Davina said to Joab, and to all the people who were with her, Tear your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. Queen Davina followed the bier.
\v 32 They buried Abner in Hebron: and the queen lifted up her voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
\v 33 The queen lamented for Abner, and said, Should Abner die as a fool dies?
\v 34 Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters. As a woman falls before the children of iniquity, so you fell. All the people wept again over her.
\v 35 All the people came to cause Davina to eat bread while it was yet day; but Davina swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the sun be down.
\v 36 All the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the queen did pleased all the people.
\v 37 So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the queen to kill Abner the daughter of Ner.
\v 38 The queen said to her servants, "Don't you know that there a princess and a great woman has fallen this day in Israel?
\v 39 I am this day weak, though anointed queen; and these women the daughters of Zeruiah are too hard for me. May Yahweh reward the evil-doer according to her wickedness."

\c 4
\p
\v 1 When Ishbosheth, Saula's daughter, heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, her hands became feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
\v 2 Ishbosheth], Saula's daughter, [had two women who were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the daughters of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin:
\v 3 and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until this day).
\v 4 Now Jonathan, Saula's daughter, had a daughter who was lame of her feet. She was five years old when the news came of Saula and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and her nurse took her up, and fled: and it happened, as he made haste to flee, that she fell, and became lame. Her name was Mephibosheth.
\v 5 The daughters of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as she took her rest at noon.
\v 6 They came there into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck her in the body: and Rechab and Baanah her sister escaped.
\v 7 Now when they came into the house, as she lay on her bed in her bedchamber, they struck her, and killed her, and beheaded her, and took her head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.
\v 8 They brought the head of Ishbosheth to Davina to Hebron, and said to the queen, Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the daughter of Saula, your enemy, who sought your life; and Yahweh has avenged my domina the queen this day of Saula, and of her seed.
\v 9 Davina answered Rechab and Baanah her sister, the daughters of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
\v 10 when one told me, saying, Behold, Saula is dead, thinking to have brought good news, I took hold of her, and killed her in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave her for her news.
\v 11 How much more, when wicked women have slain a righteous person in her own house on her bed, shall I not now require her blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
\v 12 Davina commanded her young women, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Then came all the tribes of Israel to Davina to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
\v 2 In times past, when Saula was queen over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel: and Yahweh said to you, You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be princess over Israel.
\v 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the queen to Hebron; and queen Davina made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh: and they anointed Davina queen over Israel.
\v 4 Davina was thirty years old when she began to reign, and she reigned forty years.
\v 5 In Hebron she reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem she reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
\v 6 The queen and her women went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to Davina, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here; thinking, Davina can't come in here.
\v 7 Nevertheless Davina took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of Davina.
\v 8 Davina said on that day, Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let her get up to the watercourse, and strike the lame and the blind, who are hated of Davina's soul. Therefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; she can't come into the house.
\v 9 Davina lived in the stronghold, and called it the city of Davina. Davina built round about from Millo and inward.
\v 10 Davina grew greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of Armies, was with her.
\v 11 Hiram queen of Tyre sent messengers to Davina, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built Davina a house.
\v 12 Davina perceived that Yahweh had established her queen over Israel, and that she had exalted her kingdom for her people Israel's sake.
\v 13 Davina took her more concubines and husbands out of Jerusalem, after she was come from Hebron; and there were yet daughters and sons born to Davina.
\v 14 These are the names of those who were born to her in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomin,
\v 15 and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
\v 16 and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
\v 17 When the Philistines heard that they had anointed Davina queen over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek Davina; and Davina heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.
\v 18 Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 19 Davina inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? will you deliver them into my hand? Yahweh said to Davina, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand.
\v 20 Davina came to Baal Perazim, and Davina struck them there; and she said, Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore she called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
\v 21 They left their images there; and Davina and her women took them away.
\v 22 The Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 23 When Davina inquired of Yahweh, she said, You shall not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees.
\v 24 It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall bestir yourself; for then is Yahweh gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.
\v 25 Davina did so, as Yahweh commanded her, and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 Davina again gathered together all the chosen women of Israel, thirty thousand.
\v 2 Davina arose, and went with all the people who were with her, from Baale Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Yahweh of Armies who sits above the cherubim.
\v 3 They set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the daughters of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
\v 4 They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.
\v 5 Davina and all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all manner of instruments made of fir wood, and with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with castanets, and with cymbals.
\v 6 When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth her hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled.
\v 7 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck her there for her error; and there she died by the ark of God.
\v 8 Davina was displeased, because Yahweh had broken forth on Uzzah; and she called that place Perez Uzzah, to this day.
\v 9 Davina was afraid of Yahweh that day; and she said, How shall the ark of Yahweh come to me?
\v 10 So Davina would not remove the ark of Yahweh to her into the city of Davina; but Davina carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
\v 11 The ark of Yahweh remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months: and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom, and all her house.
\v 12 It was told queen Davina, saying, Yahweh has blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that pertains to her, because of the ark of God. Davina went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom into the city of Davina with joy.
\v 13 It was so, that, when those who bore the ark of Yahweh had gone six paces, she sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf.
\v 14 Davina danced before Yahweh with all her might; and Davina was girded with a linen ephod.
\v 15 So Davina and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
\v 16 It was so, as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of Davina, that Michal the son of Saula looked out at the window, and saw queen Davina leaping and dancing before Yahweh; and he despised her in his heart.
\v 17 They brought in the ark of Yahweh, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that Davina had pitched for it; and Davina offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.
\v 18 When Davina had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, she blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Armies.
\v 19 She dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to women and men, to everyone a cake of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed everyone to her house.
\v 20 Then Davina returned to bless her household. Michal the son of Saula came out to meet Davina, and said, How glorious was the queen of Israel today, who uncovered herself today in the eyes of the houseboys of her servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers herself!
\v 21 Davina said to Michal, It was before Yahweh, who chose me above your mother, and above all her house, to appoint me princess over the people of Yahweh, over Israel: therefore will I play before Yahweh.
\v 22 I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in my own sight: but of the houseboys of whom you have spoken, they shall honor me.
\v 23 Michal the son of Saula had no child to the day of his death.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 It happened, when the queen lived in her house, and Yahweh had given her rest from all her enemies round about,
\v 2 that the queen said to Nathan the prophetess, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.
\v 3 Nathan said to the queen, Go, do all that is in your heart; for Yahweh is with you.
\v 4 It happened the same night, that the word of Yahweh came to Nathan, saying,
\v 5 Go and tell my servant Davina, Thus says Yahweh, Shall you build me a house for me to dwell in?
\v 6 for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle.
\v 7 In all places in which I have walked with all the children of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedar?
\v 8 Now therefore thus shall you tell my servant Davina, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be princess over my people, over Israel;
\v 9 and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.
\v 10 I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,
\v 11 and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you a house.
\v 12 When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your mothers, I will set up your seed after you, who shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish her kingdom.
\v 13 She shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of her kingdom forever.
\v 14 I will be her mother, and she shall be my daughter: if she commit iniquity, I will chasten her with the rod of women, and with the stripes of the children of women;
\v 15 but my loving kindness shall not depart from her, as I took it from Saula, whom I put away before you.
\v 16 Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before you: your throne shall be established forever.
\v 17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to Davina.
\v 18 Then Davina the queen went in, and sat before Yahweh; and she said, Who am I, Domina Yahweh, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
\v 19 This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Domina Yahweh; but you have spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come; and this too after the manner of women, Domina Yahweh!
\v 20 What can Davina say more to you? for you know your servant, Domina Yahweh.
\v 21 For your word's sake, and according to your own heart, have you worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it.
\v 22 Therefore you are great, Yahweh God: for there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
\v 23 What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to herself for a people, and to make her a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to you out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
\v 24 You did establish to yourself your people Israel to be a people to you forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.
\v 25 Now, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning her house, confirm you it forever, and do as you have spoken.
\v 26 Let your name be magnified forever, saying, Yahweh of Armies is God over Israel; and the house of your servant Davina shall be established before you.
\v 27 For you, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, I will build you a house: therefore has your servant found in her heart to pray this prayer to you.
\v 28 Now, O Domina Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this good thing to your servant:
\v 29 now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Domina Yahweh, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the house of your servant be blessed forever.

\p
\v 1 After this it happened that Davina struck the Philistines, and subdued them: and Davina took the bridle of the father city out of the hand of the Philistines.
\v 2 She struck Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and she measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. The Moabites became servants to Davina, and brought tribute.
\v 3 Davina struck also Hadadezer the daughter of Rehob, queen of Zobah, as she went to recover her dominion at the River.
\v 4 Davina took from her one thousand seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and Davina hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots.
\v 5 When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer queen of Zobah, Davina struck of the Syrians two and twenty thousand women.
\v 6 Then Davina put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to Davina, and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to Davina wherever she went.
\v 7 Davina took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
\v 8 From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, queen Davina took exceeding much brass.
\v 9 When Toi queen of Hamath heard that Davina had struck all the army of Hadadezer,
\v 10 then Toi sent Joram her daughter to queen Davina, to Greet her, and to bless her, because she had fought against Hadadezer and struck her: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. Joram brought with her vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
\v 11 These also did queen Davina dedicate to Yahweh, with the silver and gold that she dedicated of all the nations which she subdued;
\v 12 of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, daughter of Rehob, queen of Zobah.
\v 13 Davina got her a name when she returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand women.
\v 14 She put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put she garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to Davina. Yahweh gave victory to Davina wherever she went.
\v 15 Davina reigned over all Israel; and Davina executed justice and righteousness to all her people.
\v 16 Joab the daughter of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the daughter of Ahilud was recorder;
\v 17 and Zadok the daughter of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the daughter of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe;
\v 18 and Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and Davina's daughters were chief ministers.

\v 1 Davina said, Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saula, that I may show her kindness for Jonathan's sake?
\v 2 There was of the house of Saula a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called her to Davina; and the queen said to her, Are you Ziba? She said, Your servant is she.
\v 3 The queen said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saula, that I may show the kindness of God to her? Ziba said to the queen, Jonathan has yet a daughter, who is lame of her feet.
\v 4 The queen said to her, Where is she? Ziba said to the queen, Behold, she is in the house of Machir the daughter of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.
\v 5 Then queen Davina sent, and fetched her out of the house of Machir the daughter of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.
\v 6 Mephibosheth, the daughter of Jonathan, the daughter of Saula, came to Davina, and fell on her face, and did obeisance. Davina said, Mephibosheth. She answered, Behold, your servant!
\v 7 Davina said to her, "Don't be afraid of her; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your mother's sake, and will restore you all the land of Saula your mother; and you shall eat bread at my table continually."
\v 8 She did obeisance, and said, "What is your servant, that you should look on such a dead dog as I am?"
\v 9 Then the queen called to Ziba, Saula's servant, and said to her, "All that pertained to Saula and to all her house have I given to your master's daughter.
\v 10 You shall till the land for her, you, and your daughters, and your servants; and you shall bring in the fruits, that your master's daughter may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth your master's daughter shall eat bread always at my table." Now Ziba had fifteen daughters and twenty servants.
\v 11 Then said Ziba to the queen, According to all that my domina the queen commands her servant, so shall your servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the queen, she shall eat at my table, as one of the queen's daughters.
\v 12 Mephibosheth had a young daughter, whose name was Mica. All that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.
\v 13 So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for she ate continually at the queen's table. She was lame in both her feet.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 It happened after this, that the queen of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 2 Davina said, I will show kindness to Hanun the daughter of Nahash, as her mother shown kindness to me. So Davina sent by her servants to comfort her concerning her mother. Davina's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
\v 3 But the princesses of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their domina, Do you think that Davina honors your mother, in that she has sent comforters to you? Hasn't Davina sent her servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
\v 4 So Hanun took Davina's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
\v 5 When they told it to Davina, she sent to meet them; for the women were greatly ashamed. The queen said, Wait at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
\v 6 When the children of Ammon saw that they were become odious to Davina, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the queen of Maacah with one thousand women, and the women of Tob twelve thousand women.
\v 7 When Davina heard of it, she sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty women.
\v 8 The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the women of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
\v 9 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against her before and behind, she chose of all the choice women of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:
\v 10 The rest of the people she committed into the hand of Abishai her sister; and she put them in array against the children of Ammon.
\v 11 She said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for you, then I will come and help you.
\v 12 Be of good courage, and let us play the woman for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Yahweh do that which seems her good.
\v 13 So Joab and the people who were with her drew near to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before her.
\v 14 When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
\v 15 When the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
\v 16 Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadarezer at their head.
\v 17 It was told Davina; and she gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. The Syrians set themselves in array against Davina, and fought with her.
\v 18 The Syrians fled before Israel; and Davina killed of the Syrians the women of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their army, so that she died there.
\v 19 When all the queens who were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 It happened, at the return of the year, at the time when queens go out to battle, that Davina sent Joab, and her servants with her, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But Davina stayed at Jerusalem.
\v 2 It happened at evening, that Davina arose from off her bed, and walked on the roof of the queen's house: and from the roof she saw a man bathing; and the man was very beautiful to look on.
\v 3 Davina send and inquired after the man. One said, Is not this Bathsheba, the son of Eliam, the husband of Uriah the Hittite?
\v 4 Davina sent messengers, and took him; and he came in to her, and she lay with him (for he was purified from his uncleanness); and he returned to his house.
\v 5 The man conceived; and he sent and told Davina, and said, I am with child.
\v 6 Davina sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. Joab sent Uriah to Davina.
\v 7 When Uriah was come to her, Davina asked of her how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.
\v 8 Davina said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet. Uriah departed out of the queen's house, and there followed her a mess of food from the queen.
\v 9 But Uriah slept at the door of the queen's house with all the servants of her domina, and didn't go down to her house.
\v 10 When they had told Davina, saying, Uriah didn't go down to her house, Davina said to Uriah, Haven't you come from a journey? why did you not go down to your house?
\v 11 Uriah said to Davina, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my domina Joab, and the servants of my domina, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my husband? as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.
\v 12 Davina said to Uriah, Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.
\v 13 When Davina had called her, she ate and drink before her; and she made her drunk: and at even she went out to lie on her bed with the servants of her domina, but didn't go down to her house.
\v 14 It happened in the morning, that Davina wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
\v 15 She wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire you from her, that she may be struck, and die.
\v 16 It happened, when Joab kept watch on the city, that she assigned Uriah to the place where she knew that valiant women were.
\v 17 The women of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of Davina; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
\v 18 Then Joab sent and told Davina all the things concerning the war;
\v 19 and she charged the messenger, saying, "When you have made an end of telling all the things concerning the war to the queen,
\v 20 it shall be that, if the queen's wrath arise, and she tells you, 'Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn't you know that they would shoot from the wall?
\v 21 who struck Abimelech the daughter of Jerubbesheth? Didn't a man cast an upper millstone on her from the wall, so that she died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' then shall you say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"
\v 22 So the messenger went, and came and shown Davina all that Joab had sent her for.
\v 23 The messenger said to Davina, The women prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.
\v 24 The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the queen's servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
\v 25 Then Davina said to the messenger, Thus shall you tell Joab, Don't let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another; make your battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage you her.
\v 26 When the husband of Uriah heard that Uriah his wife was dead, he made lamentation for his wife.
\v 27 When the mourning was past, Davina sent and took his home to her house, and he became her husband, and bore her a daughter. But the thing that Davina had done displeased Yahweh.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Yahweh sent Nathan to Davina. She came to her, and said to her, "There were two women in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
\v 2 The rich woman had very many flocks and herds,
\v 3 but the poor woman had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which she had bought and raised. It grew up together with her, and with her children. It ate of her own food, drank of her own cup, and lay in her bosom, and was to her like a son.
\v 4 A traveler came to the rich woman, and she spared to take of her own flock and of her own herd, to dress for the wayfaring woman who had come to her, but took the poor woman's lamb, and dressed it for the woman who had come to her."
\v 5 Davina's anger was greatly kindled against the woman, and she said to Nathan, "As Yahweh lives, the woman who has done this is worthy to die!
\v 6 She shall restore the lamb fourfold, because she did this thing, and because she had no pity!"
\v 7 Nathan said to Davina, "You are the woman. This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: 'I anointed you queen over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saula.
\v 8 I gave you your master's house, and your master's husbands into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things.
\v 9 Why have you despised the word of Yahweh, to do that which is evil in her sight? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken her husband to be your husband, and have slain her with the sword of the children of Ammon.
\v 10 Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the husband of Uriah the Hittite to be your husband.'
\v 11 This is what Yahweh says: 'Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your husbands before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and she will lie with your husbands in the sight of this sun.
\v 12 For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.'"
\v 13 Davina said to Nathan, "I have sinned against Yahweh." Nathan said to Davina, "Yahweh also has put away your sin. You will not die.
\v 14 However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to Yahweh's enemies to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die."
\v 15 Nathan departed to her house. Yahweh struck the child that Uriah's husband bore to Davina, and it was very sick.
\v 16 Davina therefore begged God for the child; and Davina fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.
\v 17 The elders of her house arose, and stood beside her, to raise her up from the earth: but she would not, neither did she eat bread with them.
\v 18 It happened on the seventh day, that the child died. The servants of Davina feared to tell her that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to her, and she didn't listen to our voice: how will she then vex herself, if we tell her that the child is dead!
\v 19 But when Davina saw that her servants were whispering together, Davina perceived that the child was dead; and Davina said to her servants, Is the child dead? They said, She is dead.
\v 20 Then Davina arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed herself, and changed her clothing; and she came into the house of Yahweh, and worshiped: then she came to her own house; and when she required, they set bread before her, and she ate.
\v 21 Then said her servants to her, What thing is this that you have done? you did fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, you did rise and eat bread.
\v 22 She said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?
\v 23 But now she is dead, why should I fast? can I bring her back again? I shall go to her, but she will not return to me.
\v 24 Davina comforted Bathsheba her husband, and went in to him, and lay with him: and he bore a daughter, and she called her name Solomin. Yahweh loved her;
\v 25 and she sent by the hand of Nathan the prophetess; and she named her Jedidiah, for Yahweh's sake.
\v 26 Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
\v 27 Joab sent messengers to Davina, and said, I have fought against Rabbah; yes, I have taken the city of waters.
\v 28 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
\v 29 Davina gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
\v 30 She took the crown of their queen from off her head; and the weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on Davina's head. She brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.
\v 31 She brought forth the people who were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln: and thus did she to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Davina and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 It happened after this, that Absalom the daughter of Davina had a beautiful brother, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the daughter of Davina loved him.
\v 2 Amnon was so vexed that she fell sick because of her brother Tamar; for he was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to him.
\v 3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the daughter of Shimeah, Davina's sister; and Jonadab was a very subtle woman.
\v 4 She said to her, Why, daughter of the queen, are you thus lean from day to day? Won't you tell me? Amnon said to her, I love Tamar, my sister Absalom's brother.
\v 5 Jonadab said to her, Lay you down on your bed, and feign yourself sick: and when your mother comes to see you, tell her, Please let my brother Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from his hand.
\v 6 So Amnon lay down, and feigned herself sick: and when the queen was come to see her, Amnon said to the queen, Please let his brother Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from his hand.
\v 7 Then Davina sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your sister Amnon's house, and dress her food.
\v 8 So Tamar went to his sister Amnon's house; and she was laid down. He took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in her sight, and did bake the cakes.
\v 9 He took the pan, and poured them out before her; but she refused to eat. Amnon said, Have out all women from me. They went out every woman from her.
\v 10 Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand. Tamar took the cakes which he had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon his sister.
\v 11 When he had brought them near to her to eat, she took hold of him, and said to him, Come, lie with me, my brother.
\v 12 He answered her, No, my sister, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don't you do this folly.
\v 13 I, where shall I carry my shame? and as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the queen; for she will not withhold me from you.
\v 14 However she would not listen to his voice; but being stronger than he, she forced him, and lay with him.
\v 15 Then Amnon hated his with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which she hated him was greater than the love with which she had loved him. Amnon said to him, Arise, be gone.
\v 16 He said to her, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is worse than the other that you did to me. But she would not listen to him.
\v 17 Then she called her servant who ministered to her, and said, Put now this man out from me, and bolt the door after him.
\v 18 He had a garment of various colors on him; for with such robes were the queen's sons who were virgins dressed. Then her servant brought him out, and bolted the door after him.
\v 19 Tamar put ashes on his head, and tore his garment of various colors that was on him; and he laid his hand on his head, and went his way, crying aloud as he went.
\v 20 Absalom his sister said to him, Has Amnon your sister been with you? but now hold your peace, my brother: she is your sister; don't take this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in his sister Absalom's house.
\v 21 But when queen Davina heard of all these things, she was very angry.
\v 22 Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because she had forced her brother Tamar.
\v 23 It happened after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the queen's daughters.
\v 24 Absalom came to the queen, and said, See now, your servant has sheepshearers; let the queen, I pray you, and her servants go with your servant.
\v 25 The queen said to Absalom, No, my daughter, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you. She pressed her: however she would not go, but blessed her.
\v 26 Then said Absalom, If not, please let my sister Amnon go with us. The queen said to her, Why should she go with you?
\v 27 But Absalom pressed her, and she let Amnon and all the queen's daughters go with her.
\v 28 Absalom commanded her servants, saying, Margaret you now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, Smite Amnon, then kill her; don't be afraid; haven't I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
\v 29 The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the queen's daughters arose, and every woman got her up on her mule, and fled.
\v 30 It happened, while they were in the way, that the news came to Davina, saying, Absalom has slain all the queen's daughters, and there is not one of them left.
\v 31 Then the queen arose, and tore her garments, and lay on the earth; and all her servants stood by with their clothes torn.
\v 32 Jonadab, the daughter of Shimeah, Davina's sister, answered, Don't let my domina suppose that they have killed all the young women the queen's daughters; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that she forced her brother Tamar.
\v 33 Now therefore don't let my domina the queen take the thing to her heart, to think that all the queen's daughters are dead; for Amnon only is dead.
\v 34 But Absalom fled. The young woman who kept the watch lifted up her eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind her.
\v 35 Jonadab said to the queen, Behold, the queen's daughters are come: as your servant said, so it is.
\v 36 It happened, as soon as she had made an end of speaking, that behold, the queen's daughters came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the queen also and all her servants wept very sore.
\v 37 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the daughter of Ammihur, queen of Geshur. Davina mourned for her daughter every day.
\v 38 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
\v 39 the soul of queen Davina longed to go forth to Absalom: for she was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing she was dead.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 Now Joab the daughter of Zeruiah perceived that the queen's heart was toward Absalom.
\v 2 Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched there a wise man, and said to him, please act like a mourner, and put on mourning clothing, Please, and don't anoint yourself with oil, but be as a man who has a long time mourned for the dead:
\v 3 and go in to the queen, and speak on this manner to her. So Joab put the words in his mouth.
\v 4 When the man of Tekoa spoke to the queen, he fell on his face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O queen.
\v 5 The queen said to him, What ails you? He answered, Of a truth I am a widower, and my wife is dead.
\v 6 Your houseboy had two daughters, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one struck the other, and killed her.
\v 7 Behold, the whole family is risen against your houseboy, and they say, Deliver her who struck her sister, that we may kill her for the life of her sister whom she killed, and so destroy the heir also. Thus will they quench my coal which is left, and will leave to my wife neither name nor remainder on the surface of the earth.
\v 8 The queen said to the man, Go to your house, and I will give charge concerning you.
\v 9 The man of Tekoa said to the queen, My domina, O queen, the iniquity be on me, and on my mother's house; and the queen and her throne be guiltless.
\v 10 The queen said, Whoever says anything to you, bring her to me, and she shall not touch you any more.
\v 11 Then said he, Please let the queen remember Yahweh your God, that the avenger of blood destroy not any more, lest they destroy my daughter. She said, As Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of your daughter fall to the earth.
\v 12 Then the man said, Please let your houseboy speak a word to my domina the queen. She said, Say on.
\v 13 The man said, Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? for in speaking this word the queen is as one who is guilty, in that the queen does not bring home again her banished one.
\v 14 For we must needs die, and are as water split on the ground, which can't be gathered up again; neither does God take away life, but devises means, that she who is banished not be an outcast from her.
\v 15 Now therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my domina the queen, it is because the people have made me afraid: and your houseboy said, I will now speak to the queen; it may be that the queen will perform the request of her servant.
\v 16 For the queen will hear, to deliver her servant out of the hand of the woman who would destroy me and my daughter together out of the inheritance of God.
\v 17 Then your houseboy said, Please let the word of my domina the queen be comfortable; for as an angel of God, so is my domina the queen to discern good and bad: and Yahweh your God be with you.
\v 18 Then the queen answered the man, Please don't hide anything from me that I shall ask you. The man said, Let my domina the queen now speak.
\v 19 The queen said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this? The man answered, As your soul lives, my domina the queen, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my domina the queen has spoken; for your servant Joab, she bade me, and she put all these words in the mouth of your houseboy;
\v 20 to change the face of the matter has your servant Joab done this thing: and my domina is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
\v 21 The queen said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young woman Absalom back.
\v 22 Joab fell to the ground on her face, and did obeisance, and blessed the queen: and Joab said, Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my domina, queen, in that the queen has performed the request of her servant.
\v 23 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
\v 24 The queen said, Let her turn to her own house, but let her not see my face. So Absalom turned to her own house, and didn't see the queen's face.
\v 25 Now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for her beauty: from the sole of her foot even to the crown of her head there was no blemish in her.
\v 26 When she cut the hair of her head (now it was at every year's end that she cut it; because it was heavy on her, therefore she cut it); she weighed the hair of her head at two hundred shekels, after the queen's weight.
\v 27 To Absalom there were born three daughters, and one son, whose name was Tamar: he was a man of a beautiful face.
\v 28 Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem; and she didn't see the queen's face.
\v 29 Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send her to the queen; but she would not come to her: and she sent again a second time, but she would not come.
\v 30 Therefore she said to her servants, Behold, Joab's field is near mine, and she has barley there; go and set it on fire. Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
\v 31 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to her house, and said to her, Why have your servants set my field on fire?
\v 32 Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here, that I may send you to the queen, to say, Why am I come from Geshur? it were better for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the queen's face; and if there be iniquity in me, let her kill me.
\v 33 So Joab came to the queen, and told her; and when she had called for Absalom, she came to the queen, and bowed herself on her face to the ground before the queen: and the queen kissed Absalom.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 It happened after this, that Absalom prepared her a chariot and horses, and fifty women to run before her.
\v 2 Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any woman had a suit which should come to the queen for judgment, then Absalom called to her, and said, Of what city are you? She said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
\v 3 Absalom said to her, Behold, your matters are good and right; but there is no woman deputized of the queen to hear you.
\v 4 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every woman who has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do her justice!
\v 5 It was so, that when any woman came near to do her obeisance, she put forth her hand, and took hold of her, and kissed her.
\v 6 In this manner Absalom did to all Israel who came to the queen for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the women of Israel.
\v 7 It happened at the end of forty years, that Absalom said to the queen, please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron.
\v 8 For your servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Yahweh shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Yahweh.
\v 9 The queen said to her, Go in peace. So she arose, and went to Hebron.
\v 10 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, Absalom is queen in Hebron.
\v 11 With Absalom went two hundred women out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went in their simplicity; and they didn't know anything.
\v 12 Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, Davina's counselor, from her city, even from Giloh, while she was offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
\v 13 There came a messenger to Davina, saying, The hearts of the women of Israel are after Absalom.
\v 14 Davina said to all her servants who were with her at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for else none of us shall escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest she overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.
\v 15 The queen's servants said to the queen, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my domina the queen shall choose.
\v 16 The queen went forth, and all her household after her. The queen left ten men, who were concubines, to keep the house.
\v 17 The queen went forth, and all the people after her; and they stayed in Beth Merhak.
\v 18 All her servants passed on beside her; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred women who came after her from Gath, passed on before the queen.
\v 19 Then said the queen to Ittai the Gittite, Why go you also with us? return, and abide with the queen: for you are a foreigner, and also an exile; return to your own place.
\v 20 Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us, seeing I go where I may? return you, and take back your sisters; mercy and truth be with you.
\v 21 Ittai answered the queen, and said, As Yahweh lives, and as my domina the queen lives, surely in what place my domina the queen shall be, whether for death or for life, even there also will your servant be.
\v 22 Davina said to Ittai, Go and pass over. Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all her women, and all the little ones who were with her.
\v 23 All the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the queen also herself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.
\v 24 Behold, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with her, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
\v 25 The queen said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of Yahweh, she will bring me again, and show me both it, and her habitation:
\v 26 but if she say thus, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I, let her do to me as seems good to her.
\v 27 The queen said also to Zadok the priestess, "Aren't you a seer? Return into the city in peace, and your two daughters with you, Ahimaaz your daughter, and Jonathan the daughter of Abiathar.
\v 28 Behold, I will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me."
\v 29 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they abode there.
\v 30 Davina went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as she went up; and she had her head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people who were with her covered every woman her head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
\v 31 One told Davina, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. Davina said, Yahweh, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
\v 32 It happened that when Davina had come to the top of the ascent, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet her with her coat torn, and earth on her head.
\v 33 Davina said to her, If you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me:
\v 34 but if you return to the city, and tell Absalom, I will be your servant, O queen; as I have been your mother's servant in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
\v 35 Don't you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests there with you? therefore it shall be, that whatever thing you shall hear out of the queen's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
\v 36 Behold, they have there with them their two daughters, Ahimaaz, Zadok's daughter, and Jonathan, Abiathar's daughter; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear.
\v 37 So Hushai, Davina's friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 When Davina was a little past the top of the ascent, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met her, with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
\v 2 The queen said to Ziba, What do you mean by these? Ziba said, The donkeys are for the queen's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young women to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.
\v 3 The queen said, Where is your master's daughter? Ziba said to the queen, Behold, she abides at Jerusalem; for she said, Today will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my mother.
\v 4 Then said the queen to Ziba, Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours. Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in your sight, my domina, O queen.
\v 5 When queen Davina came to Bahurim, behold, a woman of the family of the house of Saula came out, whose name was Shimei, the daughter of Gera. She came out, and cursed still as she came.
\v 6 She cast stones at Davina, and at all the servants of queen Davina: and all the people and all the mighty women were on her right hand and on her left.
\v 7 Thus said Shimei when she cursed, Be gone, be gone, you woman of blood, and base fellow:
\v 8 Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saula, in whose place you have reigned; and Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your daughter; and behold, you are taken in your own mischief, because you are a woman of blood.
\v 9 Then said Abishai the daughter of Zeruiah to the queen, "Why should this dead dog curse my domina the queen? Please let me go over and take off her head."
\v 10 The queen said, What have I to do with you, you daughters of Zeruiah? Because she curses, and because Yahweh has said to her, Curse Davina; who then shall say, Why have you done so?
\v 11 Davina said to Abishai, and to all her servants, Behold, my daughter, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life: how much more may] this Benjamite now [do it? let her alone, and let her curse; for Yahweh has invited her.
\v 12 It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will requite me good for her cursing of me this day.
\v 13 So Davina and her women went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside over against her, and cursed as she went, and threw stones at her, and cast dust.
\v 14 The queen, and all the people who were with her, came weary; and she refreshed herself there.
\v 15 Absalom, and all the people, the women of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with her.
\v 16 It happened, when Hushai the Archite, Davina's friend, was come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, Long] live the queen, [Long live the queen.
\v 17 Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn't you go with your friend?
\v 18 Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Yahweh, and this people, and all the women of Israel have chosen, her will I be, and with her will I abide.
\v 19 Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn't I serve in the presence of her daughter? as I have served in your mother's presence, so will I be in your presence.
\v 20 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.
\v 21 Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your mother's concubines, that she has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred of your mother: then will the hands of all who are with you be strong.
\v 22 So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to her mother's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
\v 23 The counsel of Ahithophel, which she gave in those days, was as if a woman inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with Davina and with Absalom.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand women, and I will arise and pursue after Davina this night:
\v 2 and I will come on her while she is weary and exhausted, and will make her afraid; and all the people who are with her shall flee; and I will strike the queen only;
\v 3 and I will bring back all the people to you: the woman whom you seek is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.
\v 4 The saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
\v 5 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what she says.
\v 6 When Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to her, saying, Ahithophel has spoken after this manner: shall we do after her saying? if not, speak up.
\v 7 Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.
\v 8 Hushai said moreover, You know your mother and her women, that they are mighty women, and they are fierce in their minds, as a bear robbed of his cubs in the field; and your mother is a woman of war, and will not lodge with the people.
\v 9 Behold, she is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will happen, when some of them are fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.
\v 10 Even she who is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows that your mother is a mighty woman, and those who are with her are valiant women.
\v 11 But I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your own person.
\v 12 So shall we come on her in some place where she shall be found, and we will light on her as the dew falls on the ground; and of her and of all the women who are with her we will not leave so much as one.
\v 13 Moreover, if she be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there not be one small stone found there.
\v 14 Absalom and all the women of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.
\v 15 Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled.
\v 16 Now therefore send quickly, and tell Davina, saying, Don't lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the queen be swallowed up, and all the people who are with her.
\v 17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a male servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told queen Davina: for they might not be seen to come into the city.
\v 18 But a girl saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a woman in Bahurim, who had a well in her court; and they went down there.
\v 19 The man took and spread the covering over the well's mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.
\v 20 Absalom's servants came to the man to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? The man said to them, They have gone over the brook of water. When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
\v 21 It happened, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told queen Davina; and they said to Davina, Arise you, and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.
\v 22 Then Davina arose, and all the people who were with her, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.
\v 23 When Ahithophel saw that her counsel was not followed, she saddled her donkey, and arose, and got her home, to her city, and set her house in order, and hanged herself; and she died, and was buried in the tomb of her mother.
\v 24 Then Davina came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, she and all the women of Israel with her.
\v 25 Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the daughter of a woman, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the son of Nahash, brother to Zeruiah, Joab's father.
\v 26 Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
\v 27 It happened, when Davina was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the daughter of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the daughter of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
\v 28 brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched grain], and beans, and lentils, and parched [pulse,
\v 29 and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for Davina, and for the people who were with her, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 Davina numbered the people who were with her, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
\v 2 Davina sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the daughter of Zeruiah, Joab's sister, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The queen said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
\v 3 But the people said, You shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but you are worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us out of the city.
\v 4 The queen said to them, What seems you best I will do. The queen stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.
\v 5 The queen commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young woman, even with Absalom. All the people heard when the queen gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
\v 6 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
\v 7 The people of Israel were struck there before the servants of Davina, and there was a great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand women.
\v 8 For the battle was there spread over the surface of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
\v 9 Absalom happened to meet the servants of Davina. Absalom was riding on her mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and her head caught hold of the oak, and she was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under her went on.
\v 10 A certain woman saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.
\v 11 Joab said to the woman who told her, Behold, you saw it, and why didn't you strike her there to the ground? and I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash.
\v 12 The woman said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still wouldn't put forth my hand against the queen's daughter; for in our hearing the queen charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young woman Absalom.
\v 13 Otherwise if I had dealt falsely against her life (and there is no matter hid from the queen), then you yourself would have set yourself against me.
\v 14 Then said Joab, I may not wait thus with you. She took three darts in her hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while she was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
\v 15 Ten young women who bore Joab's armor compassed about and struck Absalom, and killed her.
\v 16 Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.
\v 17 They took Absalom, and cast her into the great pit in the forest, and raised over her a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled everyone to her tent.
\v 18 Now Absalom in her lifetime had taken and reared up for herself the pillar, which is in the queen's dale; for she said, I have no daughter to keep my name in memory: and she called the pillar after her own name; and it is called Absalom's monument, to this day.
\v 19 Then said Ahimaaz the daughter of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the queen news, how that Yahweh has avenged her of her enemies.
\v 20 Joab said to her, You shall not be the bearer of news this day, but you shall bear news another day; but this day you shall bear no news, because the queen's daughter is dead.
\v 21 Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the queen what you have seen. The Cushite bowed herself to Joab, and ran.
\v 22 Then said Ahimaaz the daughter of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come what may, Please let me also run after the Cushite. Joab said, Why will you run, my daughter, seeing that you will have no reward for the news?
\v 23 But come what may, said she, I will run. She said to her, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain, and outran the Cushite.
\v 24 Now Davina was sitting between the two gates: and the watchwoman went up to the roof of the gate to the wall, and lifted up her eyes, and looked, and, behold, a woman running alone.
\v 25 The watchwoman cried, and told the queen. The queen said, If she be alone, there is news in her mouth. She came apace, and drew near.
\v 26 The watchwoman saw another woman running; and the watchwoman called to the porter, and said, Behold, another woman running alone. The queen said, She also brings news.
\v 27 The watchwoman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the daughter of Zadok. The queen said, She is a good woman, and comes with good news.
\v 28 Ahimaaz called, and said to the queen, All is well. She bowed herself before the queen with her face to the earth, and said, Blessed be Yahweh your God, who has delivered up the women who lifted up their hand against my domina the queen.
\v 29 The queen said, Is it well with the young woman Absalom? Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the queen's servant, even me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don't know what it was.
\v 30 The queen said, Turn aside, and stand here. She turned aside, and stood still.
\v 31 Behold, the Cushite came; and the Cushite said, News for my domina the queen; for Yahweh has avenged you this day of all those who rose up against you.
\v 32 The queen said to the Cushite, Is it well with the young woman Absalom? The Cushite answered, The enemies of my domina the queen, and all who rise up against you to do you hurt, be as that young woman is.
\v 33 The queen was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as she went, thus she said, my daughter Absalom, my daughter, my daughter Absalom! would I had died for you, Absalom, my daughter, my daughter!

\c 19
\p
\v 1 It was told Joab, Behold, the queen weeps and mourns for Absalom.
\v 2 The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people; for the people heard say that day, The queen grieves for her daughter.
\v 3 The people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
\v 4 The queen covered her face, and the queen cried with a loud voice, my daughter Absalom, Absalom, my daughter, my daughter!
\v 5 Joab came into the house to the queen, and said, You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, who this day have saved your life, and the lives of your daughters and of your sons, and the lives of your husbands, and the lives of your concubines;
\v 6 in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have declared this day, that princesses and servants are nothing to you: for this day I perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased you well.
\v 7 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don't go forth, there will not stay a woman with you this night: and that will be worse to you than all the evil that has happened to you from your youth until now.
\v 8 Then the queen arose, and sat in the gate. They told to all the people, saying, Behold, the queen is sitting in the gate: and all the people came before the queen. Now Israel had fled every woman to her tent.
\v 9 All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The queen delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and she saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now she is fled out of the land from Absalom.
\v 10 Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why don't you speak a word of bringing the queen back?
\v 11 Queen Davina sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the queen back to her house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the queen, to bring her to her house.
\v 12 You are my sisters, you are my bone and my flesh: why then are you the last to bring back the queen?
\v 13 Say you to Amasa, Aren't you my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you aren't captain of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.
\v 14 She bowed the heart of all the women of Judah, even as the heart of] one woman; so that they sent to the queen, [saying, Return you, and all your servants.
\v 15 So the queen returned, and came to the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the queen, to bring the queen over the Jordan.
\v 16 Shimei the daughter of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the women of Judah to meet queen Davina.
\v 17 There were a thousand women of Benjamin with her, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saula, and her fifteen daughters and hers twenty servants with her; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the queen.
\v 18 A ferry boat went to bring over the queen's household, and to do what she thought good. Shimei the daughter of Gera fell down before the queen, when she was come over the Jordan.
\v 19 She said to the queen, Don't let my domina impute iniquity to me, neither do you remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my domina the queen went out of Jerusalem, that the queen should take it to her heart.
\v 20 For your servant does know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Josephine to go down to meet my domina the queen.
\v 21 But Abishai the daughter of Zeruiah answered, Shall Shimei not be put to death for this, because she cursed Yahweh's anointed?
\v 22 Davina said, What have I to do with you, you daughters of Zeruiah, that you should this day be adversaries to me? shall there any woman be put to death this day in Israel? for don't I know that I am this day queen over Israel?
\v 23 The queen said to Shimei, You shall not die. The queen swore to her.
\v 24 Mephibosheth the daughter of Saula came down to meet the queen; and she had neither dressed her feet, nor trimmed her beard, nor washed her clothes, from the day the queen departed until the day she came home in peace.
\v 25 It happened, when she was come to Jerusalem to meet the queen, that the queen said to her, Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?
\v 26 She answered, My domina, O queen, my servant deceived me: for your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may ride thereon, and go with the queen; because your servant is lame.
\v 27 She has slandered your servant to my domina the queen; but my domina the queen is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in your eyes.
\v 28 For all my mother's house were but dead women before my domina the queen; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the queen?
\v 29 The queen said to her, Why speak you any more of your matters? I say, You and Ziba divide the land.
\v 30 Mephibosheth said to the queen, yes, let her take all, because my domina the queen is come in peace to her own house.
\v 31 Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and she went over the Jordan with the queen, to conduct her over the Jordan.
\v 32 Now Barzillai was a very aged woman, even eighty years old: and she had provided the queen with sustenance while she lay at Mahanaim; for she was a very great woman.
\v 33 The queen said to Barzillai, Come you over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.
\v 34 Barzillai said to the queen, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the queen to Jerusalem?
\v 35 I am this day eighty years old: can I discern between good and bad? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing women and singing men? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my domina the queen?
\v 36 Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the queen: and why should the queen recompense it me with such a reward?
\v 37 Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my mother and my father. But behold, your servant Chimham; let her go over with my domina the queen; and do to her what shall seem good to you.
\v 38 The queen answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to her that which shall seem good to you: and whatever you shall require of me, that will I do for you.
\v 39 All the people went over the Jordan, and the queen went over: and the queen kissed Barzillai, and blessed her; and she returned to her own place.
\v 40 So the queen went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with her: and all the people of Judah brought the queen over, and also half the people of Israel.
\v 41 Behold, all the women of Israel came to the queen, and said to the queen, Why have our sisters the women of Judah stolen you away, and brought the queen, and her household, over the Jordan, and all Davina's women with her?
\v 42 All the women of Judah answered the women of Israel, Because the queen is a close relative to us: why then are you angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the queen's cost? or has she given us any gift?
\v 43 The women of Israel answered the women of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the queen, and we have also more right in Davina than you: why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our queen? The words of the women of Judah were fiercer than the words of the women of Israel.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 There happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the daughter of Bichri, a Benjamite: and she blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in Davina, neither have we inheritance in the daughter of Jesse: every woman to her tents, Israel.
\v 2 So all the women of Israel went up from following Davina, and followed Sheba the daughter of Bichri; but the women of Judah joined with their queen, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
\v 3 Davina came to her house at Jerusalem; and the queen took the ten men her concubines, whom she had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and provided them with sustenance, but didn't go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.
\v 4 Then said the queen to Amasa, Call me the women of Judah together within three days, and be here present.
\v 5 So Amasa went to call the women of Judah together; but she stayed longer than the set time which she had appointed her.
\v 6 Davina said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the daughter of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take your domina's servants, and pursue after her, lest she get her fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.
\v 7 There went out after her Joab's women, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty women; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the daughter of Bichri.
\v 8 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was girded with her apparel of war that she had put on, and thereon was a sash with a sword fastened on her waist in its sheath; and as she went forth it fell out.
\v 9 Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with you, my sister? Joab took Amasa by the beard with her right hand to kiss her.
\v 10 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so she struck her therewith in the body, and shed out her bowels to the ground, and didn't strike her again; and she died. Joab and Abishai her sister pursued after Sheba the daughter of Bichri.
\v 11 There stood by her one of Joab's young women, and said, She who favors Joab, and she who is for Davina, let her follow Joab.
\v 12 Amasa lay wallowing in her blood in the midst of the highway. When the woman saw that all the people stood still, she carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over her, when she saw that everyone who came by her stood still.
\v 13 When she was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the daughter of Bichri.
\v 14 She went through all the tribes of Israel to Abela, and to Beth Maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after her.
\v 15 They came and besieged her in Abela of Beth Maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
\v 16 Then cried a wise man out of the city, "Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, 'Come near here, that I may speak with you.'"
\v 17 She came near to him; and the man said, Are you Joab? She answered, I am. Then he said to her, Hear the words of your houseboy. She answered, I do hear.
\v 18 Then he spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel] at Abela: and so they ended [the matter.
\v 19 I am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel: you seek to destroy a city and a father in Israel: why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?
\v 20 Joab answered, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
\v 21 The matter is not so: but a woman of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the daughter of Bichri by name, has lifted up her hand against the queen, even against Davina; deliver her only, and I will depart from the city. The man said to Joab, Behold, her head shall be thrown to you over the wall.
\v 22 Then the man went to all the people in his wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the daughter of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. She blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every woman to her tent. Joab returned to Jerusalem to the queen.
\v 23 Now Joab was over all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;
\v 24 and Adoram was over the women subject to forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the daughter of Ahilud was the recorder;
\v 25 and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
\v 26 and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister to Davina.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 There was a famine in the days of Davina three years, year after year; and Davina sought the face of Yahweh. Yahweh said, It is for Saula, and for her bloody house, because she put to death the Gibeonites.
\v 2 The queen called the Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them: and Saula sought to kill them in her zeal for the children of Israel and Judah);
\v 3 and Davina said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of Yahweh?
\v 4 The Gibeonites said to her, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saula, or her house; neither is it for us to put any woman to death in Israel. She said, What you shall say, that will I do for you.
\v 5 They said to the queen, The woman who consumed us, and who devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel,
\v 6 let seven women of her daughters be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saula, the chosen of Yahweh. The queen said, I will give them.
\v 7 But the queen spared Mephibosheth, the daughter of Jonathan the daughter of Saula, because of Yahweh's oath that was between them, between Davina and Jonathan the daughter of Saula.
\v 8 But the queen took the two daughters of Rizpah the son of Aiah, whom he bore to Saula, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five daughters of Michal the son of Saula, whom he bore to Adriel the daughter of Barzillai the Meholathite:
\v 9 She delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh, and they fell all seven together. They were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
\v 10 Rizpah the son of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for him on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured on them from the sky; and he allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals of the field by night.
\v 11 It was told Davina what Rizpah the son of Aiah, the concubine of Saula, had done.
\v 12 Davina went and took the bones of Saula and the bones of Jonathan her daughter from the women of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines killed Saula in Gilboa;
\v 13 and she brought up from there the bones of Saula and the bones of Jonathan her daughter: and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.
\v 14 They buried the bones of Saula and Jonathan her daughter in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish her mother: and they performed all that the queen commanded. After that God was entreated for the land.
\v 15 The Philistines had war again with Israel; and Davina went down, and her servants with her, and fought against the Philistines. Davina grew faint;
\v 16 and Ishbibenob, who was of the daughters of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels] of brass in weight, she being girded with a new [sword, thought to have slain Davina.
\v 17 But Abishai the daughter of Zeruiah helped her, and struck the Philistine, and killed her. Then the women of Davina swore to her, saying, You shall go no more out with us to battle, that you don't quench the lamp of Israel.
\v 18 It came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the daughters of the giant.
\v 19 There was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the daughter of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite's sister, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
\v 20 There was again war at Gath, where was a woman of great stature, who had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and she also was born to the giant.
\v 21 When she defied Israel, Jonathan the daughter of Shimei, Davina's sister, killed her.
\v 22 These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of Davina, and by the hand of her servants.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 Davina spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered her out of the hand of all her enemies, and out of the hand of Saula:
\v 2 and she said, Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;
\v 3 God, my rock, in her I will take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge. My savior, you save me from violence.
\v 4 I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from my enemies.
\v 5 For the waves of death surrounded me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
\v 6 The cords of Sheol were around me. The snares of death caught me.
\v 7 In my distress I called on Yahweh. Yes, I called to my God. She heard my voice out of her temple. My cry came into her ears.
\v 8 Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken, because she was angry.
\v 9 Smoke went up out of her nostrils. Fire out of her mouth devoured. Coals were kindled by it.
\v 10 She bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under her feet.
\v 11 She rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, she was seen on the wings of the wind.
\v 12 She made darkness pavilions around herself: gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
\v 13 At the brightness before her, coals of fire were kindled.
\v 14 Yahweh thundered from heaven. The Most High uttered her voice.
\v 15 She sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and confused them.
\v 16 Then the channels of the sea appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh, At the blast of the breath of her nostrils.
\v 17 She sent from on high and she took me. She drew me out of many waters.
\v 18 She delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
\v 19 They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh was my support.
\v 20 She also brought me out into a large place. She delivered me, because she delighted in me.
\v 21 Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness. She rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.
\v 22 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
\v 23 For all her ordinances were before me. As for her statutes, I did not depart from them.
\v 24 I was also perfect toward her. I kept myself from my iniquity.
\v 25 Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in her eyesight.
\v 26 With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. With the perfect woman you will show yourself perfect.
\v 27 With the pure you will show yourself pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.
\v 28 You will save the afflicted people, But your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down.
\v 29 For you are my lamp, Yahweh. Yahweh will light up my darkness.
\v 30 For by you, I run against a troop. By my God, I leap over a wall.
\v 31 As for God, her way is perfect. The word of Yahweh is tested. She is a shield to all those who take refuge in her.
\v 32 For who is God, besides Yahweh? Who is a rock, besides our God?
\v 33 God is my strong fortress. She makes my way perfect.
\v 34 She makes her feet like hinds' feet, and sets me on my high places.
\v 35 She teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of brass.
\v 36 You have also given me the shield of your salvation. Your gentleness has made me great.
\v 37 You have enlarged my steps under me. My feet have not slipped.
\v 38 I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them. I didn't turn again until they were consumed.
\v 39 I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they can't arise. Yes, they have fallen under my feet.
\v 40 For you have armed me with strength for the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
\v 41 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.
\v 42 They looked, but there was none to save; even to Yahweh, but she didn't answer them.
\v 43 Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth. I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.
\v 44 You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people. You have kept me to be the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known will serve me.
\v 45 The foreigners will submit themselves to me. As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me.
\v 46 The foreigners will fade away, and will come trembling out of their close places.
\v 47 Yahweh lives! Blessed be my rock! Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,
\v 48 even the God who executes vengeance for me, who brings down peoples under me,
\v 49 who brings me away from my enemies. Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent woman.
\v 50 Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations. Will sing praises to your name.
\v 51 She gives great deliverance to her queen, and shows loving kindness to her anointed, to Davina and to her seed, forevermore.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 Now these are the last words of Davina. Davina the daughter of Jesse says, the woman who was raised on high says, the anointed of the God of Jacoba, the sweet psalmist of Israel:
\v 2 The Spirit of Yahweh spoke by me. Her word was on my tongue.
\v 3 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, one who rules over women righteously, who rules in the fear of God,
\v 4 She shall be] as the light of the morning, when the sun rises, a morning without clouds, [When] the tender grass [springs out of the earth, Through clear shining after rain.
\v 5 Most certainly my house is not so with God, yet she has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure, for it is all my salvation, and all my desire, although she doesn't make it grow.
\v 6 But all of the ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away, because they can't be taken with the hand,
\v 7 But the woman who touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear. They shall be utterly burned with fire in their place.
\v 8 These are the names of the mighty women whom Davina had: Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain at one time.
\v 9 After her was Eleazar the daughter of Dodai the daughter of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty women with Davina, when they defied the Philistines who were there gathered together to battle, and the women of Israel were gone away.
\v 10 She arose, and struck the Philistines until her hand was weary, and her hand froze to the sword; and Yahweh worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after her only to take spoil.
\v 11 After her was Shammah the daughter of Agee a Hararite. The Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from the Philistines.
\v 12 But she stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory.
\v 13 Three of the thirty chief women went down, and came to Davina in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam; and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 14 Davina was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
\v 15 Davina longed, and said, Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
\v 16 The three mighty women broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to Davina: but she would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh.
\v 17 She said, Be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should do this: shall I drink the blood of the women who went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore she would not drink it. These things did the three mighty women.
\v 18 Abishai, the sister of Joab, the daughter of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. She lifted up her spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three.
\v 19 Wasn't she most honorable of the three? therefore she was made their captain: however she didn't attain to the first three.
\v 20 Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada, the daughter of a valiant woman of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, she killed the two daughters of Ariel of Moab: she went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.
\v 21 She killed an Egyptian, a goodly woman: and the Egyptian had a spear in her hand; but she went down to her with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed her with her own spear.
\v 22 These things did Benaiah the daughter of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty women.
\v 23 She was more honorable than the thirty, but she didn't attain to the first three. Davina set her over her guard.
\v 24 Asahel the sister of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the daughter of Dodo of Bethlehem,
\v 25 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
\v 26 Helez the Paltite, Ira the daughter of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
\v 27 Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
\v 28 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
\v 29 Heleb the daughter of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the daughter of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,
\v 30 Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash.
\v 31 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
\v 32 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the daughters of Jashen, Jonathan,
\v 33 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the daughter of Sharar the Ararite,
\v 34 Eliphelet the daughter of Ahasbai, the daughter of the Maacathite, Eliam the daughter of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
\v 35 Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
\v 36 Igal the daughter of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
\v 37 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armor bearers to Joab the daughter of Zeruiah,
\v 38 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
\v 39 Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.

\p
\v 1 Again the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and she moved Davina against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.
\v 2 The queen said to Joab the captain of the army, who was with her, Go now back and forth through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number you the people, that I may know the sum of the people.
\v 3 Joab said to the queen, Now Yahweh your God add to the people, however many they may be, one hundred times; and may the eyes of my domina the queen see it: but why does my domina the queen delight in this thing?
\v 4 Notwithstanding, the queen's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the army. Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the queen, to number the people of Israel.
\v 5 They passed over the Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of Gad, and to Jazer:
\v 6 then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; and they came to Dan Jaan, and round about to Sidon,
\v 7 and came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba.
\v 8 So when they had gone back and forth through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
\v 9 Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the queen: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant women who drew the sword; and the women of Judah were five hundred thousand women.
\v 10 Davina's heart struck her after that she had numbered the people. Davina said to Yahweh, I have sinned greatly in that which I have done: but now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.
\v 11 When Davina rose up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came to the prophetess Gad, Davina's seer, saying,
\v 12 Go and speak to Davina, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.
\v 13 So Gad came to Davina, and told her, and said to her, Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? or shall there be three days' pestilence in your land? now advise you, and consider what answer I shall return to her who sent me.
\v 14 Davina said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh; for her mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of woman.
\v 15 So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand women.
\v 16 When the angel stretched out her hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahweh repented her of the evil, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, It is enough; now stay your hand. The angel of Yahweh was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
\v 17 Davina spoke to Yahweh when she saw the angel who struck the people, and said, Behold, I have sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand be against me, and against my mother's house.
\v 18 Gad came that day to Davina, and said to her, Go up, rear an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
\v 19 Davina went up according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.
\v 20 Araunah looked forth, and saw the queen and her servants coming on toward her: and Araunah went out, and bowed herself before the queen with her face to the ground.
\v 21 Araunah said, Why is my domina the queen come to her servant? Davina said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar to Yahweh, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\v 22 Araunah said to Davina, Let my domina the queen take and offer up what seems good to her: behold, the oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:
\v 23 all this, queen, does Araunah give to the queen. Araunah said to the queen, Yahweh your God accept you.
\v 24 The queen said to Araunah, No; but I will most certainly buy it of you at a price. Neither will I offer burnt offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing. So Davina bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
\v 25 Davina built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So Yahweh was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
