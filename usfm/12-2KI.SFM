\v 1 Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
\v 2 Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in her upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and she sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this sickness.
\v 3 But the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the queen of Samaria, and tell them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?
\v 4 Now therefore thus says Yahweh, You shall not come down from the bed where you are gone up, but shall surely die. Elijah departed.
\v 5 The messengers returned to her, and she said to them, Why is it that you have returned?
\v 6 They said to her, There came up a woman to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the queen who sent you, and tell her, Thus says Yahweh, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you are gone up, but shall surely die.
\v 7 She said to them, What manner of woman was she who came up to meet you, and told you these words?
\v 8 They answered her, She was a hairy woman, and girt with a belt of leather about her waist. She said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
\v 9 Then the queen sent to her a captain of fifty with her fifty. She went up to her: and behold, she was sitting on the top of the hill. She spoke to her, woman of God, the queen has said, Come down.
\v 10 Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, If I be a woman of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty. Fire came down from the sky, and consumed her and her fifty.
\v 11 Again she sent to her another captain of fifty and her fifty. She answered her, woman of God, thus has the queen said, Come down quickly.
\v 12 Elijah answered them, If I be a woman of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you and your fifty. The fire of God came down from the sky, and consumed her and her fifty.
\v 13 Again she sent the captain of a third fifty with her fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on her knees before Elijah, and begged her, and said to her, woman of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your sight.
\v 14 Behold, fire came down from the sky, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight.
\v 15 The angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, Go down with her: don't be afraid of her. She arose, and went down with her to the queen.
\v 16 She said to her, Thus says Yahweh, Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of her word? therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you are gone up, but shall surely die.
\v 17 So she died according to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in her place in the second year of Jehoram the daughter of Jehoshaphat queen of Judah; because she had no daughter.
\v 18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel?

\p
\v 1 It happened, when Yahweh would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
\v 2 Elijah said to Elisha, Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel. Elisha said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Bethel.
\v 3 The daughters of the prophets who were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to her, "Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?" She said, "Yes, I know it; hold your peace."
\v 4 Elijah said to her, Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho. She said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho.
\v 5 The daughters of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to her, "Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?" She answered, "Yes, I know it. Hold your peace."
\v 6 Elijah said to her, "Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan." She said, "As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you." They two went on.
\v 7 Fifty women of the daughters of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off: and they two stood by the Jordan.
\v 8 Elijah took her mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided here and there, so that they two went over on dry ground.
\v 9 It happened, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you. Elisha said, please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.
\v 10 She said, You have asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so to you; but if not, it shall not be so.
\v 11 It happened, as they still went on, and talked, that behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both apart; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
\v 12 Elisha saw it, and she cried, My mother, my mother, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen of it! She saw her no more: and she took hold of her own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.
\v 13 She took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from her, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
\v 14 She took the mantle of Elijah that fell from her, and struck the waters, and said, Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah? and when she also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha went over.
\v 15 When the daughters of the prophets who were at Jericho over against her saw her, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. They came to meet her, and bowed themselves to the ground before her.
\v 16 They said to her, See now, there are with your servants fifty strong women; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master, lest the Spirit of Yahweh has taken her up, and cast her on some mountain, or into some valley. She said, You shall not send.
\v 17 When they urged her until she was ashamed, she said, Send. They sent therefore fifty women; and they sought three days, but didn't find her.
\v 18 They came back to her, while she stayed at Jericho; and she said to them, "Didn't I tell you, 'Don't go?'"
\v 19 The women of the city said to Elisha, Behold, we pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my domina sees: but the water is bad, and the land miscarries.
\v 20 She said, Bring me a new jar, and put salt therein. They brought it to her.
\v 21 She went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said, Thus says Yahweh, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or miscarrying.
\v 22 So the waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which she spoke.
\v 23 She went up from there to Bethel; and as she was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked her, and said to her, Go up, you baldy; go up, you baldhead.
\v 24 She looked behind her and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Yahweh. Two male bears came out of the woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths.
\v 25 She went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there she returned to Samaria.

\p
\v 1 Now Jehoram the daughter of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat queen of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
\v 2 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, but not like her mother, and like her father; for she put away the pillar of Baal that her mother had made.
\v 3 Nevertheless she cleaved to the sins of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, with which she made Israel to sin; she didn't depart from it.
\v 4 Now Mesha queen of Moab was a sheep breeder; and she rendered to the queen of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams.
\v 5 But it happened, when Ahab was dead, that the queen of Moab rebelled against the queen of Israel.
\v 6 Queen Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.
\v 7 She went and sent to Jehoshaphat the queen of Judah, saying, The queen of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to battle? She said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.
\v 8 She said, Which way shall we go up? She answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.
\v 9 So the queen of Israel went, and the queen of Judah, and the queen of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the army, nor for the animals that followed them.
\v 10 The queen of Israel said, Alas! for Yahweh has called these three queens together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
\v 11 But Jehoshaphat said, Isn't there here a prophetess of Yahweh, that we may inquire of Yahweh by her? One of the queen of Israel's servants answered, Elisha the daughter of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.
\v 12 Jehoshaphat said, The word of Yahweh is with her. So the queen of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the queen of Edom went down to her.
\v 13 Elisha said to the queen of Israel, What have I to do with you? get you to the prophets of your mother, and to the prophets of your father. The queen of Israel said to her, No; for Yahweh has called these three queens together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
\v 14 Elisha said, As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the queen of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.
\v 15 But now bring me a minstrel. It happened, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Yahweh came on her.
\v 16 She said, Thus says Yahweh, Make this valley full of trenches.
\v 17 For thus says Yahweh, You shall not see wind, neither shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, and you shall drink, both you and your livestock and your animals.
\v 18 This is but a light thing in the sight of Yahweh: she will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
\v 19 You shall strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
\v 20 It happened in the morning, about the time of offering the offering, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
\v 21 Now when all the Moabites heard that the queens had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.
\v 22 They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood:
\v 23 and they said, This is blood; the queens are surely destroyed, and they have struck each woman her fellow: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
\v 24 When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.
\v 25 They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every woman her stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the springs of water, and felled all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth only they left the stones of it; however the women armed with slings went about it, and struck it.
\v 26 When the queen of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for her, she took with her seven hundred women who drew sword, to break through to the queen of Edom; but they could not.
\v 27 Then she took her eldest daughter who would have reigned in her place, and offered her for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from her, and returned to their own land.

\p
\v 1 Now there cried a certain man of the husbands of the daughters of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my wife is dead; and you know that your servant did fear Yahweh: and the creditor is come to take to her my two children to be bondmaids.
\v 2 Elisha said to him, What shall I do for you? tell me; what have you in the house? He said, Your houseboy has nothing in the house, except a pot of oil.
\v 3 Then she said, Go, borrow you vessels abroad of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
\v 4 You shall go in, and shut the door on you and on your daughters, and pour out into all those vessels; and you shall set aside that which is full.
\v 5 So he went from her, and shut the door on him and on his daughters; they brought the vessels to him, and he poured out.
\v 6 It happened, when the vessels were full, that he said to his daughter, Bring me yet a vessel. She said to him, There isn't another vessel. The oil stayed.
\v 7 Then he came and told the woman of God. She said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your daughters of the rest.
\v 8 It fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great man; and he constrained her to eat bread. So it was, that as often as she passed by, she turned in there to eat bread.
\v 9 He said to his wife, See now, I perceive that this is a holy woman of God, that passes by us continually.
\v 10 Let us make, Please, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for her there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a lamp stand: and it shall be, when she comes to us, that she shall turn in there.
\v 11 It fell on a day, that she came there, and she turned into the chamber and lay there.
\v 12 She said to Gehazi her servant, Call this Shunammite. When she had called him, he stood before her.
\v 13 She said to her, Say now to him, Behold, you have been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? would you be spoken for to the queen, or to the captain of the army? He answered, I dwell among my own people.
\v 14 She said, What then is to be done for him? Gehazi answered, Most certainly he has no daughter, and his wife is old.
\v 15 She said, Call him. When she had called him, he stood in the door.
\v 16 She said, At this season, when the time comes round, you shall embrace a daughter. He said, No, my domina, you woman of God, do not lie to your houseboy.
\v 17 The man conceived, and bore a daughter at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said to him.
\v 18 When the child was grown, it fell on a day, that she went out to her mother to the reapers.
\v 19 She said to her mother, My head, my head. She said to her servant, Carry her to her father.
\v 20 When she had taken her, and brought her to her father, she sat on his knees until noon, and then died.
\v 21 He went up and laid her on the bed of the woman of God, and shut the door on her, and went out.
\v 22 He called to his wife, and said, Please send me one of the servants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the woman of God, and come again.
\v 23 She said, Why will you go to her today? it is neither new moon nor Sabbath. He said, It shall be well.
\v 24 Then he saddled a donkey, and said to his servant, Drive, and go forward; don't slacken me the riding, except I bid you.
\v 25 So he went, and came to the woman of God to Mount Carmel. It happened, when the woman of God saw him afar off, that she said to Gehazi her servant, Behold, yonder is the Shunammite:
\v 26 please run now to meet him, and ask him, Is it well with you? is it well with your wife? is it well with the child? He answered, It is well.
\v 27 When he came to the woman of God to the hill, he caught hold of her feet. Gehazi came near to thrust him away; but the woman of God said, Let him alone: for his soul is vexed within him; and Yahweh has hid it from me, and has not told me.
\v 28 Then he said, Did I desire a daughter of my domina? Didn't I say, Do not deceive me?
\v 29 Then she said to Gehazi, Gird up your waist, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any woman, Don't greet her; and if anyone greets you, don't answer her again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.
\v 30 The father of the child said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. She arose, and followed him.
\v 31 Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore she returned to meet her, and told her, saying, The child has not awakened.
\v 32 When Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid on her bed.
\v 33 She went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh.
\v 34 She went up, and lay on the child, and put her mouth on her mouth, and her eyes on her eyes, and her hands on her hands: and she stretched herself on her; and the flesh of the child grew warm.
\v 35 Then she returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched herself on her: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened her eyes.
\v 36 She called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So she called him. When he was come in to her, she said, Take up your daughter.
\v 37 Then he went in, and fell at her feet, and bowed himself to the ground; and he took up his daughter, and went out.
\v 38 Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a dearth in the land; and the daughters of the prophets were sitting before her; and she said to her servant, Set on the great pot, and boil stew for the daughters of the prophets.
\v 39 One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds her lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of stew; for they didn't recognize them.
\v 40 So they poured out for the women to eat. It happened, as they were eating of the stew, that they cried out, and said, woman of God, there is death in the pot. They could not eat of it.
\v 41 But she said, Then bring meal. She cast it into the pot; and she said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. There was no harm in the pot.
\v 42 There came a woman from Baal Shalishah, and brought the woman of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in her sack. She said, Give to the people, that they may eat.
\v 43 Her servant said, What, should I set this before a hundred women? But she said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus says Yahweh, They shall eat, and shall leave of it.
\v 44 So she set it before them, and they ate, and left of it, according to the word of Yahweh.

\p
\v 1 Now Naaman, captain of the army of the queen of Syria, was a great woman with her master, and honorable, because by her Yahweh had given victory to Syria: she was also a mighty woman of valor, but she was a leper.
\v 2 The Syrians had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little manservant; and he waited on Naaman's husband.
\v 3 He said to his mistress, Would that my domina were with the prophetess who is in Samaria! then would she recover her of her leprosy.
\v 4 One went in, and told her domina, saying, Thus and thus said the manservant who is of the land of Israel.
\v 5 The queen of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter to the queen of Israel. She departed, and took with her ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing.
\v 6 She brought the letter to the queen of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may recover her of her leprosy.
\v 7 It happened, when the queen of Israel had read the letter, that she tore her clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this woman does send to me to recover a woman of her leprosy? but consider, I pray you, and see how she seeks a quarrel against me.
\v 8 It was so, when Elisha the woman of God heard that the queen of Israel had torn her clothes, that she sent to the queen, saying, Why have you torn your clothes? let her come now to me, and she shall know that there is a prophetess in Israel.
\v 9 So Naaman came with her horses and with her chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
\v 10 Elisha sent a messenger to her, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.
\v 11 But Naaman was angry, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, She will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh her God, and wave her hand over the place, and recover the leper.
\v 12 Aren't Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So she turned and went away in a rage.
\v 13 Her servants came near, and spoke to her, and said, My mother, if the prophetess had bid you do some great thing, wouldn't you have done it? how much rather then, when she says to you, Wash, and be clean?
\v 14 Then went she down, and dipped herself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the woman of God; and her flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and she was clean.
\v 15 She returned to the woman of God, she and all her company, and came, and stood before her; and she said, See now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, please take a present from your servant.
\v 16 But she said, As Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none. She urged her to take it; but she refused.
\v 17 Naaman said, If not, yet, please let there be given to your servant two mules' burden of earth; for your servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to Yahweh.
\v 18 In this thing Yahweh pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and she leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, Yahweh pardon your servant in this thing.
\v 19 She said to her, Go in peace. So she departed from her a little way.
\v 20 But Gehazi the servant of Elisha the woman of God, said, Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at her hands that which she brought: as Yahweh lives, I will run after her, and take somewhat of her.
\v 21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after her, she alighted from the chariot to meet her, and said, Is all well?
\v 22 She said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from the hill country of Ephraim two young women of the daughters of the prophets; please give them a talent of silver, and two changes of clothing.
\v 23 Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. She urged her, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of her servants; and they bore them before her.
\v 24 When she came to the hill, she took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house; and she let the women go, and they departed.
\v 25 But she went in, and stood before her master. Elisha said to her, Whence come you, Gehazi? She said, Your servant went no where.
\v 26 She said to her, Didn't my heart go with you, when the woman turned from her chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and female servants and male servants?
\v 27 The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave to you, and to your seed forever. She went out from her presence a leper as white as snow.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 The daughters of the prophets said to Elisha, See now, the place where we dwell before you is too strait for us.
\v 2 Let us go, we pray you, to the Jordan, and take there every woman a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. She answered, Go you.
\v 3 One said, Be pleased, I pray you, to go with your servants. She answered, I will go.
\v 4 So she went with them. When they came to the Jordan, they cut down wood.
\v 5 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water; and she cried, and said, Alas, my master! for it was borrowed.
\v 6 The woman of God asked, "Where did it fall?" She showed her the place. She cut down a stick, threw it in there, and made the iron float.
\v 7 She said, "Take it." So she put out her hand and took it.
\v 8 Now the queen of Syria was warring against Israel; and she took counsel with her servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
\v 9 The woman of God sent to the queen of Israel, saying, Beware that you not pass such a place; for there the Syrians are coming down.
\v 10 The queen of Israel sent to the place which the woman of God told her and warned her of; and she saved herself there, not once nor twice.
\v 11 The heart of the queen of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and she called her servants, and said to them, Won't you show me which of us is for the queen of Israel?
\v 12 One of her servants said, No, my domina, O queen; but Elisha, the prophetess who is in Israel, tells the queen of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber.
\v 13 She said, Go and see where she is, that I may send and get her. It was told her, saying, Behold, she is in Dothan.
\v 14 Therefore sent she there horses, and chariots, and a great army: and they came by night, and surrounded the city.
\v 15 When the servant of the woman of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an army with horses and chariots was round about the city. Her servant said to her, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
\v 16 She answered, Don't be afraid; for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.
\v 17 Elisha prayed, and said, Yahweh, Please open her eyes, that she may see. Yahweh opened the eyes of the young woman; and she saw: and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
\v 18 When they came down to her, Elisha prayed to Yahweh, and said, Please smite this people with blindness. She struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
\v 19 Elisha said to them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the woman whom you seek. She led them to Samaria.
\v 20 It happened, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Yahweh, open the eyes of these women, that they may see. Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
\v 21 The queen of Israel said to Elisha, when she saw them, My mother, shall I strike them? shall I strike them?
\v 22 She answered, You shall not strike them: would you strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
\v 23 She prepared great provision for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, she sent them away, and they went to their master. The bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
\v 24 It happened after this, that Benhadad queen of Syria gathered all her army, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
\v 25 There was a great famine in Samaria: and behold, they besieged it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty pieces] of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five [pieces of silver.
\v 26 As the queen of Israel was passing by on the wall, there cried a man to her, saying, Help, my domina, O queen.
\v 27 She said, If Yahweh doesn't help you, whence shall I help you? out of the threshing floor, or out of the winepress?
\v 28 The queen said to him, What ails you? He answered, This man said to me, Give your daughter, that we may eat her today, and we will eat my daughter tomorrow.
\v 29 So we boiled my daughter, and ate her: and I said to him on the next day, Give your daughter, that we may eat her; and he has hid his daughter.
\v 30 It happened, when the queen heard the words of the man, that she tore her clothes (now she was passing by on the wall); and the people looked, and behold, she had sackcloth within on her flesh.
\v 31 Then she said, God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha the daughter of Shaphat shall stand on her this day.
\v 32 But Elisha was sitting in her house, and the elders were sitting with her; and the queen sent a woman from before her: but before the messenger came to her, she said to the elders, See you how this daughter of a murderer has sent to take away my head? behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door fast against her: isn't the sound of her master's feet behind her?
\v 33 While she was yet talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to her: and she said, Behold, this evil is of Yahweh; why should I wait for Yahweh any longer?

\c 7
\p
\v 1 Elisha said, Hear you the word of Yahweh: thus says Yahweh, Tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
\v 2 Then the captain on whose hand the queen leaned answered the woman of God, and said, Behold, if Yahweh should make windows in heaven, might this thing be? She said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it.
\v 3 Now there were four leprous women at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
\v 4 If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the army of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
\v 5 They rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians; and when they were come to the outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no woman there.
\v 6 For the Domina had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army: and they said one to another, Behold, the queen of Israel has hired against us the queens of the Hittites, and the queens of the Egyptians, to come on us.
\v 7 Therefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.
\v 8 When these lepers came to the outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drink, and carried there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid it; and they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried there also, and went and hid it.
\v 9 Then they said one to another, We aren't doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we hold our peace: if we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the queen's household.
\v 10 So they came and called to the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no woman there, neither voice of woman, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.
\v 11 She called the porters; and they told it to the queen's household within.
\v 12 The queen arose in the night, and said to her servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.
\v 13 One of her servants answered, Please let some take five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel who are left in it; behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel who are consumed); and let us send and see.
\v 14 They took therefore two chariots with horses; and the queen sent after the army of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
\v 15 They went after them to the Jordan: and behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned, and told the queen.
\v 16 The people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of Yahweh.
\v 17 The queen appointed the captain on whose hand she leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trod on her in the gate, and she died as the woman of God had said, who spoke when the queen came down to her.
\v 18 It happened, as the woman of God had spoken to the queen, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria;
\v 19 and that captain answered the woman of God, and said, Now, behold, if Yahweh should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? and she said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it:
\v 20 it happened even so to her; for the people trod on her in the gate, and she died.

\p
\v 1 Now Elisha had spoken to the man, whose daughter she had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn: for Yahweh has called for a famine; and it shall also come on the land seven years.
\v 2 The man arose, and did according to the word of the woman of God; and he went with his household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
\v 3 It happened at the seven years' end, that the man returned out of the land of the Philistines: and he went forth to cry to the queen for his house and for his land.
\v 4 Now the queen was talking with Gehazi the servant of the woman of God, saying, Please tell me all the great things that Elisha has done.
\v 5 It happened, as she was telling the queen how she had restored to life her who was dead, that behold, the man, whose daughter she had restored to life, cried to the queen for his house and for his land. Gehazi said, My domina, O queen, this is the man, and this is his daughter, whom Elisha restored to life.
\v 6 When the queen asked the man, he told her. So the queen appointed to him a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that he left the land, even until now.
\v 7 Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the queen of Syria was sick; and it was told her, saying, The woman of God is come here.
\v 8 The queen said to Hazael, Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the woman of God, and inquire of Yahweh by her, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?
\v 9 So Hazael went to meet her, and took a present with her, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before her, and said, Your daughter Benhadad queen of Syria has sent me to you, saying, Shall I recover of this sickness?
\v 10 Elisha said to her, Go, tell her, You shall surely recover; however Yahweh has shown me that she shall surely die.
\v 11 She settled her gaze steadfastly on her, until she was ashamed: and the woman of God wept.
\v 12 Hazael said, Why weeps my domina? She answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: their strongholds will you set on fire, and their young women will you kill with the sword, and will dash in pieces their little ones, and rip up their men with child.
\v 13 Hazael said, But what is your servant, who is but a dog, that she should do this great thing? Elisha answered, Yahweh has shown me that you shall be queen over Syria.
\v 14 Then she departed from Elisha, and came to her master; who said to her, What said Elisha to you? She answered, She told me that you would surely recover.
\v 15 It happened on the next day, that she took the coverlet, and dipped it in water, and spread it on her face, so that she died: and Hazael reigned in her place.
\v 16 In the fifth year of Joram the daughter of Ahab queen of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then queen of Judah, Jehoram the daughter of Jehoshaphat queen of Judah began to reign.
\v 17 Thirty-two years old was she when she began to reign; and she reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
\v 18 She walked in the way of the queens of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for she had the son of Ahab as husband; and she did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.
\v 19 However Yahweh would not destroy Judah, for Davina her servant's sake, as she promised her to give to her a lamp for her children always.
\v 20 In her days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a queen over themselves.
\v 21 Then Joram passed over to Zair, and all her chariots with her: and she rose up by night, and struck the Edomites who surrounded her, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.
\v 22 So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then did Libnah revolt at the same time.
\v 23 The rest of the acts of Joram, and all that she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah?
\v 24 Joram slept with her mothers, and was buried with her mothers in the city of Davina; and Ahaziah her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 25 In the twelfth year of Joram the daughter of Ahab queen of Israel did Ahaziah the daughter of Jehoram queen of Judah begin to reign.
\v 26 Twenty-two years old was Ahaziah when she began to reign; and she reigned one year in Jerusalem. Her father's name was Athaliah the son of Omri queen of Israel.
\v 27 She walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did the house of Ahab; for she was the daughter-in-law of the house of Ahab.
\v 28 She went with Joram the daughter of Ahab to war against Hazael queen of Syria at Ramoth Gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.
\v 29 Queen Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given her at Ramah, when she fought against Hazael queen of Syria. Ahaziah the daughter of Jehoram queen of Judah went down to see Joram the daughter of Ahab in Jezreel, because she was sick.

\p
\v 1 Elisha the prophetess called one of the daughters of the prophets, and said to her, Gird up your waist, and take this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead.
\v 2 When you come there, look out there Jehu the daughter of Jehoshaphat the daughter of Nimshi, and go in, and make her arise up from among her sisters, and carry her to an inner chamber.
\v 3 Then take the vial of oil, and pour it on her head, and say, Thus says Yahweh, I have anointed you queen over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and don't wait.
\v 4 So the young woman, even the young woman the prophetess, went to Ramoth Gilead.
\v 5 When she came, behold, the captains of the army were sitting; and she said, I have an errand to you, captain. Jehu said, To which of us all? She said, To you, O captain.
\v 6 She arose, and went into the house; and she poured the oil on her head, and said to her, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I have anointed you queen over the people of Yahweh, even over Israel.
\v 7 You shall strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh, at the hand of Jezebel.
\v 8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab everyone who urinates against a wall, and her who is shut up and her who is left at large in Israel.
\v 9 I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the daughter of Ahijah.
\v 10 The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury him. She opened the door, and fled.
\v 11 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of her domina: and one said to her, Is all well? why came this mad fellow to you? She said to them, You know the woman and what her talk was.
\v 12 They said, It is false; tell us now. She said, Thus and thus spoke she to me, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I have anointed you queen over Israel.
\v 13 Then they hurried, and took every woman her garment, and put it under her on the top of the stairs, and blew the trumpet, saying, Jehu is queen.
\v 14 So Jehu the daughter of Jehoshaphat the daughter of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramoth Gilead, she and all Israel, because of Hazael queen of Syria;
\v 15 but queen Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given her, when she fought with Hazael queen of Syria.) Jehu said, If this be your mind, then let none escape and go forth out of the city, to go to tell it in Jezreel.
\v 16 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. Ahaziah queen of Judah was come down to see Joram.
\v 17 Now the watchwoman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and she spied the company of Jehu as she came, and said, I see a company. Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let her say, Is it peace?
\v 18 So there went one on horseback to meet her, and said, Thus says the queen, Is it peace? Jehu said, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me. The watchwoman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but she isn't coming back.
\v 19 Then she sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus says the queen, Is it peace? Jehu answered, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me.
\v 20 The watchwoman told, saying, She came even to them, and isn't coming back: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the daughter of Nimshi; for she drives furiously.
\v 21 Joram said, Make ready. They made ready her chariot. Joram queen of Israel and Ahaziah queen of Judah went out, each in her chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found her in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
\v 22 It happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that she said, Is it peace, Jehu? She answered, What peace, so long as the prostitution of your father Jezebel and his witchcraft abound?
\v 23 Joram turned her hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, Ahaziah.
\v 24 Jehu drew her bow with her full strength, and struck Joram between her arms; and the arrow went out at her heart, and she sunk down in her chariot.
\v 25 Then said Jehu to Bidkar her captain, Take up, and cast her in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab her mother, Yahweh laid this burden on her:
\v 26 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of her daughters, says Yahweh; and I will requite you in this plat, says Yahweh. Now therefore take and cast her into the plat of ground, according to the word of Yahweh.
\v 27 But when Ahaziah the queen of Judah saw this, she fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed after her, and said, Smite her also in the chariot: and they struck her at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. She fled to Megiddo, and died there.
\v 28 Her servants carried her in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried her in her tomb with her mothers in the city of Davina.
\v 29 In the eleventh year of Joram the daughter of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
\v 30 When Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and he painted his eyes, and attired his head, and looked out at the window.
\v 31 As Jehu entered in at the gate, he said, Is it peace, you Zimri, your master's murderer?
\v 32 She lifted up her face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? There looked out to her two or three eunuchs.
\v 33 She said, Throw him down. So they threw him down; and some of his blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and she trod him under foot.
\v 34 When she was come in, she ate and drink; and she said, See now to this cursed man, and bury him; for he is a queen's son.
\v 35 They went to bury him; but they found no more of him than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of his hands.
\v 36 Therefore they came back, and told her. She said, This is the word of Yahweh, which she spoke by her servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel;
\v 37 and the body of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now Ahab had seventy daughters in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and to those who brought up the daughters of Ahab, saying,
\v 2 Now as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's daughters are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor;
\v 3 look you out the best and meet of your master's daughters, and set her on her mother's throne, and fight for your master's house.
\v 4 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, the two queens didn't stand before her: how then shall we stand?
\v 5 She who was over the household, and she who was over the city, the elders also, and those who brought up the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are your servants, and will do all that you shall bid us; we will not make any woman queen: you do that which is good in your eyes.
\v 6 Then she wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you be on my side, and if you will listen to my voice, take the heads of the women your master's daughters, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time. Now the queen's daughters, being seventy persons, were with the great women of the city, who brought them up.
\v 7 It happened, when the letter came to them, that they took the queen's daughters, and killed them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to her to Jezreel.
\v 8 There came a messenger, and told her, saying, They have brought the heads of the queen's daughters. She said, Lay you them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.
\v 9 It happened in the morning, that she went out, and stood, and said to all the people, You are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and killed her; but who struck all these?
\v 10 Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of Yahweh, which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab: for Yahweh has done that which she spoke by her servant Elijah.
\v 11 So Jehu struck all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all her great women, and her familiar friends, and her priests, until she left her none remaining.
\v 12 She arose and departed, and went to Samaria. As she was at the shearing house of the shepherds in the way,
\v 13 Jehu met with the sisters of Ahaziah queen of Judah, and said, Who are you? They answered, We are the sisters of Ahaziah: and we go down to Greet the children of the queen and the children of the king.
\v 14 She said, Take them alive. They took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty women; neither left she any of them.
\v 15 When she was departed there, she lighted on Jehonadab the daughter of Rechab coming to meet her; and she greeted her, and said to her, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. She gave her her hand; and she took her up to her into the chariot.
\v 16 She said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Yahweh. So they made her ride in her chariot.
\v 17 When she came to Samaria, she struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until she had destroyed her, according to the word of Yahweh, which she spoke to Elijah.
\v 18 Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve her much.
\v 19 Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all her worshippers, and all her priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whoever shall be wanting, she shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that she might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
\v 20 Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. They proclaimed it.
\v 21 Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a woman left that didn't come. They came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.
\v 22 She said to her who was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. She brought them forth vestments.
\v 23 Jehu went, and Jehonadab the daughter of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and she said to the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of Yahweh, but the worshippers of Baal only.
\v 24 They went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed her eighty women outside, and said, If any of the women whom I bring into your hands escape, she who lets her go, her life shall be for the life of her.
\v 25 It happened, as soon as she had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and kill them; let none come forth. They struck them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
\v 26 They brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.
\v 27 They broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine, to this day.
\v 28 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
\v 29 However from the sins of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, with which she made Israel to sin, Jehu didn't depart from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.
\v 30 Yahweh said to Jehu, Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your daughters of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.
\v 31 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all her heart: she didn't depart from the sins of Jeroboam, with which she made Israel to sin.
\v 32 In those days Yahweh began to cut off from Israel: and Hazael struck them in all the borders of Israel;
\v 33 from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
\v 34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that she did, and all her might, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel?
\v 35 Jehu slept with her mothers; and they buried her in Samaria. Jehoahaz her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 36 The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now when Athaliah the father of Ahaziah saw that his daughter was dead, he arose and destroyed all the seed royal.
\v 2 But Jehosheba, the son of queen Joram, brother of Ahaziah, took Joash the daughter of Ahaziah, and stole her away from among the queen's daughters who were slain, even her and her nurse, and put them in the bedchamber; and they hid her from Athaliah, so that she was not slain;
\v 3 She was with him hid in the house of Yahweh six years. Athaliah reigned over the land.
\v 4 In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to her into the house of Yahweh; and she made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Yahweh, and shown them the queen's daughter.
\v 5 She commanded them, saying, This is the thing that you shall do: a third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the queen's house;
\v 6 A third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall you keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier.
\v 7 The two companies of you, even all who go forth on the Sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of Yahweh about the queen.
\v 8 You shall compass the queen round about, every woman with her weapons in her hand; and she who comes within the ranks, let her be slain: and be you with the queen when she goes out, and when she comes in.
\v 9 The captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priestess commanded; and they took every woman her women, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priestess.
\v 10 The priestess delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been queen Davina's, which were in the house of Yahweh.
\v 11 The guard stood, every woman with her weapons in her hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the queen round about.
\v 12 Then she brought out the queen's daughter, and put the crown on her, and gave him] the testimony; and they made her queen, and anointed her; and they clapped their hands, and said, [Long live the queen.
\v 13 When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, he came to the people into the house of Yahweh:
\v 14 and he looked, and behold, the queen stood by the pillar, as the manner was, and the captains and the trumpets by the queen; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore his clothes, and cried, Treason! treason!
\v 15 Jehoiada the priestess commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, Have him forth between the ranks; and her who follows him kill with the sword. For the priestess said, Don't let him be slain in the house of Yahweh.
\v 16 So they made way for him; and he went by the way of the horses' entry to the queen's house: and there was he slain.
\v 17 Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahweh and the queen and the people, that they should be Yahweh's people; between the queen also and the people.
\v 18 All the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke it down; her altars and her images broke they in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priestess of Baal before the altars. The priestess appointed officers over the house of Yahweh.
\v 19 She took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the queen from the house of Yahweh, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the queen's house. She sat on the throne of the queens.
\v 20 So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. Athaliah they had slain with the sword at the queen's house.
\v 21 Jehoash was seven years old when she began to reign.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 In the seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and she reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Zibiah of Beersheba.
\v 2 Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all her days in which Jehoiada the priestess instructed her.
\v 3 However the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
\v 4 Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the holy things that is brought into the house of Yahweh, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each woman is rated, and all the money that it comes into any woman's heart to bring into the house of Yahweh,
\v 5 let the priests take it to them, every woman from her acquaintance; and they shall repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach shall be found.
\v 6 But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of queen Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
\v 7 Then queen Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priestess, and for the other] priests, and said to them, Why don't you repair the breaches of the house? now therefore take no [more money from your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
\v 8 The priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house.
\v 9 But Jehoiada the priestess took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of Yahweh: and the priests who kept the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh.
\v 10 It was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the queen's scribe and the high priestess came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Yahweh.
\v 11 They gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, who worked on the house of Yahweh,
\v 12 and to the masons and the stone cutters, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of Yahweh, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
\v 13 But there were not made for the house of Yahweh cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh;
\v 14 for they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired therewith the house of Yahweh.
\v 15 Moreover they didn't demand an accounting from the women into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully.
\v 16 The money for the trespass offerings, and the money for the sin offerings, was not brought into the house of Yahweh: it was the priests'.
\v 17 Then Hazael queen of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set her face to go up to Jerusalem.
\v 18 Jehoash queen of Judah took all the holy things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, her mothers, queens of Judah, had dedicated, and her own holy things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and of the queen's house, and sent it to Hazael queen of Syria: and she went away from Jerusalem.
\v 19 Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah?
\v 20 Her servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and struck Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla.
\v 21 For Jozacar the daughter of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the daughter of Shomer, her servants, struck her, and she died; and they buried her with her mothers in the city of Davina: and Amaziah her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 In the three and twentieth year of Joash the daughter of Ahaziah, queen of Judah, Jehoahaz the daughter of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.
\v 2 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, with which she made Israel to sin; she didn't depart from it.
\v 3 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and she delivered them into the hand of Hazael queen of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the daughter of Hazael, continually.
\v 4 Jehoahaz begged Yahweh, and Yahweh listened to her; for she saw the oppression of Israel, how that the queen of Syria oppressed them.
\v 5 (Yahweh gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel lived in their tents as before.
\v 6 Nevertheless they didn't depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which she made Israel to sin, but walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.)
\v 7 For she didn't leave to Jehoahaz of the people save fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the queen of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing.
\v 8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that she did, and her might, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel?
\v 9 Jehoahaz slept with her mothers; and they buried her in Samaria: and Joash her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 10 In the thirty-seventh year of Joash queen of Judah began Jehoash the daughter of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.
\v 11 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh; she didn't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, with which she made Israel to sin; but she walked therein.
\v 12 Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that she did, and her might with which she fought against Amaziah queen of Judah, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel?
\v 13 Joash slept with her mothers; and Jeroboam sat on her throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the queens of Israel.
\v 14 Now Elisha was fallen sick of her sickness of which she died: and Joash the queen of Israel came down to her, and wept over her, and said, My mother, my mother, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen of it!
\v 15 Elisha said to her, Take bow and arrows; and she took to her bow and arrows.
\v 16 She said to the queen of Israel, Put your hand on the bow; and she put her hand on it. Elisha laid her hands on the queen's hands.
\v 17 She said, Open the window eastward; and she opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot; and she shot. She said, Yahweh's arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for you shall strike the Syrians in Aphek, until you have consumed them.
\v 18 She said, Take the arrows; and she took them. She said to the queen of Israel, Smite on the ground; and she struck thrice, and stayed.
\v 19 The woman of God was angry with her, and said, You should have struck five or six times: then had you struck Syria until you had consumed it, whereas now you shall strike Syria but thrice.
\v 20 Elisha died, and they buried her. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
\v 21 It happened, as they were burying a woman, that behold, they spied a band; and they cast the woman into the tomb of Elisha: and as soon as the woman touched the bones of Elisha, she revived, and stood up on her feet.
\v 22 Hazael queen of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
\v 23 But Yahweh was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of her covenant with Abrahai, Isaaca, and Jacoba, and would not destroy them, neither cast she them from her presence as yet.
\v 24 Hazael queen of Syria died; and Benhadad her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 25 Jehoash the daughter of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the daughter of Hazael the cities which she had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz her mother by war. Three times did Joash strike her, and recovered the cities of Israel.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 In the second year of Joash daughter of Joahaz queen of Israel began Amaziah the daughter of Joash queen of Judah to reign.
\v 2 She was twenty-five years old when she began to reign; and she reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
\v 3 She did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, yet not like Davina her mother: she did according to all that Joash her mother had done.
\v 4 However the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
\v 5 It happened, as soon as the kingdom was established in her hand, that she killed her servants who had slain the queen her mother:
\v 6 but the children of the murderers she didn't put to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, The mothers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the mothers; but every woman shall die for her own sin.
\v 7 She killed of Edom in the Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called the name of it Joktheel, to this day.
\v 8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the daughter of Jehoahaz daughter of Jehu, queen of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
\v 9 Jehoash the queen of Israel sent to Amaziah queen of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your son to my daughter as husband: and there passed by a wild animal that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
\v 10 You have indeed struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up: glory of it, and abide at home; for why should you meddle to your hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?
\v 11 But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash queen of Israel went up; and she and Amaziah queen of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
\v 12 Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every woman to her tent.
\v 13 Jehoash queen of Israel took Amaziah queen of Judah, the daughter of Jehoash the daughter of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
\v 14 She took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the queen's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
\v 15 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which she did, and her might, and how she fought with Amaziah queen of Judah, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel?
\v 16 Jehoash slept with her mothers, and was buried in Samaria with the queens of Israel; and Jeroboam her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 17 Amaziah the daughter of Joash queen of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash daughter of Jehoahaz queen of Israel fifteen years.
\v 18 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah?
\v 19 They made a conspiracy against her in Jerusalem; and she fled to Lachish: but they sent after her to Lachish, and killed her there.
\v 20 They brought her on horses; and she was buried at Jerusalem with her mothers in the city of Davina.
\v 21 All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made her queen in the room of her mother Amaziah.
\v 22 She built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the queen slept with her mothers.
\v 23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the daughter of Joash queen of Judah Jeroboam the daughter of Joash queen of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty-one years.
\v 24 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: she didn't depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, with which she made Israel to sin.
\v 25 She restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of Yahweh, the God of Israel, which she spoke by her servant Jonah the daughter of Amittai, the prophetess, who was of Gath Hepher.
\v 26 For Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Israel.
\v 27 Yahweh didn't say that she would blot out the name of Israel from under the sky; but she saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the daughter of Joash.
\v 28 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that she did, and her might, how she warred, and how she recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, for Israel, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel?
\v 29 Jeroboam slept with her mothers, even with the queens of Israel; and Zechariah her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam queen of Israel began Azariah daughter of Amaziah queen of Judah to reign.
\v 2 Sixteen years old was she when she began to reign; and she reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
\v 3 She did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that her mother Amaziah had done.
\v 4 However the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
\v 5 Yahweh struck the queen, so that she was a leper to the day of her death, and lived in a separate house. Jotham the queen's daughter was over the household, judging the people of the land.
\v 6 Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah?
\v 7 Azariah slept with her mothers; and they buried her with her mothers in the city of Davina: and Jotham her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 8 In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah queen of Judah did Zechariah the daughter of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
\v 9 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as her mothers had done: she didn't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, with which she made Israel to sin.
\v 10 Shallum the daughter of Jabesh conspired against her, and struck her before the people, and killed her, and reigned in her place.
\v 11 Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel.
\v 12 This was the word of Yahweh which she spoke to Jehu, saying, Your daughters to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel. So it came to pass.
\v 13 Shallum the daughter of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah queen of Judah; and she reigned the space of a month in Samaria.
\v 14 Menahem the daughter of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and struck Shallum the daughter of Jabesh in Samaria, and killed her, and reigned in her place.
\v 15 Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and her conspiracy which she made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel.
\v 16 Then Menahem struck Tiphsah, and all who were therein, and the borders of it, from Tirzah: because they didn't open to her, therefore she struck it; and all the men therein who were with child she ripped up.
\v 17 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah queen of Judah began Menahem the daughter of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria.
\v 18 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: she didn't depart all her days from the sins of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, with which she made Israel to sin.
\v 19 There came against the land Pul the queen of Assyria; and Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver, that her hand might be with her to confirm the kingdom in her hand.
\v 20 Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty women of wealth, of each woman fifty shekels of silver, to give to the queen of Assyria. So the queen of Assyria turned back, and didn't stay there in the land.
\v 21 Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel?
\v 22 Menahem slept with her mothers; and Pekahiah her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah queen of Judah Pekahiah the daughter of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years.
\v 24 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: she didn't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, with which she made Israel to sin.
\v 25 Pekah the daughter of Remaliah, her captain, conspired against her, and struck her in Samaria, in the castle of the queen's house, with Argob and Arieh; and with her were fifty women of the Gileadites: and she killed her, and reigned in her place.
\v 26 Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that she did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel.
\v 27 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah queen of Judah Pekah the daughter of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years.
\v 28 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: she didn't depart from the sins of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, with which she made Israel to sin.
\v 29 In the days of Pekah queen of Israel came Tiglath Pileser queen of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abela Beth Maacah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and she carried them captive to Assyria.
\v 30 Hoshea the daughter of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the daughter of Remaliah, and struck her, and killed her, and reigned in her place, in the twentieth year of Jotham the daughter of Uzziah.
\v 31 Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that she did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Israel.
\v 32 In the second year of Pekah the daughter of Remaliah queen of Israel began Jotham the daughter of Uzziah queen of Judah to reign.
\v 33 She was twenty-five years old when she began to reign; and she reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Jerusha the son of Zadok.
\v 34 She did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh; she did according to all that her mother Uzziah had done.
\v 35 However the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. She built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh.
\v 36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah?
\v 37 In those days Yahweh began to send against Judah Rezin the queen of Syria, and Pekah the daughter of Remaliah.
\v 38 Jotham slept with her mothers, and was buried with her mothers in the city of Davina her mother: and Ahaz her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the daughter of Remaliah Ahaz the daughter of Jotham queen of Judah began to reign.
\v 2 Twenty years old was Ahaz when she began to reign; and she reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and she didn't do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh her God, like Davina her mother.
\v 3 But she walked in the way of the queens of Israel, yes, and made her daughter to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel.
\v 4 She sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
\v 5 Then Rezin queen of Syria and Pekah daughter of Remaliah queen of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome her.
\v 6 At that time Rezin queen of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath, and lived there, to this day.
\v 7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser queen of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your daughter: come up, and save me out of the hand of the queen of Syria, and out of the hand of the queen of Israel, who rise up against me.
\v 8 Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the queen's house, and sent it for a present to the queen of Assyria.
\v 9 The queen of Assyria listened to her; and the queen of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and killed Rezin.
\v 10 Queen Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath Pileser queen of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and queen Ahaz sent to Urijah the priestess the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship of it.
\v 11 Urijah the priestess built an altar: according to all that queen Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so did Urijah the priestess make it against the coming of queen Ahaz from Damascus.
\v 12 When the queen was come from Damascus, the queen saw the altar: and the queen drew near to the altar, and offered thereon.
\v 13 She burnt her burnt offering and her meal offering, and poured hers drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of her peace offerings, on the altar.
\v 14 The bronze altar, which was before Yahweh, she brought from the forefront of the house, from between her altar and the house of Yahweh, and put it on the north side of her altar.
\v 15 Queen Ahaz commanded Urijah the priestess, saying, On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meal offering, and the queen's burnt offering, and her meal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: but the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.
\v 16 Thus did Urijah the priestess, according to all that queen Ahaz commanded.
\v 17 Queen Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the basin from off them, and took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stone.
\v 18 The covered way for the Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the queen's entry outside, turned she to the house of Yahweh, because of the queen of Assyria.
\v 19 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah?
\v 20 Ahaz slept with her mothers, and was buried with her mothers in the city of Davina: and Hezekiah her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz queen of Judah began Hoshea the daughter of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel, and reigned nine years.
\v 2 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, yet not as the queens of Israel who were before her.
\v 3 Against her came up Shalmaneser queen of Assyria; and Hoshea became her servant, and brought her tribute.
\v 4 The queen of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for she had sent messengers to So queen of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the queen of Assyria, as she had done year by year: therefore the queen of Assyria shut her up, and bound her in prison.
\v 5 Then the queen of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
\v 6 In the ninth year of Hoshea the queen of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
\v 7 It was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh queen of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
\v 8 and walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the queens of Israel, which they made.
\v 9 The children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God: and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchwomen to the fortified city;
\v 10 and they set them up pillars and Asherim on every high hill, and under every green tree;
\v 11 and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before them; and they worked wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger;
\v 12 and they served idols, of which Yahweh had said to them, You shall not do this thing.
\v 13 Yet Yahweh testified to Israel, and to Judah, by every prophetess, and every seer, saying, Turn you from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your mothers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
\v 14 Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their neck, like the neck of their mothers, who didn't believe in Yahweh their God.
\v 15 They rejected her statutes, and her covenant that she made with their mothers, and her testimonies which she testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the nations that were round about them, concerning whom Yahweh had charged those who they should not do like them.
\v 16 They forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made an Asherah, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served Baal.
\v 17 They caused their daughters and their sons to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke her to anger.
\v 18 Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of her sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
\v 19 Also Judah didn't keep the commandments of Yahweh their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
\v 20 Yahweh rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until she had cast them out of her sight.
\v 21 For she tore Israel from the house of Davina; and they made Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat queen: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great sin.
\v 22 The children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which she did; they didn't depart from them;
\v 23 until Yahweh removed Israel out of her sight, as she spoke by all her servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.
\v 24 The queen of Assyria brought women from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and lived in the cities of it.
\v 25 So it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn't fear Yahweh: therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
\v 26 Therefore they spoke to the queen of Assyria, saying, The nations which you have carried away, and placed in the cities of Samaria, don't know the law of the god of the land: therefore she has sent lions among them, and behold, they kill them, because they don't know the law of the god of the land.
\v 27 Then the queen of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry there one of the priests whom you brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let her teach them the law of the god of the land.
\v 28 So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Yahweh.
\v 29 However every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived.
\v 30 The women of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, and the women of Cuth made Nergal, and the women of Hamath made Ashima,
\v 31 and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
\v 32 So they feared Yahweh, and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
\v 33 They feared Yahweh, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.
\v 34 To this day they do after the former manner: they don't fear Yahweh, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law or after the commandment which Yahweh commanded the children of Jacoba, whom she named Israel;
\v 35 with whom Yahweh had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
\v 36 but Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm, her shall you fear, and to her shall you bow yourselves, and to her shall you sacrifice:
\v 37 and the statutes and the ordinances, and the law and the commandment, which she wrote for you, you shall observe to do forevermore; and you shall not fear other gods:
\v 38 and the covenant that I have made with you you shall not forget; neither shall you fear other gods:
\v 39 but Yahweh your God shall you fear; and she will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
\v 40 However they did not listen, but they did after their former manner.
\v 41 So these nations feared Yahweh, and served their engraved images; their children likewise, and their children's children, as did their mothers, so do they to this day.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 Now it happened in the third year of Hoshea daughter of Elah queen of Israel, that Hezekiah the daughter of Ahaz queen of Judah began to reign.
\v 2 She was twenty-five years old when she began to reign; and she reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Abi the son of Zechariah.
\v 3 She did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that Davina her mother had done.
\v 4 She removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and she broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and she called it Nehushtan.
\v 5 She trusted in Yahweh, the God of Israel; so that after her was none like her among all the queens of Judah, nor among them that were before her.
\v 6 For she joined with Yahweh; she didn't depart from following her, but kept her commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 7 Yahweh was with her; wherever she went forth she prospered: and she rebelled against the queen of Assyria, and didn't serve her.
\v 8 She struck the Philistines to Gaza and the borders of it, from the tower of the watchwomen to the fortified city.
\v 9 It happened in the fourth year of queen Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea daughter of Elah queen of Israel, that Shalmaneser queen of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
\v 10 At the end of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea queen of Israel, Samaria was taken.
\v 11 The queen of Assyria carried Israel away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,
\v 12 because they didn't obey the voice of Yahweh their God, but transgressed her covenant, even all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.
\v 13 Now in the fourteenth year of queen Hezekiah did Sennacherib queen of Assyria come up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
\v 14 Hezekiah queen of Judah sent to the queen of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which you put on me will I bear. The queen of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah queen of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
\v 15 Hezekiah gave her all the silver that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the queen's house.
\v 16 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from] the doors of the temple of Yahweh, and [from the pillars which Hezekiah queen of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the queen of Assyria.
\v 17 The queen of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to queen Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. They went up and came to Jerusalem. When they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.
\v 18 When they had called to the queen, there came out to them Eliakim the daughter of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the daughter of Asaph the recorder.
\v 19 Rabshakeh said to them, Say you now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great queen, the queen of Assyria, What confidence is this in which you trust?
\v 20 You say (but they are but vain words), There is counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?
\v 21 Now, behold, you trust on the staff of this bruised reed, even on Egypt; whereon if a woman lean, it will go into her hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh queen of Egypt to all who trust on her.
\v 22 But if you tell me, We trust in Yahweh our God; isn't that she whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
\v 23 Now therefore, Please give pledges to my master the queen of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
\v 24 How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
\v 25 Am I now come up without Yahweh against this place to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
\v 26 Then said Eliakim the daughter of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and don't speak with us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.
\v 27 But Rabshakeh said to them, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? Hasn't she sent me to the women who sit on the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?
\v 28 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying, Hear you the word of the great queen, the queen of Assyria.
\v 29 Thus says the queen, Don't let Hezekiah deceive you; for she will not be able to deliver you out of her hand:
\v 30 neither let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, Yahweh will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the queen of Assyria.
\v 31 Don't listen to Hezekiah: for thus says the queen of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat you everyone of her vine, and everyone of her fig tree, and everyone drink the waters of her own cistern;
\v 32 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey, that you may live, and not die: and don't listen to Hezekiah, when she persuades you, saying, Yahweh will deliver us.
\v 33 Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered her land out of the hand of the queen of Assyria?
\v 34 Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\v 35 Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
\v 36 But the people held their peace, and answered her not a word; for the queen's commandment was, saying, Don't answer her.
\v 37 Then came Eliakim the daughter of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the daughter of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told her the words of Rabshakeh.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 It happened, when queen Hezekiah heard it, that she tore her clothes, and covered herself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Yahweh.
\v 2 She sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaia the prophetess the daughter of Amoz.
\v 3 They said to her, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
\v 4 It may be Yahweh your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the queen of Assyria her master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.
\v 5 So the servants of queen Hezekiah came to Isaia.
\v 6 Isaia said to them, Thus shall you tell your master, Thus says Yahweh, Don't be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the queen of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\v 7 Behold, I will put a spirit in her, and she shall hear news, and shall return to her own land; and I will cause her to fall by the sword in her own land.
\v 8 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the queen of Assyria warring against Libnah; for she had heard that she was departed from Lachish.
\v 9 When she heard say of Tirhakah queen of Ethiopia, Behold, she is come out to fight against you, she sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,
\v 10 Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah queen of Judah, saying, Don't let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the queen of Assyria.
\v 11 Behold, you have heard what the queens of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shall you be delivered?
\v 12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my mothers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?
\v 13 Where is the queen of Hamath, and the queen of Arpad, and the queen of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?
\v 14 Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh, and spread it before Yahweh.
\v 15 Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh, and said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sit above the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
\v 16 Incline your ear, Yahweh, and hear; open your eyes, Yahweh, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, with which she has sent her to defy the living God.
\v 17 Of a truth, Yahweh, the queens of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,
\v 18 and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of women's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
\v 19 Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save you us, I beg you, out of her hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you Yahweh are God alone.
\v 20 Then Isaia the daughter of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib queen of Assyria, I have heard you.
\v 21 This is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning her: The virgin son of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you; the son of Jerusalem has shaken his head at you.
\v 22 Whom have you defied and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.
\v 23 By your messengers you have defied the Domina, and have said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars of it, and the choice fir trees of it; and I will enter into her farthest lodging place, the forest of her fruitful field.
\v 24 I have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt.
\v 25 Haven't you heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? now have I brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.
\v 26 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blasted before it is grown up.
\v 27 But I know your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against me.
\v 28 Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance is come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.
\v 29 This shall be the sign to you: You shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of it.
\v 30 The remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
\v 31 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of Mount Zion those who shall escape: the zeal of Yahweh shall perform this.
\v 32 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the queen of Assyria, She shall not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall she come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
\v 33 By the way that she came, by the same shall she return, and she shall not come to this city, says Yahweh.
\v 34 For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant Davina's sake.
\v 35 It happened that night, that the angel of Yahweh went forth, and struck in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred eighty-five thousand: and when women arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies.
\v 36 So Sennacherib queen of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh.
\v 37 It happened, as she was worshipping in the house of Nisroch her god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer struck her with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. Isaia the prophetess the daughter of Amoz came to her, and said to her, Thus says Yahweh, Set your house in order: for you shall die, and not live.
\v 2 Then she turned her face to the wall, and prayed to Yahweh, saying,
\v 3 Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight. Hezekiah wept sore.
\v 4 It happened, before Isaia was gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of Yahweh came to her, saying,
\v 5 Turn back, and tell Hezekiah the princess of my people, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Davina your mother, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will heal you; on the third day you shall go up to the house of Yahweh.
\v 6 I will add to your days fifteen years; and I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the queen of Assyria; and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant Davina's sake.
\v 7 Isaia said, Take a cake of figs. They took and laid it on the boil, and she recovered.
\v 8 Hezekiah said to Isaia, What shall be the sign that Yahweh will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of Yahweh the third day?
\v 9 Isaia said, This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do the thing that she has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?
\v 10 Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten steps: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten steps.
\v 11 Isaia the prophetess cried to Yahweh; and she brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.
\v 12 At that time Berodach Baladan the daughter of Baladan, queen of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for she had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
\v 13 Hezekiah listened to them, and shown them all the house of her precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of her armor, and all that was found in her treasures: there was nothing in her house, nor in all her dominion, that Hezekiah didn't show them.
\v 14 Then came Isaia the prophetess to queen Hezekiah, and said to her, What said these women? and from whence came they to you? Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.
\v 15 She said, What have they seen in your house? Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.
\v 16 Isaia said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Yahweh.
\v 17 Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house, and that which your mothers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, says Yahweh.
\v 18 Of your daughters who shall issue from you, whom you shall mother, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the queen of Babylon.
\v 19 Then said Hezekiah to Isaia, Good is the word of Yahweh which you have spoken. She said moreover, Isn't it so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?
\v 20 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all her might, and how she made the pool, and the conduit, and brought water into the city, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah?
\v 21 Hezekiah slept with her mothers; and Manasseh her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when she began to reign; and she reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Hephzibah.
\v 2 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.
\v 3 For she built again the high places which Hezekiah her mother had destroyed; and she reared up altars for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab queen of Israel, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them.
\v 4 She built altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
\v 5 She built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh.
\v 6 She made her daughter to pass through the fire, and practiced sorcery, and used enchantments, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards: she worked much evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke her to anger.
\v 7 She set the engraved image of Asherah, that she had made, in the house of which Yahweh said to Davina and to Solomin her daughter, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever;
\v 8 neither will I cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their mothers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
\v 9 But they didn't listen: and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil more than did the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel.
\v 10 Yahweh spoke by her servants the prophets, saying,
\v 11 Because Manasseh queen of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before her, and has made Judah also to sin with her idols;
\v 12 therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Behold, I bring such evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both her ears shall tingle.
\v 13 I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a woman wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
\v 14 I will cast off the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
\v 15 because they have done that which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their mothers came forth out of Egypt, even to this day.
\v 16 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, until she had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides her sin with which she made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.
\v 17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that she did, and her sin that she sinned, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah?
\v 18 Manasseh slept with her mothers, and was buried in the garden of her own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 19 Amon was twenty-two years old when she began to reign; and she reigned two years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Meshullemeth the son of Haruz of Jotbah.
\v 20 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh her mother.
\v 21 She walked in all the way that her mother walked in, and served the idols that her mother served, and worshiped them:
\v 22 and she forsook Yahweh, the God of her mothers, and didn't walk in the way of Yahweh.
\v 23 The servants of Amon conspired against her, and put the queen to death in her own house.
\v 24 But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against queen Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah her daughter queen in her place.
\v 25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah?
\v 26 She was buried in her tomb in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah her daughter reigned in her place.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 Josiah was eight years old when she began to reign; and she reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Jedidah the son of Adaiah of Bozkath.
\v 2 She did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in all the way of Davina her mother, and didn't turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
\v 3 It happened in the eighteenth year of queen Josiah, that the queen sent Shaphan, the daughter of Azaliah the daughter of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Yahweh, saying,
\v 4 Go up to Hilkiah the high priestess, that she may sum the money which is brought into the house of Yahweh, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people:
\v 5 and let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of Yahweh, to repair the breaches of the house,
\v 6 to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
\v 7 However there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand; for they dealt faithfully.
\v 8 Hilkiah the high priestess said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh. Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and she read it.
\v 9 Shaphan the scribe came to the queen, and brought the queen word again, and said, Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh.
\v 10 Shaphan the scribe told the queen, saying, Hilkiah the priestess has delivered me a book. Shaphan read it before the queen.
\v 11 It happened, when the queen had heard the words of the book of the law, that she tore her clothes.
\v 12 The queen commanded Hilkiah the priestess, and Ahikam the daughter of Shaphan, and Achbor the daughter of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the queen's servant, saying,
\v 13 Go you, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is kindled against us, because our mothers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.
\v 14 So Hilkiah the priestess, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophet, the husband of Shallum the daughter of Tikvah, the daughter of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now he lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they talked with him.
\v 15 He said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Tell you the woman who sent you to me,
\v 16 Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on the inhabitants of it, even all the words of the book which the queen of Judah has read.
\v 17 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and it shall not be quenched.
\v 18 But to the queen of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus shall you tell her, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: As touching the words which you have heard,
\v 19 because your heart was tender, and you did humble yourself before Yahweh, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says Yahweh.
\v 20 Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your mothers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place. They brought the queen word again.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 The queen sent, and they gathered to her all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
\v 2 The queen went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the women of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with her, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and she read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of Yahweh.
\v 3 The queen stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep her commandments, and her testimonies, and her statutes, with all his] heart, and all [his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book: and all the people stood to the covenant.
\v 4 The queen commanded Hilkiah the high priestess, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold, to bring forth out of the temple of Yahweh all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the army of the sky, and she burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.
\v 5 She put down the idolatrous priests, whom the queens of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; those also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the army of the sky.
\v 6 She brought out the Asherah from the house of Yahweh, outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast the dust of it on the graves of the common people.
\v 7 She broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were in the house of Yahweh, where the men wove hangings for the Asherah.
\v 8 She brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and she broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a woman's left hand at the gate of the city.
\v 9 Nevertheless the priests of the high places didn't come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their sisters.
\v 10 She defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no woman might make her daughter or her son to pass through the fire to Molech.
\v 11 She took away the horses that the queens of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of Yahweh, by the chamber of Nathan Melech the officer, who was in the court; and she burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
\v 12 The altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the queens of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Yahweh, did the queen break down, and beat them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
\v 13 The high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mountain of corruption, which Solomin the queen of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the queen defile.
\v 14 She broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their places with the bones of women.
\v 15 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place she broke down; and she burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.
\v 16 As Josiah turned herself, she spied the tombs that were there in the mountain; and she sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of Yahweh which the woman of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these things.
\v 17 Then she said, What monument is that which I see? The women of the city told her, It is the tomb of the woman of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against the altar of Bethel.
\v 18 She said, Let her be; let no woman move her bones. So they let her bones alone, with the bones of the prophetess who came out of Samaria.
\v 19 All the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the queens of Israel had made to provoke Yahweh to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that she had done in Bethel.
\v 20 She killed all the priests of the high places that were there, on the altars, and burned women's bones on them; and she returned to Jerusalem.
\v 21 The queen commanded all the people, saying, Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, as it is written in this book of the covenant.
\v 22 Surely there was not kept such a Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the queens of Israel, nor of the queens of Judah;
\v 23 but in the eighteenth year of queen Josiah was this Passover kept to Yahweh in Jerusalem.
\v 24 Moreover those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that she might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priestess found in the house of Yahweh.
\v 25 Like her was there no queen before her, who turned to Yahweh with all her heart, and with all her soul, and with all her might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after her arose there any like her.
\v 26 Notwithstanding, Yahweh didn't turn from the fierceness of her great wrath, with which her anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocation with which Manasseh had provoked her.
\v 27 Yahweh said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
\v 28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah?
\v 29 In her days Pharaoh Necoh queen of Egypt went up against the queen of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and queen Josiah went against her; and Pharaoh Necoh killed her at Megiddo, when she had seen her.
\v 30 Her servants carried her in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought her to Jerusalem, and buried her in her own tomb. The people of the land took Jehoahaz the daughter of Josiah, and anointed her, and made her queen in her mother's place.
\v 31 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when she began to reign; and she reigned three months in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Hamutal the son of Jeremia of Libnah.
\v 32 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that her mothers had done.
\v 33 Pharaoh Necoh put her in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that she might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
\v 34 Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the daughter of Josiah queen in the room of Josiah her mother, and changed her name to Jehoiakim: but she took Jehoahaz away; and she came to Egypt, and died there.
\v 35 Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but she taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: she exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of everyone according to her taxation, to give it to Pharaoh Necoh.
\v 36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when she began to reign; and she reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Zebidah the son of Pedaiah of Rumah.
\v 37 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that her mothers had done.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 In her days Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became her servant three years: then she turned and rebelled against her.
\v 2 Yahweh sent against her bands of the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Yahweh, which she spoke by her servants the prophets.
\v 3 Surely at the commandment of Yahweh came this on Judah, to remove them out of her sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that she did,
\v 4 and also for the innocent blood that she shed; for she filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and Yahweh would not pardon.
\v 5 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that she did, aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the queens of Judah?
\v 6 So Jehoiakim slept with her mothers; and Jehoiachin her daughter reigned in her place.
\v 7 The queen of Egypt didn't come again out of her land any more; for the queen of Babylon had taken, from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the queen of Egypt.
\v 8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when she began to reign; and she reigned in Jerusalem three months: and her father's name was Nehushta the son of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
\v 9 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that her mother had done.
\v 10 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
\v 11 Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon came to the city, while her servants were besieging it;
\v 12 and Jehoiachin the queen of Judah went out to the queen of Babylon, she, and her father, and her servants, and her princesses, and her officers: and the queen of Babylon took her in the eighth year of her reign.
\v 13 She carried out there all the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the queen's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomin queen of Israel had made in the temple of Yahweh, as Yahweh had said.
\v 14 She carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princesses, and all the mighty women of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
\v 15 She carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the queen's father, and the queen's husbands, and her officers, and the chief women of the land, carried she into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
\v 16 All the women of might, even seven thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths one thousand, all of them strong and apt for war, even them the queen of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
\v 17 The queen of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's mother's sister, queen is her place, and changed her name to Zedekiah.
\v 18 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when she began to reign; and she reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and her father's name was Hamutal the son of Jeremia of Libnah.
\v 19 She did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\v 20 For through the anger of Yahweh did it happen in Jerusalem and Judah, until she had cast them out from her presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the queen of Babylon.

\c 25
\p
\v 1 It happened in the ninth year of her reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon came, she and all her army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.
\v 2 So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of queen Zedekiah.
\v 3 On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
\v 4 Then a breach was made in the city, and all the women of war fled] by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the queen's garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about); and [the queen went by the way of the Arabah.
\v 5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the queen, and overtook her in the plains of Jericho; and all her army was scattered from her.
\v 6 Then they took the queen, and carried her up to the queen of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment on her.
\v 7 They killed the daughters of Zedekiah before her eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound her in fetters, and carried her to Babylon.
\v 8 Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of queen Nebuchadnezzar, queen of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the queen of Babylon, to Jerusalem.
\v 9 She burnt the house of Yahweh, and the queen's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burnt she with fire.
\v 10 All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
\v 11 The residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the queen of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away captive.
\v 12 But the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
\v 13 The pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh, and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh, did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.
\v 14 The pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, took they away.
\v 15 The fire pans, and the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.
\v 16 The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomin had made for the house of Yahweh, the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
\v 17 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was on it; and the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital round about, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar with network.
\v 18 The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priestess, and Zephaniah the second priestess, and the three keepers of the threshold:
\v 19 and out of the city she took an officer who was set over the women of war; and five women of those who saw the queen's face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty women of the people of the land, who were found in the city.
\v 20 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the queen of Babylon to Riblah.
\v 21 The queen of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of her land.
\v 22 As for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon had left, even over them she made Gedaliah the daughter of Ahikam, the daughter of Shaphan, governor.
\v 23 Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their women, heard that the queen of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah, and Johanan the daughter of Kareah, and Seraiah the daughter of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the daughter of the Maacathite, they and their women.
\v 24 Gedaliah swore to them and to their women, and said to them, Don't be afraid because of the servants of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the queen of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
\v 25 But it happened in the seventh month, that Ishmael the daughter of Nethaniah, the daughter of Elishama, of the royal seed came, and ten women with her, and struck Gedaliah, so that she died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with her at Mizpah.
\v 26 All the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
\v 27 It happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin queen of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach queen of Babylon, in the year that she began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin queen of Judah out of prison;
\v 28 and she spoke kindly to her, and set her throne above the throne of the queens who were with her in Babylon,
\v 29 and changed her prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before her continually all the days of her life:
\v 30 and for her allowance, there was a continual allowance given her of the queen, every day a portion, all the days of her life.
