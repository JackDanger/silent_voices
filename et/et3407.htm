<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Daniel Chapter 7</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed; then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Daniel spoke and said: I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven broke forth upon the great sea.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings; I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon two feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was said thus unto it: 'Arise, devour much flesh.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the sides of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was as white snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke, I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the Ancient of days, and he was brought near before Him.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<P><B>15</B> As for me Daniel, my spirit was pained in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head affrighted me.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things:
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> 'These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell; even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose appearance was greater than that of its fellows.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High; and the time came, and the saints possessed the kingdom.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> Thus he said: 'The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise; and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> But the judgment shall sit, and his dominions shall be taken away, to be consumed and to be destroy unto the end.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.'
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> Here is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much affrighted me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart. <B>{P}</B></P>
