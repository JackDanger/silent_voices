<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And he said: The LORD came from Sinai, and rose from Seir unto them; He shined forth from mount Paran, and He came from the myriads holy, at His right hand was a fiery law unto them.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Yea, He loveth the peoples, all His holy ones--they are in Thy hand; and they sit down at Thy feet, receiving of Thy words.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Moses commanded us a law, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And there was a king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Israel together.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Let Reuben live, and not die in that his men become few. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And this for Judah, and he said: Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him in unto his people; his hands shall contend for him, and Thou shalt be a help against his adversaries. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<P><B>8</B> And of Levi he said: Thy Thummim and Thy Urim be with Thy holy one, whom Thou didst prove at Massah, with whom Thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Who said of his father, and of his mother: 'I have not seen him'; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew he his own children; for they have observed Thy word, and keep Thy covenant.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> They shall teach Jacob Thine ordinances, and Israel Thy law; they shall put incense before Thee, and whole burnt-offering upon Thine altar.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise up against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Of Benjamin he said: The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by Him; He covereth him all the day, and He dwelleth between his shoulders. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And of Joseph he said: Blessed of the LORD be his land; for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, and for the precious things of the yield of the moons,
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And for the tops of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the everlasting hills,
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof, and the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush; let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brethren.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> His firstling bullock, majesty is his; and his horns are the horns of the wild-ox; with them he shall gore the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth; and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out, and, Issachar, in thy tents.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> They shall call peoples unto the mountain; there shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness; for they shall suck the abundance of the seas, and the hidden treasures of the sand. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And of Gad he said: Blessed be He that enlargeth Gad; he dwelleth as a lioness, and teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And he chose a first part for himself, for there a portion of a ruler was reserved; and there came the heads of the people, he executed the righteousness of the LORD, and His ordinances with Israel. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And of Dan he said: Dan is a lion's whelp, that leapeth forth from Bashan.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And of Naphtali he said: O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the sea and the south. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And of Asher he said: Blessed be Asher above sons; let him be the favoured of his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> Iron and brass shall be thy bars; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven as thy help, and in His excellency on the skies.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> The eternal God is a dwelling-place, and underneath are the everlasting arms; and He thrust out the enemy from before thee, and said: 'Destroy.'
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And Israel dwelleth in safety, the fountain of Jacob alone, in a land of corn and wine; yea, his heavens drop down dew.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> Happy art thou, O Israel, who is like unto thee? a people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and that is the sword of thy excellency! And thine enemies shall dwindle away before thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places. <B>{S}</B></P>
