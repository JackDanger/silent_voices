<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Ecclesiastes Chapter 1</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> The words of Koheleth, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Vanity of vanities, saith Koheleth; vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> What profit hath man of all his labour wherein he laboureth under the sun?
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; and the earth abideth for ever.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he ariseth.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it turneth about continually in its circuit, and the wind returneth again to its circuits.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> All things toil to weariness; man cannot utter it, the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> That which hath been is that which shall be, and that which hath been done is that which shall be done; and there is nothing new under the sun.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Is there a thing whereof it is said: 'See, this is new'?--it hath been already, in the ages which were before us.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> There is no remembrance of them of former times; neither shall there be any remembrance of them of latter times that are to come, among those that shall come after. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<P><B>12</B> I Koheleth have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven; it is a sore task that God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> I spoke with my own heart, saying: 'Lo, I have gotten great wisdom, more also than all that were before me over Jerusalem'; yea, my heart hath had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly--I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> For in much wisdom is much vexation; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</P>
