<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Now Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons: 'Why do ye look one upon another?'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And he said: 'Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt. Get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.'
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn from Egypt.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said: 'Lest peradventure harm befall him.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down to him with their faces to the earth.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spoke roughly with them; and he said unto them: 'Whence come ye?' And they said: 'From the land of Canaan to buy food.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew him not.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them: 'Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And they said unto him: 'Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> We are all one man's sons; we are upright men, thy servants are no spies.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And he said unto them: 'Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And they said: 'We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And Joseph said unto them: 'That is it that I spoke unto you, saying: Ye are spies.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Hereby ye shall be proved, as Pharaoh liveth, ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you; or else, as Pharaoh liveth, surely ye are spies.'
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And he put them all together into ward three days.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And Joseph said unto them the third day. 'This do, and live; for I fear God:
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> if ye be upright men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses;
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die.' And they did so.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And they said one to another: 'We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.'
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And Reuben answered them, saying: 'Spoke I not unto you, saying: Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.'
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for the interpreter was between them.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and thus was it done unto them.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And they laded their asses with their corn, and departed thence.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And he said unto his brethren: 'My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack.' And their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying: 'What is this that God hath done unto us?'
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying:
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> 'The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> And we said unto him: We are upright men; we are no spies.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> We are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us: Hereby shall I know that ye are upright men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take corn for the famine of your houses, and go your way.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> And bring your youngest brother unto me; then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are upright men; so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.'
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> And Jacob their father said unto them: 'Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away; upon me are all these things come.'
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying: 'Thou shalt slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee; deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him back to thee.'
<A NAME="38"> </A>
<B>38</B> And he said: 'My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left; if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</P>
