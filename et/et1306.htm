<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> 'Come, and let us return unto the LORD; for He hath torn, and He will heal us, He hath smitten, and He will bind us up.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> After two days will He revive us, on the third day He will raise us up, that we may live in His presence.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And let us know, eagerly strive to know the LORD, His going forth is sure as the morning; and He shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that early passeth away.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of My mouth; and thy judgment goeth forth as the light.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than burnt-offerings.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> But they like men have transgressed the covenant; there have they dealt treacherously against Me.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, it is covered with footprints of blood.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so doth the company of priests; they murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they commit enormity.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing; there harlotry is found in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee! When I would turn the captivity of My people, <B>{P}</B></P>
