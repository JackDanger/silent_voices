<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Hosea Chapter 12</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Ephraim compasseth Me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; and Judah is yet wayward towards God, and towards the Holy One who is faithful.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Ephraim striveth after wind, and followeth after the east wind; all the day he multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways, according to his doings will He recompense him.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> In the womb he took his brother by the heel, and by his strength he strove with a godlike being;
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> So he strove with an angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him; at Beth-el he would find him, and there he would speak with us;
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> But the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD is His name.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Therefore turn thou to thy God; keep mercy and justice, and wait for thy God continually.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> As for the trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand. He loveth to oppress.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And Ephraim said: 'Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth; in all my labours they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> But I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed season.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> If Gilead be given to iniquity becoming altogether vanity, in Gilgal they sacrifice unto bullocks; yea, their altars shall be as heaps in the furrows of the field.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he kept.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Ephraim hath provoked most bitterly; therefore shall his blood be cast upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.</P>
