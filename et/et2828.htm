<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Proverbs Chapter 28</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are secure as a young lion.<BR>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof; but by a man of understanding and knowledge established order shall long continue.<BR>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> A poor man that oppresseth the weak is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> They that forsake the law praise the wicked; but such as keep the law contend with them.<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Evil men understand not justice; but they that seek the LORD understand all things.<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.<BR>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> A wise son observeth the teaching; but he that is a companion of gluttonous men shameth his father.<BR>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> He that augmenteth his substance by interest and increase, gathereth it for him that is gracious to the poor.<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination.<BR>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit; but the whole-hearted shall inherit good. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<P><B>11</B> The rich man is wise in his own eyes; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him through.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> When the righteous exult, there is great glory; but when the wicked rise, men must be sought for.<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy.<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Happy is the man that feareth alway; but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into evil.<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> As a roaring lion, and a ravenous bear; so is a wicked ruler over a poor people.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> The prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor; but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<P><B>17</B> A man that is laden with the blood of any person shall hasten his steps unto the pit; none will support him.<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved; but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> He that tilleth his ground shall have plenty of bread; but he that followeth after vain things shall have poverty enough.<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> A faithful man shall abound with blessings; but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished.<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> To have respect of persons is not good; for a man will transgress for a piece of bread.<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> He that hath an evil eye hasteneth after riches, and knoweth not that want shall come upon him.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> He that rebuketh a man shall in the end find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith: 'It is no transgression', the same is the companion of a destroyer.<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife; but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be abundantly gratified.<BR>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; but whoso walketh wisely, he shall escape.<BR>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack; but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.<BR>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; but when they perish, the righteous increase.</P>
