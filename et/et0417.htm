<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> 'Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the fire-pans out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are become holy;
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> even the fire-pans of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar--for they are become holy, because they were offered before the LORD--that they may be a sign unto the children of Israel.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And Eleazar the priest took the brazen fire-pans, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no common man, that is not of the seed of Aaron, draw near to burn incense before the LORD; that he fare not as Korah, and as his company; as the LORD spoke unto him by the hand of Moses. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<P><B>6</B> But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying: 'Ye have killed the people of the LORD.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting; and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> 'Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.' And they fell upon their faces.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And Moses said unto Aaron: 'Take thy fire-pan, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them; for there is wrath gone out from the LORD: the plague is begun.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people; and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tent of meeting, and the plague was stayed. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<P><B>16</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> 'Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods; thou shalt write every man's name upon his rod.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for the head of their fathers' houses.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall choose, his rod shall bud; and I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.'
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tent of the testimony.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel; and they looked, and took every man his rod. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<P><B>25</B> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept there, for a token against the rebellious children; that there may be made an end of their murmurings against Me, that they die not.'
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> Thus did Moses; as the LORD commanded him, so did he. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<P><B>27</B> And the children of Israel spoke unto Moses, saying: 'Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of the LORD, is to die; shall we wholly perish?' <B>{S}</B></P>
