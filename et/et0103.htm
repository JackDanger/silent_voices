<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Genesis Chapter 3</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman: 'Yea, hath God said: Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And the woman said unto the serpent: 'Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat;
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And the serpent said unto the woman: 'Ye shall not surely die;
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves girdles.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden toward the cool of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And the LORD God called unto the man, and said unto him: 'Where art thou?'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And he said: 'I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And He said: 'Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And the man said: 'The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And the LORD God said unto the woman: 'What is this thou hast done?' And the woman said: 'The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And the LORD God said unto the serpent: 'Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou from among all cattle, and from among all beasts of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; they shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise their heel.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Unto the woman He said: 'I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And unto Adam He said: 'Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying: Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<P><B>22</B> And the LORD God said: 'Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.'
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way to the tree of life. <B>{S}</B></P>
