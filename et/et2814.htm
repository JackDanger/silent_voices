<B>15</B> The thoughtless believeth every word; but the prudent man looketh well to his going.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>

<B>20</B> The poor is hated even of his own neighbour; but the rich hath many friends.<BR>

<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> A tranquil heart is the life of the flesh; but envy is the rottenness of the bones.<BR>
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> He that oppresseth the poor blasphemeth his Maker; but he that is gracious unto the needy honoureth Him.<BR>
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> The wicked is thrust down in his misfortune; but the righteous, even when he is brought to death, hath hope.<BR>
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> In the heart of him that hath discernment wisdom resteth; but in the inward part of fools it maketh itself known.<BR>

<A NAME="35"> </A>
