<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> <B>{S}</B> What profit hath he that worketh in that he laboureth?
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> I have seen the task which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> He hath made every thing beautiful in its time; also He hath set the world in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to get pleasure so long as they live.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> But also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy pleasure for all his labour, is the gift of God.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever; nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it; and God hath so made it, that men should fear before Him.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> That which is hath been long ago, and that which is to be hath already been; and God seeketh that which is pursued.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> I said in my heart: 'The righteous and the wicked God will judge; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> I said in my heart: 'It is because of the sons of men, that God may sift them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as beasts.'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that man hath no pre-eminence above a beast; for all is vanity.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all return to dust.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth?
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Wherefore I perceived that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</P>
