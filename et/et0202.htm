<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Exodus Chapter 2</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And the woman conceived, and bore a son; and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river's brink.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And she opened it, and saw it, even the child; and behold a boy that wept. And she had compassion on him, and said: 'This is one of the Hebrews' children.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter: 'Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Pharaoh's daughter said to her: 'Go.' And the maiden went and called the child's mother.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her: 'Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.' And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said: 'Because I drew him out of the water.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together; and he said to him that did the wrong: 'Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And he said: 'Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? thinkest thou to kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian?' And Moses feared, and said: 'Surely the thing is known.'
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And when they came to Reuel their father, he said: 'How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And they said: 'An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And he said unto his daughters: 'And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.'
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said: 'I have been a stranger in a strange land.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<P><B>23</B> And it came to pass in the course of those many days that the king of Egypt died; and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And God saw the children of Israel, and God took cognizance of them. <B>{S}</B></P>
