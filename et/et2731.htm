<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Job Chapter 31</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> I made a covenant with mine eyes; how then should I look upon a maid?<BR>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> For what would be the portion of God from above, and the heritage of the Almighty from on high?<BR>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity?<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Doth not He see my ways, and count all my steps?<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> If I have walked with vanity, and my foot hath hasted to deceit--<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Let me be weighed in a just balance, that God may know mine integrity--<BR>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> If my step hath turned out of the way, <B>{N}</B><BR>and my heart walked after mine eyes, and if any spot hath cleaved to my hands;<BR>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out.<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> If my heart have been enticed unto a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbour's door;<BR>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> For that were a heinous crime; yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> For it is a fire that consumeth unto destruction, and would root out all mine increase.<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> If I did despise the cause of my man-servant, or of my maid-servant, when they contended with me--<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> What then shall I do when God riseth up? And when He remembereth, what shall I answer Him?<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Did not He that made me in the womb make him? And did not One fashion us in the womb?<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> If I have withheld aught that the poor desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof--<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, and I have been her guide from my mother's womb.<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> If I have seen any wanderer in want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering;<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate;<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> For calamity from God was a terror to me, and by reason of His majesty I could do nothing.<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold: 'Thou art my confidence';<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much;<BR>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;<BR>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And my heart hath been secretly enticed, and my mouth hath kissed my hand;<BR>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges; for I should have lied to God that is above.<BR>
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or exulted when evil found him--<BR>
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> Yea, I suffered not my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse.<BR>
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> If the men of my tent said not: 'Who can find one that hath not been satisfied with his meat?'<BR>
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> The stranger did not lodge in the street; my doors I opened to the roadside.<BR>
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> If after the manner of men I covered my transgressions, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom--<BR>
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> Because I feared the great multitude, and the most contemptible among families terrified me, <B>{N}</B><BR>so that I kept silence, and went not out of the door.<BR>
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> Oh that I had one to hear me!--Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me-- <B>{N}</B><BR>and that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written!<BR>
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown.<BR>
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.<BR>
<A NAME="38"> </A>
<B>38</B> If my land cry out against me, and the furrows thereof weep together;<BR>
<A NAME="39"> </A>
<B>39</B> If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the tillers thereof to be disappointed--<BR>
<A NAME="40"> </A>
<B>40</B> Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and noisome weeds instead of barley. The words of Job are ended. <B>{P}</B></P>
