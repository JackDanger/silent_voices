<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Jeremiah Chapter 14</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the droughts.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they bow down in black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And their nobles send their lads for water: they come to the pits, and find no water; their vessels return empty; they are ashamed and confounded, and cover their heads.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Because of the ground which is cracked, for there hath been no rain in the land, the plowmen are ashamed, they cover their heads.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Yea, the hind also in the field calveth, and forsaketh her young, because there is no grass,
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And the wild asses stand on the high hills, they gasp for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Though our iniquities testify against us, O LORD, work Thou for Thy name's sake; for our backslidings are many, we have sinned against Thee.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> O Thou hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest Thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Why shouldest thou be as a man overcome, as a mighty man that cannot save? Yet Thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and Thy name is called upon us; leave us not. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Thus saith the LORD unto this people: Even so have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet; therefore the LORD doth not accept them, now will He remember their iniquity, and punish their sins. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<P><B>11</B> And the LORD said unto me: 'Pray not for this people for their good.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Then said I: 'Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them: Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Then the LORD said unto me: 'The prophets prophesy lies in My name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke I unto them; they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own heart. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Therefore thus saith the LORD: As for the prophets that prophesy in My name, and I sent them not, yet they say: Sword and famine shall not be in this land, by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed;
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters; for I will pour their evil upon them.'
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And thou shalt say this word unto them: Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! And if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! For both the prophet and the priest are gone about to a land, and knew it not. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah? Hath Thy soul loathed Zion? Why hast Thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold terror!
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, even the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against Thee.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Do not contemn us, for Thy name's sake, do not dishonour the throne of Thy glory; remember, break not Thy covenant with us.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? Art not Thou He, O LORD our God, and do we not wait for Thee? For Thou hast made all these things. <B>{P}</B></P>
