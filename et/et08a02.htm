<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">1 Samuel Chapter 2</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And Hannah prayed, and said: my heart exulteth in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD; my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in Thy salvation.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> There is none holy as the LORD, for there is none beside Thee; neither is there any rock like our God.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Multiply not exceeding proud talk; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth; for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry have ceased; while the barren hath borne seven, she that had many children hath languished.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> The LORD killeth, and maketh alive; He bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich; He bringeth low, He also lifteth up.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, He lifteth up the needy from the dung-hill, to make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory; for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and He hath set the world upon them.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> He will keep the feet of His holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for not by strength shall man prevail.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> They that strive with the LORD shall be broken to pieces; against them will He thunder in heaven; the LORD will judge the ends of the earth; and He will give strength unto His king, and exalt the horn of His anointed. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<P><B>11</B> And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not the LORD.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his band;
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did unto all the Israelites that came thither in Shiloh.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Yea, before the fat was made to smoke, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed: 'Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.'
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And if the man said unto him: 'Let the fat be made to smoke first of all, and then take as much as thy soul desireth'; then he would say: 'Nay, but thou shalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force.'
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD; for the men dealt contemptuously with the offering of the LORD.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say: 'The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to the LORD.' And they would go unto their own home.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> So the LORD remembered Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And he said unto them: 'Why do ye such things? for I hear evil reports concerning you from all this people.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report which I hear the LORD'S people do spread abroad.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him?' But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favour both with the LORD, and also with men. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<P><B>27</B> And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him: 'Thus saith the LORD: Did I reveal Myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house?
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up unto Mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> Wherefore kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine offering, which I have commanded in My habitation; and honourest thy sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel My people?
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, saith: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before Me for ever; but now the LORD saith: Be it far from Me: for them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> And thou shalt behold a rival in My habitation, in all the good which shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> Yet will I not cut off every man of thine from Mine altar, to make thine eyes to fail, and thy heart to languish; and all the increase of thy house shall die young men.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> And this shall be the sign unto thee, that which shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> And I will raise Me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in My heart and in My mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before Mine anointed for ever.
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say: Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.' <B>{P}</B></P>
