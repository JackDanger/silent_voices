<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Exodus Chapter 23</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Thou shalt not utter a false report; put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou bear witness in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to pervert justice;
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> neither shalt thou favour a poor man in his cause. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under its burden, thou shalt forbear to pass by him; thou shalt surely release it with him. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not; for I will not justify the wicked.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And thou shalt take no gift; for a gift blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And a stranger shalt thou not oppress; for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and gather in the increase thereof;
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of thy people may eat; and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Six days thou shalt do thy work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed; and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto Me in the year.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep; seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib--for in it thou camest out from Egypt; and none shall appear before Me empty;
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labours, which thou sowest in the field; and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labours out of the field.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of My feast remain all night until the morning.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> The choicest first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<P><B>20</B> Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Take heed of him, and hearken unto his voice; be not rebellious against him; for he will not pardon your transgression; for My name is in him.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> For Mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their doings; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and He will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> None shall miscarry, nor be barren, in thy land; the number of thy days I will fulfil.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> I will send My terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> They shall not dwell in thy land--lest they make thee sin against Me, for thou wilt serve their gods--for they will be a snare unto thee. <B>{P}</B></P>
