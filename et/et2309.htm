<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> The burden of the word of the LORD. In the land of Hadrach, and in Damascus shall be His resting-place; for the LORD'S is the eye of man and all the tribes of Israel.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And Hamath also shall border thereon; Tyre and Zidon, for she is very wise.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Behold, the Lord will impoverish her, and He will smite her power into the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Ashkelon shall see it, and fear, Gaza also, and shall be sore pained, and Ekron, for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his detestable things from between his teeth, and he also shall be a remnant for our God; and he shall be as a chief in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And I will encamp about My house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more; for now have I seen with Mine eyes. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion, shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy king cometh unto thee, he is triumphant, and victorious, lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall speak peace unto the nations; and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I send forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Return to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope; even to-day do I declare that I will render double unto thee.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> For I bend Judah for Me, I fill the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Javan, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And the LORD shall be seen over them, and His arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord GOD will blow the horn, and will go with whirlwinds of the south.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> The LORD of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like the basins, like the corners of the altar.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of His people; for they shall be as the stones of a crown, glittering over His land.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> For how great is their goodness, and how great is their beauty! Corn shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the maids.</P>
