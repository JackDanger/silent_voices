<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: I am the LORD your God.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do; and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their statutes.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Mine ordinances shall ye do, and My statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Ye shall therefore keep My statutes, and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them: I am the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness. I am the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> The nakedness of thy father, and the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover; for theirs is thine own nakedness. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister; for she is thy mother's near kinswoman. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy son' wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness: they are near kinswomen; it is lewdness.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And thou shalt not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her lifetime.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to set them apart to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind; it is abomination.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto; it is perversion.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things; for in all these the nations are defiled, which I cast out from before you.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And the land was defiled, therefore I did visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomited out her inhabitants.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> Ye therefore shall keep My statutes and Mine ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the home-born, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you--
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you, and the land is defiled--
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> Therefore shall ye keep My charge, that ye do not any of these abominable customs, which were done before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God. <B>{P}</B></P>
