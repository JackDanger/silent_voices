<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Isaiah Chapter 44</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Yet now hear, O Jacob My servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen;
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, who will help thee: Fear not, O Jacob My servant, and thou, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> For I will pour water upon the thirsty land, and streams upon the dry ground; I will pour My spirit upon thy seed, and My blessing upon thine offspring;
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And they shall spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> One shall say: 'I am the LORD'S'; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<P><B>6</B> Thus saith the LORD, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer the LORD of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last, and beside Me there is no God.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And who, as I, can proclaim--let him declare it, and set it in order for Me--since I appointed the ancient people? And the things that are coming, and that shall come to pass, let them declare.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Fear ye not, neither be afraid; have I not announced unto thee of old, and declared it? And ye are My witnesses. Is there a God beside Me? Yea, there is no Rock; I know not any.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> They that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity, and their delectable things shall not profit; and their own witnesses see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Who hath fashioned a god, or molten an image that is profitable for nothing?
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Behold, all the fellows thereof shall be ashamed; and the craftsmen skilled above men; let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; they shall fear, they shall be ashamed together.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> The smith maketh an axe, and worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with his strong arm; yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth; he drinketh no water, and is faint.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> The carpenter stretcheth out a line; he marketh it out with a pencil; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compasses, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to dwell in the house.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the ilex and the oak, and strengtheneth for himself one among the trees of the forest; he planteth a bay-tree, and the rain doth nourish it.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Then a man useth it for fuel; and he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> He burneth the half thereof in the fire; with the half thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied; yea, he warmeth himself, and saith: 'Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire';
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image; he falleth down unto it and worshippeth, and prayeth unto it, and saith: 'Deliver me, for thou art my god.'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> They know not, neither do they understand; for their eyes are bedaubed, that they cannot see, and their hearts, that they cannot understand.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say: 'I have burned the half of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh and eaten it; and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? Shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> He striveth after ashes, a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say: 'Is there not a lie in my right hand?' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel, for thou art My servant; I have formed thee, thou art Mine own servant; O Israel, thou shouldest not forget Me.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins; return unto Me, for I have redeemed thee.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> Sing, O ye heavens, for the LORD hath done it; shout, ye lowest parts of the earth; break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein; for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and doth glorify Himself in Israel. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, and He that formed thee from the womb: I am the LORD, that maketh all things; that stretched forth the heavens alone; that spread abroad the earth by Myself;
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> That frustrateth the tokens of the imposters, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> That confirmeth the word of His servant, and performeth the counsel of His messengers; that saith of Jerusalem: 'She shall be inhabited'; and of the cities of Judah: 'They shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places thereof';
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> That saith to the deep: 'Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers';
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> That saith of Cyrus: 'He is My shepherd, and shall perform all My pleasure'; even saying of Jerusalem: 'She shall be built'; and to the temple: 'My foundation shall be laid.' <B>{P}</B></P>
