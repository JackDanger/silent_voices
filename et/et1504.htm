<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, that oppress the poor, that crush the needy, that say unto their lords: 'Bring, that we may feast.'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> The Lord GOD hath sworn by His holiness: Lo, surely the days shall come upon you, that ye shall be taken away with hooks, and your residue with fish-hooks.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And ye shall go out at the breaches, every one straight before her; and ye shall be cast into Harmon, saith the LORD.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Come to Beth-el, and transgress, to Gilgal, and multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices in the morning, and your tithes after three days;
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill-offerings and publish them; for so ye love to do, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places; yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith the LORD.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And I also have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest; and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city; one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> So two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water, and were not satisfied; yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith the LORD.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> I have smitten you with blasting and mildew; the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig-trees and your olive-trees hath the palmer-worm devoured; yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> I have sent among you the pestilence in the way of Egypt; your young men have I slain with the sword, and have carried away your horses; and I have made the stench of your camp to come up even into your nostrils; yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith the LORD.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a brand plucked out of the burning; yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith the LORD.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel; because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> For, lo, He that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth; the LORD, the God of hosts, is His name. <B>{P}</B></P>
