<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Genesis Chapter 44</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And he commanded the steward of his house, saying: 'Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And put my goblet, the silver goblet, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money.' And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward: 'Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them: Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these words.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And they said unto him: 'Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought back unto thee out of the land of Canaan; how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And he said: 'Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Then they hastened, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And he searched, beginning at the eldest, and leaving off at the youngest; and the goblet was found in Benjamin's sack.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, and he was yet there; and they fell before him on the ground.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And Joseph said unto them: 'What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I will indeed divine?'
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And Judah said: 'What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.'
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And he said: 'Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the goblet is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Then Judah came near unto him, and said: 'Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> My lord asked his servants, saying: Have ye a father, or a brother?
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And we said unto my lord: We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And thou saidst unto thy servants: Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And we said unto my lord: The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And thou saidst unto thy servants: Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And our father said: Go again, buy us a little food.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And we said: We cannot go down; if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And thy servant my father said unto us: Ye know that my wife bore me two sons;
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> and the one went out from me, and I said: Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since;
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his soul is bound up with the lad's soul;
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die; and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying: If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I look upon the evil that shall come on my father.'</P>
