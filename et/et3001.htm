<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Song of Songs Chapter 1</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> The song of songs, which is Solomon's.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth--for thy love is better than wine.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Thine ointments have a goodly fragrance; thy name is as ointment poured forth; therefore do the maidens love thee.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Draw me, we will run after thee; the king hath brought me into his chambers; we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will find thy love more fragrant than wine! sincerely do they love thee. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<P><B>5</B> 'I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Look not upon me, that I am swarthy, that the sun hath tanned me; my mother's sons were incensed against me, they made me keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon; for why should I be as one that veileth herself beside the flocks of thy companions?
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed thy kids, beside the shepherds' tents. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<P><B>9</B> I have compared thee, O my love, to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Thy cheeks are comely with circlets, thy neck with beads.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> We will make thee circlets of gold with studs of silver.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> While the king sat at his table, my spikenard sent forth its fragrance.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> My beloved is unto me as a bag of myrrh, that lieth betwixt my breasts.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna in the vineyards of En-gedi. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are as doves.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant; also our couch is leafy.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> The beams of our houses are cedars, and our panels are cypresses.</P>
