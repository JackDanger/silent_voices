<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> 'Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for Me an offering; of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take My offering.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And this is the offering which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and brass;
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair;
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia-wood;
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense;
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> According to all that I show thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And they shall make an ark of acacia-wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof; and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And thou shalt make staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And thou shalt put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, wherewith to bear the ark.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> The staves shall be in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken from it.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And thou shalt make an ark-cover of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the ark-cover.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end; of one piece with the ark-cover shall ye make the cherubim of the two ends thereof.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, screening the ark-cover with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the ark-cover shall the faces of the cherubim be.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And thou shalt put the ark-cover above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<P><B>23</B> And thou shalt make a table of acacia-wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And thou shalt make unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> Close by the border shall the rings be, for places for the staves to bear the table.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And thou shalt make the staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and the pans thereof, and the jars thereof, and the bowls thereof, wherewith to pour out; of pure gold shalt thou make them.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And thou shalt set upon the table showbread before Me alway. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<P><B>31</B> And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> And there shall be six branches going out of the sides thereof: three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candle-stick out of the other side thereof;
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower; so for the six branches going out of the candlestick.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> And in the candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof.
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> And a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the candlestick.
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> Their knops and their branches shall be of one piece with it; the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold.
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> And thou shalt make the lamps thereof, seven; and they shall light the lamps thereof, to give light over against it.
<A NAME="38"> </A>
<B>38</B> And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold.
<A NAME="39"> </A>
<B>39</B> Of a talent of pure gold shall it be made, with all these vessels.
<A NAME="40"> </A>
<B>40</B> And see that thou make them after their pattern, which is being shown thee in the mount. <B>{S}</B></P>
