<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. And Laban departed, and returned unto his place.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And Jacob said when he saw them: 'This is God's camp.' And he called the name of that place Mahanaim. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<P><B>4</B> And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And he commanded them, saying: 'Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And I have oxen, and asses and flocks, and men-servants and maid-servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: 'We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. And he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two camps.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And he said: 'If Esau come to the one camp, and smite it, then the camp which is left shall escape.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And Jacob said: 'O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who saidst unto me: Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good;
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> I am not worthy of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which Thou hast shown unto Thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two camps.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And Thou saidst: I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And he lodged there that night; and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> thirty milch camels and their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and said unto his servants: 'Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And he commanded the foremost, saying: 'When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying: Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> then thou shalt say: They are thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord, even unto Esau; and, behold, he also is behind us.'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: 'In this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> and ye shall say: Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.' For he said: 'I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.'
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> So the present passed over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And he said: 'Let me go, for the day breaketh.' And he said: 'I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.'
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And he said unto him: 'What is thy name?' And he said: 'Jacob.'
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And he said: 'Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.'
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.' And he said: 'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?' And he blessed him there.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: 'for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.'
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh.
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the thigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, even in the sinew of the thigh-vein.</P>
