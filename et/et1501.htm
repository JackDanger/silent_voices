<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Amos Chapter 1</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And he said: the LORD roareth from Zion, and uttereth His voice from Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<P><B>3</B> For thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Damascus, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they have threshed Gilead with sledges of iron.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> So will I send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad;
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from Bikath-Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Beth-eden; and the people of Aram shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<P><B>6</B> Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Gaza, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they carried away captive a whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> So will I send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the palaces thereof;
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon; and I will turn My hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<P><B>9</B> Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Tyre, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they delivered up a whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> So will I send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the palaces thereof. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<P><B>11</B> Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Edom, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> So will I send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<P><B>13</B> Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> So will I kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
