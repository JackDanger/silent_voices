<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Genesis Chapter 2</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it He rested from all His work which God in creating had made. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<P><B>4</B> These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> No shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground;
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And the LORD God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> and the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And the name of the third river is Tigris; that is it which goeth toward the east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And the LORD God commanded the man, saying: 'Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat;
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And the LORD God said: 'It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man would call every living creature, that was to be the name thereof.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the place with flesh instead thereof.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from the man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And the man said: 'This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.'
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</P>
