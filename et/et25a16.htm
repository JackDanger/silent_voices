<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a cake made in a pan, and a sweet cake.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to celebrate and to thank and praise the LORD, the God of Israel: <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto the LORD, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<P><B>8</B> O give thanks unto the LORD, call upon His name; make known His doings among the peoples.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Sing unto Him, sing praises unto Him; speak ye of all His marvellous works.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Glory ye in His holy name; let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Seek ye the LORD and His strength; seek His face continually.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Remember His marvellous works that He hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth;
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> O ye seed of Israel His servant, ye children of Jacob, His chosen ones.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Remember His covenant for ever, the word which He commanded to a thousand generations;
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> [The covenant] which He made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac;
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And He established it unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant;
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Saying: 'Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance.'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> When ye were but a few men in number, yea, very few, and sojourners in it,
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And when they went about from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people,
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> He suffered no man to do them wrong, yea, for their sake He reproved kings:
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> 'Touch not Mine anointed ones, and do My prophets no harm.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<P><B>23</B> Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; proclaim His salvation from day to day.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Declare His glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> For great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; He also is to be feared above all gods.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> For all the gods of the peoples are things of nought; but the LORD made the heavens.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> Honour and majesty are before Him; strength and gladness are in His place.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> Ascribe unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the peoples, ascribe unto the LORD glory and strength.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> Ascribe unto the LORD the glory due unto His name; bring an offering, and come before Him; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> Tremble before Him, all the earth; the world also is established that it cannot be moved.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; and let them say among the nations: 'The LORD reigneth.'
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; let the field exult, and all that is therein;
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy, before the LORD, for He is come to judge the earth.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> O give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> And say ye: 'Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks unto Thy holy name, that we may triumph in Thy praise.'
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said: 'Amen,' and praised the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<P><B>37</B> So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required;
<A NAME="38"> </A>
<B>38</B> and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; <B>{S}</B> Obed-edom also the son of Jedithun and Hosah to be door-keepers;
<A NAME="39"> </A>
<B>39</B> and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,
<A NAME="40"> </A>
<B>40</B> to offer burnt-offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the Law of the LORD, which He commanded unto Israel;
<A NAME="41"> </A>
<B>41</B> and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because His mercy endureth for ever;
<A NAME="42"> </A>
<B>42</B> and with them Heman and Jeduthun, to sound aloud with trumpets and cymbals, and with instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.
<A NAME="43"> </A>
<B>43</B> And all the people departed every man to his house; and David returned to bless his house. <B>{P}</B></P>
