<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Judges Chapter 19</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem in Judah.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Beth-lehem in Judah, and was there the space of four months.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly unto her, to bring her back, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses; and she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days; so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart; and the damsel's father said unto his son-in-law: 'Stay thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together; and the damsel's father said unto the man: 'Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said: 'Stay thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth'; and they did eat, both of them.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said unto him: 'Behold, now the day draweth toward evening; tarry, I pray you, all night; behold, the day groweth to an end; lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus--the same is Jerusalem; and there were with him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> When they were by Jebus--the day was far spent--the servant said unto his master: 'Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And his master said unto him: 'We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And he said unto his servant: 'Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah; and he went in, and sat him down in the broad place of the city; for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even; now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the broad place of the city; and the old man said: 'Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And he said unto him: 'We are passing from Beth-lehem in Judah unto the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem in Judah, and I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that taketh me into his house.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man that is with thy servants; there is no want of any thing.'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And the old man said: 'Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the broad place.'
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder; and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying: 'Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.'
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them: 'Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this wanton deed.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; I will bring them out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you; but unto this man do not so wanton a thing.'
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> But the men would not hearken to him; so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning; and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And he said unto her. 'Up, and let us be going'; but none answered; then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and got him unto his place.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And it was so, that all that saw it said: 'Such a thing hath not happened nor been seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak.' <B>{P}</B></P>
