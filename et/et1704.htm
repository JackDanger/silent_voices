<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Jonah Chapter 4</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And he prayed unto the LORD, and said: 'I pray Thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in mine own country? Therefore I fled beforehand unto Tarshish; for I knew that Thou art a gracious God, and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy, and repentest Thee of the evil.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech Thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And the LORD said: 'Art thou greatly angry?'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his evil. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said: 'It is better for me to die than to live.'
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And God said to Jonah: 'Art thou greatly angry for the gourd?' And he said: 'I am greatly angry, even unto death.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And the LORD said: 'Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow, which came up in a night, and perished in a night;
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?' <B>{P}</B></P>
