<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of His wrath.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness and not in light.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Surely against me He turneth His hand again and again all the day. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> My flesh and my skin hath He worn out; He hath broken my bones.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> He hath hedged me about, that I cannot go forth; He hath made my chain heavy.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Yea, when I cry and call for help, He shutteth out my prayer.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> He hath enclosed my ways with hewn stone, He hath made my paths crooked. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; He hath made me desolate.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> He hath bent His bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> He hath caused the arrows of His quiver to enter into my reins.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> He hath filled me with bitterness, He hath sated me with wormwood. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, He hath made me to wallow in ashes.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And my soul is removed far off from peace, I forgot prosperity.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And I said: 'My strength is perished, and mine expectation from the LORD.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Remember mine affliction and mine anguish, the wormwood and the gall.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Surely the LORD'S mercies are not consumed, surely His compassions fail not.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> They are new every morning; great is Thy faithfulness.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> 'The LORD is my portion', saith my soul; 'Therefore will I hope in Him.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> The LORD is good unto them that wait for Him, to the soul that seeketh Him.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> It is good that a man should quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> Let him sit alone and keep silence, because He hath laid it upon him.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him, let him be filled full with reproach. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> For the Lord will not cast off for ever.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> For though He cause grief, yet will He have compassion according to the multitude of His mercies.
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> For He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?
<A NAME="38"> </A>
<B>38</B> Out of the mouth of the Most High proceedeth not evil and good?
<A NAME="39"> </A>
<B>39</B> Wherefore doth a living man complain, a strong man because of his sins? <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="40"> </A>
<B>40</B> Let us search and try our ways, and return to the LORD.
<A NAME="41"> </A>
<B>41</B> Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.
<A NAME="42"> </A>
<B>42</B> We have transgressed and have rebelled; Thou hast not pardoned. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="43"> </A>
<B>43</B> Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; Thou hast slain unsparingly.
<A NAME="44"> </A>
<B>44</B> Thou hast covered Thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.
<A NAME="45"> </A>
<B>45</B> Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="46"> </A>
<B>46</B> All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.
<A NAME="47"> </A>
<B>47</B> Terror and the pit are come upon us, desolation and destruction.
<A NAME="48"> </A>
<B>48</B> Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water, for the breach of the daughter of my people. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="49"> </A>
<B>49</B> Mine eye is poured out, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
<A NAME="50"> </A>
<B>50</B> Till the LORD look forth, and behold from heaven.
<A NAME="51"> </A>
<B>51</B> Mine eye affected my soul, because of all the daughters of my city. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="52"> </A>
<B>52</B> They have chased me sore like a bird, that are mine enemies without cause.
<A NAME="53"> </A>
<B>53</B> They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast stones upon me.
<A NAME="54"> </A>
<B>54</B> Waters flowed over my head; I said: 'I am cut off.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="55"> </A>
<B>55</B> I called upon Thy name, O LORD, Out of the lowest dungeon.
<A NAME="56"> </A>
<B>56</B> Thou heardest my voice; hide not Thine ear at my sighing, at my cry.
<A NAME="57"> </A>
<B>57</B> Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon Thee; Thou saidst: 'Fear not.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="58"> </A>
<B>58</B> O Lord, Thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; Thou hast redeemed my life.
<A NAME="59"> </A>
<B>59</B> O LORD, Thou hast seen my wrong; judge Thou my cause.
<A NAME="60"> </A>
<B>60</B> Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="61"> </A>
<B>61</B> Thou hast heard their taunt, O LORD, and all their devices against me;
<A NAME="62"> </A>
<B>62</B> The lips of those that rose up against me, and their muttering against me all the day.
<A NAME="63"> </A>
<B>63</B> Behold Thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="64"> </A>
<B>64</B> Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.
<A NAME="65"> </A>
<B>65</B> Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, Thy curse unto them.
<A NAME="66"> </A>
<B>66</B> Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
