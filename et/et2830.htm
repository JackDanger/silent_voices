<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Proverbs Chapter 30</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the burden. The man saith unto Ithiel, unto Ithiel and Ucal:<BR>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Surely I am brutish, unlike a man, and have not the understanding of a man;<BR>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And I have not learned wisdom, that I should have the knowledge of the Holy One.<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended? <B>{N}</B><BR>Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound the waters in his garment? <B>{N}</B><BR>Who hath established all the ends of the earth? <B>{N}</B><BR>What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou knowest?<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Every word of God is tried; He is a shield unto them that take refuge in Him.<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Add thou not unto His words, lest He reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<P><B>7</B> Two things have I asked of Thee; deny me them not before I die:<BR>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Remove far from me falsehood and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; <B>{N}</B><BR>feed me with mine allotted bread;<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Lest I be full, and deny, and say: 'Who is the LORD?' <B>{N}</B><BR>Or lest I be poor, and steal, and profane the name of my God. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<P><B>10</B> Slander not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> There is a generation that curse their father, and do not bless their mother.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness.<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> There is a generation, Oh how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> There is a generation whose teeth are as swords, and their great teeth as knives, <B>{N}</B><BR>to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> The horseleech hath two daughters: 'Give, give.' <B>{N}</B><BR>There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four that say not: 'Enough':<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not satisfied with water; and the fire that saith not: 'Enough.'<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, <B>{N}</B><BR>the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young vultures shall eat it. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<P><B>18</B> There are three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; <B>{N}</B><BR>the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a young woman.<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> So is the way of an adulterous woman; <B>{N}</B><BR>she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith: 'I have done no wickedness.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<P><B>21</B> For three things the earth doth quake, and for four it cannot endure:<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> For a servant when he reigneth; and a churl when he is filled with food;<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> For an odious woman when she is married; and a handmaid that is heir to her mistress. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<P><B>24</B> There are four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> The ants are a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer;<BR>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> The rock-badgers are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the crags;<BR>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;<BR>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> The spider thou canst take with the hands, yet is she in kings' palaces. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<P><B>29</B> There are three things which are stately in their march, yea, four which are stately in going:<BR>
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> The lion, which is mightiest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;<BR>
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> The greyhound; the he-goat also; and the king, against whom there is no rising up.<BR>
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast planned devices, lay thy hand upon thy mouth.<BR>
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> For the churning of milk bringeth forth curd, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood; <B>{N}</B><BR>so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="34"> </A>
