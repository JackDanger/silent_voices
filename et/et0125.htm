<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And Jokshan begot Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth; there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<P><B>12</B> Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore unto Abraham.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa;
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedem;
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years; and he expired and died; and was gathered unto his people.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Asshur: over against all his brethren he did settle. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<P><B>19</B> And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begot Isaac.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD let Himself be entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And the children struggled together within her; and she said: 'If it be so, wherefore do I live?' And she went to inquire of the LORD.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And the LORD said unto her: Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And the first came forth ruddy, all over like a hairy mantle; and they called his name Esau.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bore them.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And the boys grew; and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison; and Rebekah loved Jacob.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And Jacob sod pottage; and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And Esau said to Jacob: 'Let me swallow, I pray thee, some of this red, red pottage; for I am faint.' Therefore was his name called Edom.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> And Jacob said: 'Sell me first thy birthright.'
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> And Esau said: 'Behold, I am at the point to die; and what profit shall the birthright do to me?'
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> And Jacob said: 'Swear to me first'; and he swore unto him; and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright. <B>{P}</B></P>
