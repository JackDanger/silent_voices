<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil; thy hair is as a flock of goats, that trail down from mount Gilead.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes all shaped alike, which are come up from the washing; whereof all are paired, and none faileth among them.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy mouth is comely; thy temples are like a pomegranate split open behind thy veil.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Thy neck is like the tower of David builded with turrets, whereon there hang a thousand shields, all the armour of the mighty men.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a gazelle, which feed among the lilies.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Until the day breathe, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Thou art all fair, my love; and there is no spot in thee. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon; look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one bead of thy necklace.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all manner of spices!
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Thy lips, O my bride, drop honey--honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> A garden shut up is my sister, my bride; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Thy shoots are a park of pomegranates, with precious fruits; henna with spikenard plants,
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Thou art a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and flowing streams from Lebanon.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his precious fruits.</P>
