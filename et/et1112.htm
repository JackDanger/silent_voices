<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Jeremiah Chapter 12</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Right wouldest Thou be, O LORD, were I to contend with Thee, yet will I reason with Thee: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? Wherefore are all they secure that deal very treacherously?
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit; Thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> But Thou, O LORD, knowest me, Thou seest me, and triest my heart toward Thee; pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<P><B>4</B> How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole field wither? For the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said: 'He seeth not our end.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> 'If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? And though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the thickets of the Jordan?
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee, even they have cried aloud after thee; believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> I have forsaken My house, I have cast off My heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of My soul into the hand of her enemies.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> My heritage is become unto Me as a lion in the forest; she hath uttered her voice against Me; therefore have I hated her.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Is My heritage unto Me as a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her round about? Come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard, they have trodden My portion under foot, they have made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> They have made it a desolation, it mourneth unto Me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Upon all the high hills in the wilderness spoilers are come; for the sword of the LORD devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land, no flesh hath peace. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, they profit not; be ye then ashamed of your increase, because of the fierce anger of the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<P><B>14</B> Thus saith the LORD: As for all Mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit, behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them; and I will bring them back, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of My people to swear by My name: 'As the LORD liveth,' even as they taught My people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of My people.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> But if they will not hearken, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, saith the LORD. <B>{S}</B></P>
