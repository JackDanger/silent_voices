<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> The LORD hath made every things for His own purpose, yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD; my hand upon it! he shall not be unpunished.<BR>

<B>10</B> A divine sentence is in the lips of the king; his mouth trespasseth not in judgment.<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> A just balance and scales are the LORD'S; all the weights of the bag are His work.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness; for the throne is established by righteousness.<BR>

<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> The wrath of a king is as messengers of death; but a wise man will pacify it.<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver.<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil; he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the humble, than to divide the spoil with the proud.<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> He that giveth heed unto the word shall find good; and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> The wise in heart is called a man of discernment; and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Understanding is a fountain of life unto him that hath it; but folly is the chastisement of fools.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<BR>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> The hunger of the labouring man laboureth for him; for his mouth compelleth him.<BR>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> An ungodly man diggeth up evil, and in his lips there is as a burning fire.<BR>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> A froward man soweth strife; and a whisperer separateth familiar friends.<BR>
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> A man of violence enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into a way that is not good.<BR>
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> He that shutteth his eyes, it is to devise froward things; he that biteth his lips bringeth evil to pass.<BR>
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> The hoary head is a crown of glory, it is found in the way of righteousness.<BR>
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.<BR>
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.</P>
