<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Hosea Chapter 4</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel! for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Swearing and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery! they break all bounds, and blood toucheth blood.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Therefore doth the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein doth languish, with the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also are taken away.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Therefore shalt thou stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to Me; seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> The more they were increased, the more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> They feed on the sin of My people, and set their heart on their iniquity.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And it is like people, like priest; and I will punish him for his ways, and will recompense him his doings.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And they shall eat, and not have enough, they shall commit harlotry, and shall not increase; because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Harlotry, wine, and new wine take away the heart.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of harlotry hath caused them to err, and they have gone astray from under their God.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and offer upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good; therefore your daughters commit harlotry, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery; for they themselves consort with lewd women, and they sacrifice with harlots; and the people that is without understanding is distraught.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah become guilty; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear: 'As the LORD liveth.'
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> For Israel is stubborn like a stubborn heifer; now shall the LORD feed them as a lamb in a large place?
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> When their carouse is over, they take to harlotry; her rulers deeply love dishonour.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> The wind hath bound her up in her skirts; and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices. <B>{P}</B></P>
