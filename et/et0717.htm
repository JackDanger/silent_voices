<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Judges Chapter 17</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Now there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And he said unto his mother: 'The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.' And his mother said: 'Blessed be my son of the LORD.'
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said: 'I verily dedicate the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore I will restore it unto thee.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image; and it was in the house of Micah.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And the man Micah had a house of God, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<P><B>7</B> And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem in Judah--in the family of Judah--who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem in Judah, to sojourn where he could find a place; and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And Micah said unto him: 'Whence comest thou?' And he said unto him: 'I am a Levite of Beth-lehem in Judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And Micah said unto him: 'Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.' So the Levite went in.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Then said Micah: 'Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite as my priest.' <B>{P}</B></P>
