<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And I said unto the angel that spoke with me: 'What are these?' And he said unto me: 'These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Then said I: 'What come these to do?' And he spoke, saying: 'These--the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head--these then are come to frighten them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Then said I: 'Whither goest thou?' And he said unto me: 'To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And, behold, the angel that spoke with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> and said unto him: 'Run, speak to this young man, saying: 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<P><B>10</B> Ho, ho, flee then from the land of the north, saith the LORD; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Ho, Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> For thus saith the LORD of hosts who sent me after glory unto the nations which spoiled you: 'Surely, he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> For, behold, I will shake My hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them'; and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> 'Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be My people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee'; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And the LORD shall inherit Judah as His portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused out of His holy habitation. <B>{S}</B></P>
