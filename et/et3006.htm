<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> 'Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? Whither hath thy beloved turned him, that we may seek him with thee?'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> 'My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine, that feedeth among the lilies.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that trail down from Gilead.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, which are come up from the washing; whereof all are paired, and none faileth among them.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Thy temples are like a pomegranate split open behind thy veil.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and maidens without number.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother; she is the choice one of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her happy; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Who is she that looketh forth as the dawn, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, terrible as an army with banners? <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> I went down into the garden of nuts, to look at the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded, and the pomegranates were in flower.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Before I was aware, my soul set me upon the chariots of my princely people.</P>
