<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Daniel Chapter 8</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the castle, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the stream Ulai.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the stream a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the stream, and ran at him in the fury of his power.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly; and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up the appearance of four horns toward the four winds of heaven.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauteous land.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and from him the continual burnt-offering was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt-offering through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it wrought, and prospered.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spoke: 'How long shall be the vision concerning the continual burnt-offering, and the transgression that causes appalment, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled under foot?'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And he said unto me: 'Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be victorious.'
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of Ulai, who called, and said: 'Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.'
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was terrified, and fell upon my face; but he said unto me: 'Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And he said: 'Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> The ram which thou sawest having the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have completed their transgression, there shall stand up a king of fierce countenance, and understanding stratagems.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do; and he shall destroy them that are mighty and the people of the saints.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And through his cunning he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in time of security shall he destroy many; he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true; but thou, shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come.'
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was appalled at the vision, but understood it not. <B>{P}</B></P>
