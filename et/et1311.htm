<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> The more they called them, the more they went from them; they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and offered to graven images.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And I, I taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I fed them gently.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And the sword shall fall upon his cities, and shall consume his bars, and devour them, because of their own counsels.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And My people are in suspense about returning to Me; and though they call them upwards, none at all will lift himself up.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I surrender thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned within Me, My compassions are kindled together.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> I will not execute the fierceness of Mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim; for I am God, and not man, the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in fury.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> They shall walk after the LORD, who shall roar like a lion; for He shall roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith the LORD. <B>{S}</B></P>
