<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Now the LORD said unto Abram: 'Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse; and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> So Abram went, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him; and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the terebinth of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said: 'Unto thy seed will I give this land'; and he builded there an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east; and he builded there an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<P><B>10</B> And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife: 'Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say: This is his wife; and they will kill me, but thee they will keep alive.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And he dealt well with Abram for her sake; and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And Pharaoh called Abram, and said: 'What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Why saidst thou: She is my sister? so that I took her to be my wife; now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him; and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.</P>
