<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> How is the gold become dim! How is the most fine gold changed! The hallowed stones are poured out at the head of every street. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones; the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask bread, and none breaketh it unto them. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> They that did feed on dainties are desolate in the streets; they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands fell upon her. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Her princes were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire; <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Their visage is blacker than coal; they are not known in the streets; their skin is shrivelled upon their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger; for these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> The hands of women full of compassion have sodden their own children; they were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> The LORD hath accomplished His fury, He hath poured out His fierce anger; and He hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world, that the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> It is because of the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood, so that men cannot touch their garments. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> 'Depart ye! unclean!' men cried unto them, 'Depart, depart, touch not'; yea, they fled away and wandered; men said among the nations: 'They shall no more sojourn here.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> The anger of the LORD hath divided them; He will no more regard them; they respected not the persons of the priests, they were not gracious unto the elders. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> As for us, our eyes do yet fail for our vain help; in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our broad places; our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heaven; they chased us upon the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits; of whom we said: 'Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz: the cup shall pass over unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion, He will no more carry thee away into captivity; He will punish thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom, He will uncover thy sins. <B>{P}</B></P>
