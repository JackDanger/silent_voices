<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Deuteronomy Chapter 21</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him;
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which may neither be plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near--for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto Him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And they shall speak and say: 'Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Forgive, O LORD, Thy people Israel, whom Thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood to remain in the midst of Thy people Israel.' And the blood shall be forgiven them.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive,
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> and seest among the captives a woman of goodly form, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife;
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month; and after that thou mayest go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated;
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born;
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the first-fruits of his strength, the right of the first-born is his. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not hearken to the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them;
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> and they shall say unto the elders of his city: 'This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he doth not hearken to our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.'
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree;
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is a reproach unto God; that thou defile not thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. <B>{S}</B></P>
