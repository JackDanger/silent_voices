<B>3</B> The integrity of the upright shall guide them; but the perverseness of the faithless shall destroy them.<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Riches profit not in the day of wrath; but righteousness delivereth from death.<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> The righteousness of the sincere shall make straight his way; but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them; but the faithless shall be trapped in their own crafty device.<BR>

<B>7</B> When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish, and the hope of strength perisheth.<BR>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> With his mouth the impious man destroyeth his neighbour; but through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered.<BR>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth; and when the wicked perish, there is joy.<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted; but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> He that despiseth his neighbour lacketh understanding; but a man of discernment holdeth his peace.<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets; but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter.<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Where no wise direction is, a people falleth; but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it; but he that hateth them that strike hands is secure.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> A gracious woman obtaineth honour; and strong men obtain riches.<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> The merciful man doeth good to his own soul; but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.<BR>

<B>18</B> The wicked earneth deceitful wages; but he that soweth righteousness hath a sure reward.<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>

<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> They that are perverse in heart are an abomination to the LORD; but such as are upright in their way are His delight.<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> My hand upon it! the evil man shall not be unpunished; but the seed of the righteous shall escape.<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> As a ring of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman that turneth aside from discretion.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> The desire of the righteous is only good; but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth only to want.<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> The beneficent soul shall be made rich, and he that satisfieth abundantly shall be satisfied also himself.<BR>

<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favour; but he that searcheth for evil, it shall come unto him.<BR>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall flourish as foliage.<BR>
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; and the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.<BR>
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that is wise winneth souls.<BR>
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> Behold, the righteous shall be requited in the earth; how much more the wicked and the sinner!</P>
