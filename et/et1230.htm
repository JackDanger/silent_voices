<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Ezekiel Chapter 30</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> 'Son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord GOD: wail ye: Woe worth the day!
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a day of clouds, it shall be the time of the nations.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and convulsion shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her abundance, and her foundation shall be broken down.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<P><B>6</B> Thus saith the LORD: they also that uphold Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her power shall come down; from Migdol to Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> In that day shall messengers go forth from before Me in ships to make the confident Ethiopians afraid; and there shall come convulsion upon them in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And I will make the rivers dry, and will give the land over into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers; I the LORD have spoken it. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the things of nought to cease from Noph; and there shall be no more a prince out of the land of Egypt; and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And I will pour My fury upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And I will set a fire in Egypt; Sin shall be in great convulsion, and No shall be rent asunder; and in Noph shall come adversaries in the day-time.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword; and these cities shall go into captivity.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her; as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt; and they shall know that I am the LORD.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<P><B>20</B> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> 'Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up to be healed, to put a roller, that it be bound up and wax strong, that it hold the sword. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put My sword in his hand; but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am the LORD.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
