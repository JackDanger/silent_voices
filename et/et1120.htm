<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Jeremiah Chapter 20</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Now Pashhur the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of the LORD.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him: 'The LORD hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magormissabib. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> For thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Moreover I will give all the store of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the wealth thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<P><B>7</B> O LORD, Thou hast enticed me, and I was enticed, Thou hast overcome me, and hast prevailed; I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocketh me.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> For as often as I speak, I cry out, I cry: 'Violence and spoil'; because the word of the LORD is made a reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And if I say: 'I will not make mention of Him, nor speak any more in His name', then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I weary myself to hold it in, but cannot.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> For I have heard the whispering of many, terror on every side: 'Denounce, and we will denounce him'; even of all my familiar friends, them that watch for my halting: 'Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> But the LORD is with me as a mighty warrior; therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be greatly ashamed, because they have not prospered, even with an everlasting confusion which shall never be forgotten.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, that seest the reins and the heart, let me see Thy vengeance on them; for unto Thee have I revealed my cause. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD; for He hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Cursed be the day wherein I was born; the day wherein my mother bore me, let it not be blessed.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying: 'A man-child is born unto thee'; making him very glad.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not; and let him hear a cry in the morning, and an alarm at noontide;
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Because He slew me not from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed in shame? <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
