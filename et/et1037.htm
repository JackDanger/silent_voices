<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Isaiah Chapter 37</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And they said unto him: 'Thus saith Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to taunt the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD thy God hath heard; wherefore make prayer for the remnant that is left.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And Isaiah said unto them: 'Thus shall ye say to your master: Thus saith the LORD: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return unto his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia: 'He is come out to fight against thee.' And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying:
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> 'Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Let not thy God in whom thou trustest beguile thee, saying: Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying:
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> 'O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, that sittest upon the cherubim, Thou art the God, even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made heaven and earth.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open Thine eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to taunt the living God.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art the LORD, even Thou only.'
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying: 'Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> this is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> Whom hast thou taunted and blasphemed? And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice? Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high, even against the Holy One of Israel!
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> By thy servants hast thou taunted the Lord, and hast said: With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I have cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice cypress-trees thereof; and I have entered into his farthest height, the forest of his fruitful field.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> I have digged and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of Egypt.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> Hast thou not heard? Long ago I made it, in ancient times I fashioned it; now have I brought it to pass, yea, it is done; that fortified cities should be laid waste into ruinous heaps.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field of corn before it is grown up.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against Me.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> Because of thy raging against Me, and for that thine uproar is come up into Mine ears, therefore will I put My hook in thy nose, and My bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape; the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall perform this. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast a mound against it.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith the LORD.
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> For I will defend this city to save it, for Mine own sake, and for My servant David's sake.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> And the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went, and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
<A NAME="38"> </A>
<B>38</B> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sarezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. <B>{S}</B></P>
