<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> The words of king Lemuel; the burden wherewith his mother corrected him.<BR>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> What, my son? and what, O son of my womb? and what, O son of my vows?<BR>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine: nor for princes to say: 'Where is strong drink?'<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Lest they drink, and forget that which is decreed, and pervert the justice due to any that is afflicted.<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter in soul;<BR>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<P><B>8</B> Open thy mouth for the dumb, in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<P><B>10</B> A woman of valour who can find? for her price is far above rubies.<BR>

<B>11</B> The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, and he hath no lack of gain.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> She doeth him good and not evil all the days of her life.<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> She is like the merchant-ships; she bringeth her food from afar.<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth food to her household, and a portion to her maidens.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> She considereth a field, and buyeth it; with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> She girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her arms.<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> She perceiveth that her merchandise is good; her lamp goeth not out by night.<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> She layeth her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household are clothed with scarlet.<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> She maketh for herself coverlets; her clothing is fine linen and purple.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> She maketh linen garments and selleth them; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> Strength and dignity are her clothing; and she laugheth at the time to come.<BR>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and the law of kindness is on her tongue.<BR>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.<BR>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her:<BR>
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> 'Many daughters have done valiantly, but thou excellest them all.'<BR>
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.<BR>
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her works praise her in the gates. <B>{P}</B></P>
