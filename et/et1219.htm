<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> and say: How was thy mother a lioness; among lions she couched, in the midst of the young lions she reared her whelps!
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And she brought up one of her whelps, he became a young lion; and he learned to catch the prey, he devoured men.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Then the nations assembled against him, he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks unto the land of Egypt.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Now when she saw that she was disappointed, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion; and he learned to catch the prey, he devoured men.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And he knew their castles, and laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, because of the noise of his roaring.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Then the nations cried out against him on every side from the provinces; and they spread their net over him, he was taken in their pit.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And they put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him to the king of Babylon; that they might bring him into strongholds, so that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<P><B>10</B> Thy mother was like a vine, in thy likeness, planted by the waters; she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And she had strong rods to be sceptres for them that bore rule; and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she was seen in her height with the multitude of her tendrils.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit; her strong rods were broken off and withered, the fire consumed her.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And fire is gone out of the rod of her branches, it hath devoured her fruit, so that there is in her no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule.' This is a lamentation, and it was for a lamentation. <B>{P}</B></P>
