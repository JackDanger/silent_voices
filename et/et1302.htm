<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Hosea Chapter 2</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that, instead of that which was said unto them: 'Ye are not My people', it shall be said unto them: 'Ye are the children of the living God.'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up out of the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Say ye unto your brethren: 'Ammi'; and to your sisters, 'Ruhamah.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not My wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her harlotries from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And I will not have compassion upon her children; for they are children of harlotry.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> For their mother hath played the harlot, she that conceived them hath done shamefully; for she said: 'I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and I will make a wall against her, that she shall not find her paths.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And she shall run after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them, and she shall seek them, but shall not find them; then shall she say: 'I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> For she did not know that it was I that gave her the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Therefore will I take back My corn in the time thereof, and My wine in the season thereof, and will snatch away My wool and My flax given to cover her nakedness.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And now will I uncover her shame in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of My hand.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her appointed seasons.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, whereof she hath said: 'These are my hire that my lovers have given me'; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, wherein she offered unto them, and decked herself with her ear-rings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot Me, saith the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly unto her.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall respond there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call Me Ishi, and shalt call Me no more Baali.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be mentioned by their name.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground; and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And I will betroth thee unto Me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness, and in justice, and in lovingkindness, and in compassion.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And I will betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<P><B>23</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, I will respond, saith the LORD, I will respond to the heavens, and they shall respond to the earth;
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And the earth shall respond to the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall respond to Jezreel.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And I will sow her unto Me in the land; and I will have compassion upon her that had not obtained compassion; and I will say to them that were not My people: 'Thou art My people'; and they shall say: 'Thou art my God.' <B>{P}</B></P>
