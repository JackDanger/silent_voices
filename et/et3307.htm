<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Esther Chapter 7</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine: 'Whatever thy petition, queen Esther, it shall be granted thee; and whatever thy request, even to the half of the kingdom, it shall be performed.'
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Then Esther the queen answered and said: 'If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request;
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, for the adversary is not worthy that the king be endamaged.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Then spoke the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen: 'Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And Esther said: 'An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman.' Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden; but Haman remained to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king: 'Will he even force the queen before me in the house?' As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king: 'Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman.' And the king said: 'Hang him thereon.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath assuaged. <B>{S}</B></P>
