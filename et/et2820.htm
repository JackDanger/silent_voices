<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> It is an honour for a man to keep aloof from strife; but every fool will be snarling.<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> The sluggard will not plow when winter setteth in; therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.<BR>

<B>9</B> Who can say: 'I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin'?<BR>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them alike are an abomination to the LORD.<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt have bread in plenty.<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> 'It is bad, it is bad', saith the buyer; but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> There is gold, and a multitude of rubies; but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; and hold him in pledge that is surety for an alien woman.<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Every purpose is established by counsel; and with good advice carry on war.<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets; therefore meddle not with him that openeth wide his lips.<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in the blackest darkness.<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> An estate may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Say not thou: 'I will requite evil'; wait for the LORD, and He will save thee.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> Divers weights are an abomination to the LORD; and a false balance is not good.<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> A man's goings are of the LORD; how then can man look to his way?<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>

<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> A wise king sifteth the wicked, and turneth the wheel over them.<BR>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD, searching all the inward parts.<BR>
