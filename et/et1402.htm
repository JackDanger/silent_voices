<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Joel Chapter 2</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Blow ye the horn in Zion, and sound an alarm in My holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is at hand;
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> A day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as blackness spread upon the mountains; a great people and a mighty, there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> A fire devoureth before them, and behind them a flame blazeth; the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing escapeth them.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Like the noise of chariots, on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a mighty people set in battle array.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces have gathered blackness.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> They run like mighty men, they climb the wall like men of war; and they move on every one in his ways, and they entangle not their paths.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Neither doth one thrust another, they march every one in his highway; and they break through the weapons, and suffer no harm.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> They leap upon the city, they run upon the wall, they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Before them the earth quaketh, the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are become black, and the stars withdraw their shining.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And the LORD uttereth His voice before His army; for His camp is very great, for he is mighty that executeth His word; for great is the day of the LORD and very terrible; and who can abide it?
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Yet even now, saith the LORD, turn ye unto Me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with lamentation;
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God; for He is gracious and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy, and repenteth Him of the evil.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Who knoweth whether He will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind Him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto the LORD your God? <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<P><B>15</B> Blow the horn in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her pavilion.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say: 'Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not Thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should make them a byword: wherefore should they say among the peoples: Where is their God?'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Then was the LORD jealous for His land, and had pity on His people.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And the LORD answered and said unto His people: 'Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> But I will remove far off from you the northern one, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the eastern sea, and his hinder part toward the western sea; that his foulness may come up, and his ill savour may come up, because he hath done great things.'
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for the LORD hath done great things.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God; for He giveth you the former rain in just measure, and He causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, at the first.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And the floors shall be full of corn, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpiller, and the palmer-worm, My great army which I sent among you.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and My people shall never be ashamed.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and there is none else; and My people shall never be ashamed. <B>{P}</B></P>
