<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Deuteronomy Chapter 24</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> When a man taketh a wife, and marrieth her, then it cometh to pass, if she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, that he writeth her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house,
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> and she departeth out of his house, and goeth and becometh another man's wife,
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> and the latter husband hateth her, and writeth her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD; and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go out in the host, neither shall he be charged with any business; he shall be free for his house one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he taketh a man's life to pledge. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, and sell him; then that thief shall die; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you, as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam, by the way as ye came forth out of Egypt. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> When thou dost lend thy neighbour any manner of loan, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring forth the pledge without unto thee.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And if he be a poor man, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge;
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> thou shalt surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless thee; and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> In the same day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD and it be sin in thee. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Thou shalt not pervert the justice due to the stranger, or to the fatherless; nor take the widow's raiment to pledge.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence; therefore I command thee to do this thing. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go back to fetch it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> When thou beatest thine olive-tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it after thee; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt; therefore I command thee to do this thing. <B>{S}</B></P>
