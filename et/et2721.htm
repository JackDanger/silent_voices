<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Job Chapter 21</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> <B>{S}</B> Then Job answered and said:<BR>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Hear diligently my speech; and let this be your consolations.<BR>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Suffer me, that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> As for me, is my complaint to man? Or why should I not be impatient?<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Turn unto me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Even when I remember I am affrighted, and horror hath taketh hold on my flesh.<BR>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, wax mighty in power?<BR>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Their houses are safe, without fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.<BR>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> They sing to the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> They spend their days in prosperity, and peacefully they go down to the grave.<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Yet they said unto God: 'Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?'--<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand; the counsel of the wicked is far from me.<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? that their calamity cometh upon them? <B>{N}</B><BR>that He distributeth pains in His anger?<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> That they are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm stealeth away?<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> 'God layeth up his iniquity for his children!'--let Him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it.<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> For what pleasure hath he in his house after him? seeing the number of his months is determined.<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing it is He that judgeth those that are high.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet;<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> His pails are full of milk, and the marrow of his bones is moistened.<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And another dieth in bitterness of soul, and hath never tasted of good.<BR>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> They lie down alike in the dust, and the worm covereth them.<BR>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.<BR>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> For ye say: 'Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?'<BR>
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> Have ye not asked them that go by the way; and will ye misdeem their tokens,<BR>
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity, that they are led forth to the day of wrath?<BR>
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> But who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done?<BR>
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> For he is borne to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb.<BR>
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> The clods of the valley are sweet unto him, and all men draw after him, as there were innumerable before him.<BR>
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> How then comfort ye me in vain? And as for your answers, there remaineth only faithlessness?</P>
