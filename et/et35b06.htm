<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein--though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates--
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying: 'Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono.' But they thought to do me mischief.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And I sent messengers unto them, saying: 'I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down; why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> wherein was written: 'It is reported among the nations, and Geshem saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou buildest the wall; and thou wouldest be their king, even according to these words.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And thou hast also appointed prophets to proclaim of thee at Jerusalem, saying: There is a king in Judah; and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Then I sent unto him, saying: 'There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.'
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> For they all would have us afraid, saying: 'Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done.' But now, strengthen Thou my hands.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And as for me, I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said: 'Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And I said: 'Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, could go into the temple and live? I will not go in.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; for he pronounced this prophecy against me, whereas Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might taunt me. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<P><B>14</B> Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have me put in fear.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<P><B>16</B> And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard thereof, that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</P>
