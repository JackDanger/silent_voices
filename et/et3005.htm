<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> I sleep, but my heart waketh; Hark! my beloved knocketh: 'Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.'
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my heart was moved for him.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with flowing myrrh, upon the handles of the bar.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had turned away, and was gone. My soul failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> The watchmen that go about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> 'I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, what will ye tell him? that I am love-sick.'
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> 'What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so adjure us?'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> 'My beloved is white and ruddy, pre-eminent above ten thousand.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are curled, and black as a raven.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks; washed with milk, and fitly set.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as banks of sweet herbs; his lips are as lilies, dropping with flowing myrrh.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> His hands are as rods of gold set with beryl; his body is as polished ivory overlaid with sapphires.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold; his aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> His mouth is most sweet; yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.'</P>
