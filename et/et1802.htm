<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Micah Chapter 2</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! When the morning is light, they execute it, because it is in the power of their hand.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away; thus they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<P><B>3</B> Therefore thus saith the LORD: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk upright; for it shall be an evil time.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say: 'We are utterly ruined; he changeth the portion of my people; how doth he remove it from me! Instead of restoring our fields, he divideth them.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the congregation of the LORD.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> 'Preach ye not', they preach; 'They shall not preach of these things, that they shall not take shame.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Do I change, O house of Jacob? Is the spirit of the LORD straitened? Are these His doings? Do not My words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> But of late My people is risen up as an enemy; with the garment ye strip also the mantle from them that pass by securely, so that they are as men returning from war.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> The women of My people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away My glory for ever.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because of the uncleanness thereof, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> If a man walking in wind and falsehood do lie: 'I will preach unto thee of wine and of strong drink'; he shall even be the preacher of this people.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will render them all as sheep in a fold; as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> The breaker is gone up before them; they have broken forth and passed on, by the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is passed on before them, and the LORD at the head of them. <B>{P}</B></P>
