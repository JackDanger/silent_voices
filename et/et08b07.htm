<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">2 Samuel Chapter 7</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies round about,
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> that the king said unto Nathan the prophet: 'See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.'
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And Nathan said to the king: 'Go, do all that is in thy heart; for the LORD is with thee.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And it came to pass the same night, <B>{S}</B> that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying:
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> 'Go and tell My servant David: <B>{S}</B> Thus saith the LORD: Shalt thou build Me a house for Me to dwell in?
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> In all places wherein I have walked among all the children of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed My people Israel, saying: Why have ye not built Me a house of cedar?
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto My servant David: Thus saith the LORD of hosts: I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over My people, over Israel.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And I have been with thee whithersoever thou didst go, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be disquieted no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies. Moreover the LORD telleth thee that the LORD will make thee a house.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy body, and I will establish his kingdom.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son; if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> but My mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee; thy throne shall be established for ever.'
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<P><B>18</B> Then David the king went in, and sat before the LORD; and he said: 'Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that Thou hast brought me thus far?
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And this was yet a small thing in Thine eyes, O Lord GOD; but Thou hast spoken also of Thy servant's house for a great while to come; and this too after the manner of great men, O Lord GOD.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And what can David say more unto Thee? for Thou knowest Thy servant, O Lord GOD.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> For Thy word's sake, and according to Thine own heart, hast Thou wrought all this greatness, to make Thy servant know it.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Therefore Thou art great, O LORD God; for there is none like Thee, neither is there any God beside Thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And who is like Thy people, like Israel, a nation one in the earth, whom God went to redeem unto Himself for a people, and to make Him a name, and to do for Thy land great things and tremendous, even for you, [in driving out] from before Thy people, whom Thou didst redeem to Thee out of Egypt, the nations and their gods?
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And Thou didst establish to Thyself Thy people Israel to be a people unto Thee for ever; and Thou, LORD, becamest their God. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And now, O LORD God, the word that Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm Thou it for ever, and do as Thou hast spoken.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And let Thy name be magnified for ever, that it may be said: The LORD of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of Thy servant David shall be established before Thee.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> For Thou, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to Thy servant, saying: I will build thee a house; therefore hath Thy servant taken heart to pray this prayer unto Thee.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And now, O Lord GOD, Thou alone art God, and Thy words are truth, and Thou hast promised this good thing unto Thy servant;
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> now therefore let it please Thee to bless the house of Thy servant, that it may continue for ever before Thee; for Thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it; and through Thy blessing let the house of Thy servant be blessed for ever.' <B>{P}</B></P>
