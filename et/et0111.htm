<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And they said one to another: 'Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly.' And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And they said: 'Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, with its top in heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And the LORD said: 'Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do; and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off to build the city.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<P><B>10</B> These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begot Arpachshad two years after the flood.

<B>14</B> And Shelah lived thirty years, and begot Eber.

<B>16</B> And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begot Peleg.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And Eber lived after he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And Peleg lived after he begot Reu two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begot Serug.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And Reu lived after he begot Serug two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begot Terah.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And Nahor lived after he begot Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And Sarai was barren; she had no child.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran. <B>{P}</B></P>
