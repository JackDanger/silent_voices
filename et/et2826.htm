<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Proverbs Chapter 26</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.<BR>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> As the wandering sparrow, as the flying swallow, so the curse that is causeless shall come home.<BR>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the back of fools.<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes.<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off his own feet, and drinketh damage.<BR>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> The legs hang limp from the lame; so is a parable in the mouth of fools.<BR>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> As a small stone in a heap of stones, so is he that giveth honour to a fool.<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> As a thorn that cometh into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools.<BR>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> A master performeth all things; but he that stoppeth a fool is as one that stoppeth a flood.<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> As a dog that returneth to his vomit, so is a fool that repeateth his folly.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Seest thou a man wise in his own eyes? there is more hope of a fool than of him.<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> The sluggard saith: 'There is a lion in the way; yea, a lion is in the streets.'<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> The door is turning upon its hinges, and the sluggard is still upon his bed.<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish; it wearieth him to bring it back to his mouth.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men that give wise answer.<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife not his own, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> As a madman who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death;<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith: 'Am not I in sport?'<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Where no wood is, the fire goeth out; and where there is no whisperer, contention ceaseth.<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<P><B>22</B> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, and they go down into the innermost parts of the body.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> Burning lips and a wicked heart are like an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross.<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, but he layeth up deceit within him.<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> When he speaketh fair, believe him not; for there are seven abominations in his heart.<BR>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> Though his hatred be concealed with deceit, his wickedness shall be revealed before the congregation.<BR>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; and he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him.<BR>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> A lying tongue hateth those that are crushed by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.</P>
