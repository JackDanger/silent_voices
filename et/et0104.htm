<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived and bore Cain, and said: 'I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD.'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And again she bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering;
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And the LORD said unto Cain: 'Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee is its desire, but thou mayest rule over it.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Cain spoke unto Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And the LORD said unto Cain: 'Where is Abel thy brother?' And he said: 'I know not; am I my brother's keeper?'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And He said: 'What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And Cain said unto the LORD: 'My punishment is greater than I can bear.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land; and from Thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.'
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And the LORD said unto him: 'Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.' And the LORD set a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch; and he builded a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael; and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lamech.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And Lamech took unto him two wives; the name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech; for I have slain a man for wounding me, and a young man for bruising me;
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: 'for God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.'
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh; then began men to call upon the name of the LORD. <B>{S}</B></P>
