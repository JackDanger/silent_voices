<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Joel Chapter 1</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or in the days of your fathers?
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Awake, ye drunkards, and weep, and wail, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine, for it is cut off from your mouth.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> For a people is come up upon my land, mighty, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> He hath laid my vine waste, and blasted my fig-tree; he hath made it clean bare, and cast it down, the branches thereof are made white.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> The meal-offering and the drink-offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests mourn, even the LORD'S ministers.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Be ashamed, O ye husbandmen, wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> The vine is withered, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered; for joy is withered away from the sons of men. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests, wail, ye ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God; for the meal-offering and the drink-offering is withholden from the house of your God.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land unto the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Is not the food cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> The grains shrivel under their hoes; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Unto Thee, O LORD, do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath set ablaze all the trees of the field.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto Thee; for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness. <B>{S}</B></P>
