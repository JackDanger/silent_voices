<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Jeremiah Chapter 49</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Of the children of Ammon. Thus saith the LORD: Hath Israel no sons? Hath he no heir? Why then doth Malcam take possession of Gad, and his people dwell in the cities thereof?
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate mound, and her daughters shall be burned with fire; then shall Israel dispossess them that did dispossess him, saith the LORD.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is undone; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro among the folds; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that didst trust in thy treasures: 'Who shall come unto me?'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Behold, I will bring a terror upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all that are round about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather up him that wandereth.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<P><B>7</B> Of Edom. Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? Is counsel perished from the prudent? Is their wisdom vanished?
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I do bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I shall punish him.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> If grape-gatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, would they not destroy till they had enough?
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself; his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Leave thy fatherless children, I will rear them, and let thy widows trust in Me. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> For thus saith the LORD: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> For I have sworn by Myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> I have heard a message from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent among the nations: 'Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.'
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> For, behold, I make thee small among the nations, and despised among men.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, even the pride of thy heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill; though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And Edom shall become an astonishment; every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan against the strong habitation; for I will suddenly make him run away from it, and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it; for who is like Me? and who will appoint Me a time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before Me? <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that He hath taken against Edom; and His purposes, that He hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: surely the least of the flock shall drag them away, surely their habitation shall be appalled at them.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> The earth quaketh at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Behold, he shall come up and swoop down as the vulture, and spread out his wings against Bozrah; and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<P><B>23</B> Of Damascus. Hamath is ashamed, and Arpad; for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away; there is trouble in the sea; it cannot be quiet.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee, and trembling hath seized on her; anguish and pangs have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> 'How is the city of praise left unrepaired, the city of my joy?'
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> Therefore her young men shall fall in her broad places, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<P><B>28</B> Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote. Thus saith the LORD: Arise ye, go up against Kedar, and spoil the children of the east.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> Their tents and their flocks shall they take, they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall proclaim against them a terror on every side.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> Flee ye, flit far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> Arise, get you up against a nation that is at ease, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil; and I will scatter unto all winds them that have the corners polled; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, saith the LORD.
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> And Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation for ever; no man shall abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying:
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> Thus saith the LORD of hosts: behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> And I will bring against Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the dispersed of Elam shall not come.
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life; and I will bring evil upon them, even My fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them;
<A NAME="38"> </A>
<B>38</B> And I will set My throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence king and princes, saith the LORD.
<A NAME="39"> </A>
<B>39</B> But it shall come to pass in the end of days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
