<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulammite? As it were a dance of two companies.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> How beautiful are thy steps in sandals, O prince's daughter! The roundings of thy thighs are like the links of a chain, the work of the hands of a skilled workman.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Thy navel is like a round goblet, wherein no mingled wine is wanting; thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a gazelle.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim; thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple; the king is held captive in the tresses thereof.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> I said: 'I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof; and let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy countenance like apples;
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine, that glideth down smoothly for my beloved, moving gently the lips of those that are asleep.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see whether the vine hath budded, whether the vine-blossom be opened, and the pomegranates be in flower; there will I give thee my love.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</P>
