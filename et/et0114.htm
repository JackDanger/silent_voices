<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Genesis Chapter 14</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela--the same is Zoar.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> All these came as allies unto the vale of Siddim--the same is the Salt Sea.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And they turned back, and came to En-mishpat--the same is Kadesh--and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela--the same is Zoar; and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim;
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew--now he dwelt by the terebinths of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh--the same is the King's Vale.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; and he was priest of God the Most High.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And he blessed him, and said: 'Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth;
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> and blessed be God the Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.' And he gave him a tenth of all.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And the king of Sodom said unto Abram: 'Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.'
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And Abram said to the king of Sodom: 'I have lifted up my hand unto the LORD, God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth,
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say: I have made Abram rich;
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, let them take their portion.' <B>{S}</B></P>
