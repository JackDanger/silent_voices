<P><B>1</B> Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us; behold, and see our reproach.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Our inheritance is turned unto strangers, our houses unto aliens.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> We are become orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> We have drunk our water for money; our wood cometh to us for price.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> To our very necks we are pursued; we labour, and have no rest.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> We have given the hand to Egypt, and to Assyria, to have bread enough;
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Servants rule over us; there is none to deliver us out of their hand.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> We get our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Our skin is hot like an oven because of the burning heat of famine.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> They have ravished the women in Zion, the maidens in the cities of Judah.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Princes are hanged up by their hand; the faces of elders are not honoured.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> The young men have borne the mill, and the children have stumbled under the wood.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> The crown is fallen from our head; woe unto us! for we have sinned.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> For this our heart is faint, for these things our eyes are dim;
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<P><B>19</B> Thou, O LORD, art enthroned for ever, Thy throne is from generation to generation.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Wherefore dost Thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time?
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Turn Thou us unto Thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Thou canst not have utterly rejected us, and be exceeding wroth against us! <B>{P}</B></P>
