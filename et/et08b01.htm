<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">2 Samuel Chapter 1</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head; and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and prostrated himself.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And David said unto him: 'From whence comest thou?' And he said unto him: 'Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And David said unto him: 'How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.' And he answered: 'The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And David said unto the young man that told him: 'How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And the young man that told him said: 'As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen pressed hard upon him.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered: Here am I.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And he said unto me: Who art thou? And I answered him: I am an Amalekite.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And he said unto me: Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me, for the agony hath taken hold of me; because my life is just yet in me.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And they wailed, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<P><B>13</B> And David said unto the young man that told him: 'Whence art thou?' And he answered: 'I am the son of an Amalekite stranger.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And David said unto him: 'How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?'
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And David called one of the young men, and said: 'Go near, and fall upon him.' And he smote him that he died.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And David said unto him: 'Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying: I have slain the LORD'S anointed.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<P><B>17</B> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son,
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> and said--To teach the sons of Judah the bow. Behold, it is written in the book of Jashar:
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Thy beauty, O Israel, upon thy high places is slain! How are the mighty fallen!
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of choice fruits; for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> Saul and Jonathan, the lovely and the pleasant in their lives, even in their death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan upon thy high places is slain!
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant hast thou been unto me; wonderful was thy love to me, passing the love of women.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
