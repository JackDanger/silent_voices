<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Genesis Chapter 22</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him: 'Abraham'; and he said: 'Here am I.'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And He said: 'Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.'
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he cleaved the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And Abraham said unto his young men: 'Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come back to you.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said: 'My father.' And he said: 'Here am I, my son.' And he said: 'Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Abraham said: 'God will provide Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son.' So they went both of them together.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said: 'Abraham, Abraham.' And he said: 'Here am I.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And he said: 'Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him; for now I know that thou art a God-fearing man, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from Me.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And Abraham called the name of that place Adonai-jireh; as it is said to this day: 'In the mount where the LORD is seen.'
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> and said: 'By Myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast hearkened to My voice.'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<P><B>20</B> And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying: 'Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor:
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram;
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.'
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And Bethuel begot Rebekah; these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah. <B>{P}</B></P>
