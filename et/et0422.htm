<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many; and Moab was overcome with dread because of the children of Israel.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And Moab said unto the elders of Midian: 'Now will this multitude lick up all that is round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field.'--And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.--
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And he sent messengers unto Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying: 'Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt; behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me; peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spoke unto him the words of Balak.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And he said unto them: 'Lodge here this night, and I will bring you back word, as the LORD may speak unto me'; and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And God came unto Balaam, and said: 'What men are these with thee?'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And Balaam said unto God: 'Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me [saying]:
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Behold the people that is come out of Egypt, it covereth the face of the earth; now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And God said unto Balaam: 'Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak: 'Get you into your land; for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said: 'Balaam refuseth to come with us.'
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And they came to Balaam, and said to him: 'Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor: Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me;
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> for I will promote thee unto very great honour, and whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will do; come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak: 'If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do any thing, small or great.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will speak unto me more.'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him: 'If the men are come to call thee, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.'
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of the LORD placed himself in the way for an adversary against him.--Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.--
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field; and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Then the angel of the LORD stood in a hollow way between the vineyards, a fence being on this side, and a fence on that side.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And the ass saw the angel of the LORD, and she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall; and he smote her again.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And the ass saw the angel of the LORD, and she lay down under Balaam; and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam: 'What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?'
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And Balaam said unto the ass: 'Because thou hast mocked me; I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed thee.'
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And the ass said unto Balaam: 'Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden all thy life long unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee?' And he said: 'Nay.'
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> And the angel of the LORD said unto him: 'Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because thy way is contrary unto me;
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> and the ass saw me, and turned aside before me these three times; unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain thee, and saved her alive.'
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD: 'I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me; now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back.'
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam: 'Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak.' So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto Ir-moab, which is on the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> And Balak said unto Balaam: 'Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?'
<A NAME="38"> </A>
<B>38</B> And Balaam said unto Balak: 'Lo, I am come unto thee; have I now any power at all to speak any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.'
<A NAME="39"> </A>
<B>39</B> And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-huzoth.
<A NAME="40"> </A>
<B>40</B> And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.
<A NAME="41"> </A>
<B>41</B> And it came to pass in the morning that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into Bamoth-baal, and he saw from thence the utmost part of the people.</P>
