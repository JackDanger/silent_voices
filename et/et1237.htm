<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Ezekiel Chapter 37</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> The hand of the LORD was upon me, and the LORD carried me out in a spirit, and set me down in the midst of the valley, and it was full of bones;
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> and He caused me to pass by them round about, and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And He said unto me: 'Son of man, can these bones live?' And I answered: 'O Lord GOD, Thou knowest.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Then He said unto me: 'Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them: O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD:
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a commotion, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And I beheld, and, lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Then said He unto me: 'Prophesy unto the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath: <B>{S}</B> Thus saith the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great host.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Then He said unto me: 'Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold, they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Therefore prophesy, and say unto them: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, O My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, O My people.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And I will put My spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I will place you in your own land; and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken, and performed it, saith the LORD.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<P><B>15</B> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> 'And thou, son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it: For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions; then take another stick, and write upon it: For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and of all the house of Israel his companions;
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> and join them for thee one to another into one stick, that they may become one in thy hand.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying: Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by these?
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> say into them: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them unto him together with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in My hand.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And say unto them: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, whither they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land;
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling-places, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them; so shall they be My people, and I will be their God.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And My servant David shall be king over them, and they all shall have one shepherd; they shall also walk in Mine ordinances, and observe My statutes, and do them.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob My servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children's children, for ever; and David My servant shall be their prince for ever.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them--it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will establish them, and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> My dwelling-place also shall be over them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And the nations shall know that I am the LORD that sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever.' <B>{P}</B></P>
