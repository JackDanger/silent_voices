<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Dead flies make the ointment of the perfumer fetid and putrid; so doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honour.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> A wise man's understanding is at his right hand; but a fool's understanding at his left.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Yea also, when a fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for gentleness allayeth great offences.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which proceedeth from a ruler:
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Folly is set on great heights, and the rich sit in low place.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a fence, a serpent shall bite him.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Whoso quarrieth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength; but wisdom is profitable to direct.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> If the serpent bite before it is charmed, then the charmer hath no advantage.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is grievous madness.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> A fool also multiplieth words; yet man knoweth not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him?
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> The labour of fools wearieth every one of them, for he knoweth not how to go to the city.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a boy, and thy princes feast in the morning!
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is a free man, and thy princes eat in due season, in strength, and not in drunkenness!
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> By slothfulness the rafters sink in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life; and money answereth all things.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought, and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber; for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</P>
