<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Ezekiel Chapter 7</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> 'And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the land of Israel: An end! the end is come upon the four corners of the land.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Now is the end upon thee, and I will send Mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And Mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<P><B>5</B> Thus saith the Lord GOD: An evil, a singular evil, behold, it cometh.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> An end is come, the end is come, it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> The turn is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land; the time is come, the day of tumult is near, and not of joyful shouting upon the mountains.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Now will I shortly pour out My fury upon thee, and spend Mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; I will bring upon thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I the LORD do smite.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Behold the day; behold, it cometh; the turn is come forth; the rod hath blossomed, arrogancy hath budded.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; nought cometh from them, nor from their tumult, nor from their turmoil, neither is there eminency among them.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> The time is come, the day draweth near; let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive; for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any stand possessed of the iniquity of his life.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> They have blown the horn, and have made all ready, but none goeth to the battle; for My wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within; he that is in the field shall die with the sword, and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> But they that shall at all escape of them, shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> All hands shall be slack, and all knees shall drip with water.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD; they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And as for the beauty of their ornament, which was set for a pride, they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things thereof; therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> I will also turn My face from them, and they shall profane My secret place; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<P><B>23</B> Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Wherefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses; I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> Horror cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> Calamity shall come upon calamity, and rumour shall be upon rumour; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet, and instruction shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with appalment, and the hands of the people of the land shall be enfeebled; I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.' <B>{P}</B></P>
