<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And Balaam said unto Balak: 'Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And Balaam said unto Balak: 'Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go; peradventure the LORD will come to meet me; and whatsoever He showeth me I will tell thee.' And he went to a bare height.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And God met Balaam; and he said unto Him: 'I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said: 'Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And he took up his parable, and said: From Aram Balak bringeth me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the East: 'Come, curse me Jacob, and come, execrate Israel.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I execrate, whom the LORD hath not execrated?
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, it is a people that shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Who hath counted the dust of Jacob, or numbered the stock of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let mine end be like his!
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And Balak said unto Balaam: 'What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And he answered and said: 'Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD putteth in my mouth?'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And Balak said unto him: 'Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all; and curse me them from thence.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And he said unto Balak: 'Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I go toward a meeting yonder.'
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said: 'Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.'
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And he came to him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him: 'What hath the LORD spoken?'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And he took up his parable, and said: Arise, Balak, and hear; give ear unto me, thou son of Zippor:
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> God is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son of man, that He should repent: when He hath said, will He not do it? or when He hath spoken, will He not make it good?
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Behold, I am bidden to bless; and when He hath blessed, I cannot call it back.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> None hath beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath one seen perverseness in Israel; the LORD his God is with him, and the shouting for the King is among them.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> God who brought them forth out of Egypt is for them like the lofty horns of the wild-ox.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> For there is no enchantment with Jacob, neither is there any divination with Israel; now is it said of Jacob and of Israel: 'What hath God wrought!'
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Behold a people that riseth up as a lioness, and as a lion doth he lift himself up; he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And Balak said unto Balaam: 'Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.'
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> But Balaam answered and said unto Balak: 'Told not I thee, saying: All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?'
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And Balak said unto Balaam: 'Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.'
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And Balaam said unto Balak: 'Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.'
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.</P>
