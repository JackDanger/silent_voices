<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Nehemiah Chapter 1</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the castle,
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> that Hanani, one of my brethren, came out of Judah, he and certain men; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And they said unto me: 'The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach; the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> and said: 'I beseech Thee, O LORD, the God of heaven, the great and awful God, that keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments;
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> let Thine ear now be attentive, and Thine eyes open, that Thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, which I pray before Thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel Thy servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against Thee; yea, I and my father's house have sinned.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> We have dealt very corruptly against Thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which Thou didst command Thy servant Moses.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Remember, I beseech Thee, the word that Thou didst command Thy servant Moses, saying: If ye deal treacherously, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples;
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> but if ye return unto Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though your dispersed were in the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to cause My name to dwell there.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Now these are Thy servants and Thy people, whom Thou hast redeemed by Thy great power, and by Thy strong hand.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> O Lord, I beseech Thee, let now Thine ear be attentive to the prayer of Thy servant, and to the prayer of Thy servants, who delight to fear Thy name; and prosper, I pray Thee, Thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.' Now I was cupbearer to the king. <B>{P}</B></P>
