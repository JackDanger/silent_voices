<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> and he said unto Aaron: 'Take thee a bull-calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying: Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meal-offering mingled with oil; for to-day the LORD appeareth unto you.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting; and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And Moses said: 'This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do; that the glory of the LORD may appear unto you.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And Moses said unto Aaron: 'Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and present the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> But the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver of the sin-offering, he made smoke upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And the flesh and the skin were burnt with fire without the camp.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head; and he made them smoke upon the altar.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And he washed the inwards and the legs, and made them smoke upon the burnt-offering on the altar.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And the people's offering was presented; and he took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And the burnt-offering was presented; and he offered it according to the ordinance.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And the meal-offering was presented; and he filled his hand therefrom, and made it smoke upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people; and Aaron's sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about,
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> and the fat of the ox, and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he made the fat smoke upon the altar.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And there came forth fire from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat; and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</P>
