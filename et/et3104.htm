<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Ecclesiastes Chapter 4</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> But I returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun; and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they had no comforter.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Wherefore I praised the dead that are already dead more than the living that are yet alive;
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> but better than they both is he that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Again, I considered all labour and all excelling in work, that it is a man's rivalry with his neighbour. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Better is a handful of quietness, than both the hands full of labour and striving after wind.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches: 'for whom then do I labour, and bereave my soul of pleasure?' This also is vanity, yea, it is a grievous business.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone?
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> For out of prison he came forth to be king; although in his kingdom he was born poor.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the child, the second, that was to stand up in his stead.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> There was no end of all the people, even of all them whom he did lead; yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Guard thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be ready to hearken: it is better than when fools give sacrifices; for they know not that they do evil.</P>
