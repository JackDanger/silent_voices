<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> She hearkened not to the voice, she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD, she drew not near to her God.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are wolves of the desert, they leave not a bone for the morrow.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Her prophets are wanton and treacherous persons; her priests have profaned that which is holy, they have done violence to the law.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> The LORD who is righteous is in the midst of her, He will not do unrighteousness; every morning doth He bring His right to light, it faileth not; but the unrighteous knoweth no shame.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> I have cut off nations, their corners are desolate; I have made their streets waste, so that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> I said: 'Surely thou wilt fear Me, thou wilt receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, despite all that I have visited upon her'; but they betimes corrupted all their doings.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Therefore wait ye for Me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for My determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them Mine indignation, even all My fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of My jealousy.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve Him with one consent.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia shall they bring My suppliants, even the daughter of My dispersed, as Mine offering.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against Me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in My holy mountain.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the name of the LORD.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<P><B>14</B> Sing, O daughter of Zion, shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, He hath cast out thine enemy; The King of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not fear evil any more. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<P><B>16</B> In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: 'Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> The LORD thy God is in the midst of thee, a Mighty One who will save; He will rejoice over thee with joy, He will be silent in His love, He will joy over thee with singing.'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> I will gather them that are far from the appointed season, who are of thee, that hast borne the burden of reproach.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save her that is lame, and gather her that was driven away; and I will make them to be a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will make you to be a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I turn your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
