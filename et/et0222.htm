<P><B>1</B> If a thief be found breaking in, and be smitten so that he dieth, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him.
<A NAME="2"> </A>

<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall pay double. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> If a man cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the shocks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field are consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> If a man deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, he shall pay double.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near unto God, to see whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith: 'This is it,' the cause of both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbour. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep, and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it;
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> the oath of the LORD shall be between them both, to see whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness; he shall not make good that which was torn. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<P><B>13</B> And if a man borrow aught of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make restitution.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> If the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good; if it be a hireling, he loseth his hire. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> He that sacrificeth unto the gods, save unto the LORD only, shall be utterly destroyed.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> If thou afflict them in any wise--for if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry--
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<P><B>24</B> If thou lend money to any of My people, even to the poor with thee, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> If thou at all take thy neighbour's garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him by that the sun goeth down;
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin; wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto Me, that I will hear; for I am gracious. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> Thou shalt not delay to offer of the fulness of thy harvest, and of the outflow of thy presses. The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep; seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it Me.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And ye shall be holy men unto Me; therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs. <B>{S}</B></P>
