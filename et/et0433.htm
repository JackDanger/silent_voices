<A NAME="54"> </A>
<B>54</B> And ye shall inherit the land by lot according to your families--to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance; wheresoever the lot falleth to any man, that shall be his; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherit.
<A NAME="55"> </A>
<B>55</B> But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then shall those that ye let remain of them be as thorns in your eyes, and as pricks in your sides, and they shall harass you in the land wherein ye dwell.
<A NAME="56"> </A>
<B>56</B> And it shall come to pass, that as I thought to do unto them, so will I do unto you. <B>{P}</B></P>
