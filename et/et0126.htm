<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And the LORD appeared unto him, and said: 'Go not down unto Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father;
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands; and by thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves;
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> because that Abraham hearkened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said: 'She is my sister'; for he feared to say: 'My wife'; 'lest the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because she is fair to look upon.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And Abimelech called Isaac, and said: 'Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou: She is my sister?' And Isaac said unto him: 'Because I said: Lest I die because of her.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And Abimelech said: 'What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And Abimelech charged all the people, saying: 'He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold; and the LORD blessed him.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household; and the Philistines envied him.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Now all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And Abimelech said unto Isaac: 'Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.'
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of living water.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And the herdmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdmen, saying: 'The water is ours.' And he called the name of the well Esek; because they contended with him.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And they digged another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it Sitnah.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not. And he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said: 'For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.'
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said: 'I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for My servant Abraham's sake.'
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants digged a well.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And Isaac said unto them: 'Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?'
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And they said: 'We saw plainly that the LORD was with thee; and we said: Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace; thou art now the blessed of the LORD.'
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> And they rose up betimes in the morning, and swore one to another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him: 'We have found water.'
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> And when Esau was forty years old, he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> And they were a bitterness of spirit unto Isaac and to Rebekah. <B>{S}</B></P>
