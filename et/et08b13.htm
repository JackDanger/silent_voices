<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">2 Samuel Chapter 13</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And Amnon was so distressed that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do any thing unto her.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And he said unto him: 'Why, O son of the king, art thou thus becoming leaner from day to day? wilt thou not tell me?' And Amnon said unto him: 'I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And Jonadab said unto him: 'Lay thee down on thy bed, and feign thyself sick; and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him: Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick; and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king: 'Let my sister Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Then David sent home to Tamar, saying: 'Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was lying down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And she took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said: 'Have out all men from me.' And they went out every man from him.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And Amnon said unto Tamar: 'Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat of thy hand.' And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And when she had brought them near unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her: 'Come lie with me, my sister.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And she answered him: 'Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel; do not thou this wanton deed.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And I, whither shall I carry my shame? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the base men in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her: 'Arise, be gone.'
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And she said unto him: 'Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is worse than the other that thou didst unto me.' But he would not hearken unto her.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said: 'Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.'--
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Now she had a garment of many colours upon her; for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled.--And his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of many colours that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And Absalom her brother said unto her: 'Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but now hold thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; take not this thing to heart.' So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And Absalom spoke unto Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<P><B>23</B> And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And Absalom came to the king, and said: 'Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.'
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And the king said to Absalom: 'Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome unto thee.' And he pressed him; howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> Then said Absalom: 'If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us.' And the king said unto him: 'Why should he go with thee?'
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And Absalom commanded his servants, saying: 'Mark ye now, when Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I say unto you: Smite Amnon, then kill him, fear not; have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.'
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up upon his mule, and fled.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the tidings came to David, saying: 'Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<P><B>31</B> Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said: 'Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<P><B>34</B> But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people in a roundabout way by the hill-side.
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> And Jonadab said unto the king: 'Behold, the king's sons are come; as thy servant said, so it is.'
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept; and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And [David] mourned for his son every day.
<A NAME="38"> </A>
<B>38</B> So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
<A NAME="39"> </A>
<B>39</B> And the soul of king David failed with longing for Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead. <B>{S}</B></P>
