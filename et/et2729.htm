<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Job Chapter 29</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> <B>{S}</B> And Job again took up his parable, and said:<BR>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Oh that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me;<BR>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> When His lamp shined above my head, and by His light I walked through darkness;<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> As I was in the days of my youth, when the converse of God was upon my tent;<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> When the Almighty was yet with me, and my children were about me;<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> When my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil!<BR>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> When I went forth to the gate unto the city, when I prepared my seat in the broad place,<BR>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> The young men saw me and hid themselves, and the aged rose up and stood;<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth;<BR>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me, and when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me;<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Because I delivered the poor that cried, the fatherless also, that had none to help him.<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> I put on righteousness, and it clothed itself with me; my justice was as a robe and a diadem.<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> I was a father to the needy; and the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And I broke the jaws of the unrighteous, and plucked the prey out of his teeth.<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Then I said: 'I shall die with my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the phoenix;<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> My root shall be spread out to the waters, and the dew shall lie all night upon my branch;<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> My glory shall be fresh in me, and my bow shall be renewed in my hand.'<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence for my counsel.<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> After my words they spoke not again; and my speech dropped upon them.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> I chose out their way, and sat as chief, <B>{N}</B><BR>and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.</P>
