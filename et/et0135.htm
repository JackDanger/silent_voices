<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Genesis Chapter 35</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And God said unto Jacob: 'Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou didst flee from the face of Esau thy brother.'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him: 'Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments;
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth which was by Shechem.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And they journeyed; and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan--the same is Beth-el--he and all the people that were with him.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el, because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak; and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<P><B>9</B> And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And God said unto him: 'Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name'; and He called his name Israel.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And God said unto him: 'I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And God went up from him in the place where He spoke with him.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He spoke with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Beth-el.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some way to come to Ephrath; and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the mid-wife said unto her: 'Fear not; for this also is a son for thee.'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing--for she died--that she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath--the same is Beth-lehem.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; the same is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond Migdal-eder.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard of it. <B>{P}</B> Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali;
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriatharba--the same is Hebron--where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And Isaac expired, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him. <B>{P}</B></P>
