<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> As an apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. Under its shadow I delighted to sit, and its fruit was sweet to my taste.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> He hath brought me to the banqueting-house, and his banner over me is love.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> 'Stay ye me with dainties, refresh me with apples; for I am love-sick.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Let his left hand be under my head, and his right hand embrace me.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> 'I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, and by the hinds of the field, that ye awaken not, nor stir up love, until it please.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Hark! my beloved! behold, he cometh, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart; behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh in through the windows, he peereth through the lattice.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> My beloved spoke, and said unto me: 'Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> The flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> The fig-tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines in blossom give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the cliff, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> 'Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom.'
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> My beloved is mine, and I am his, that feedeth among the lilies.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Until the day breathe, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a gazelle or a young hart upon the mountains of spices. <B>{S}</B></P>
