<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And I have also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered My covenant.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Wherefore say unto the children of Israel: I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments;
