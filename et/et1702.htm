<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the LORD prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And he said: I called out of mine affliction unto the LORD, and He answered me; out of the belly of the nether-world cried I, and Thou heardest my voice.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> For Thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, and the flood was round about me; all Thy waves and Thy billows passed over me.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And I said: 'I am cast out from before Thine eyes'; yet I will look again toward Thy holy temple.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; the deep was round about me; the weeds were wrapped about my head.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars closed upon me for ever; yet hast Thou brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD; and my prayer came in unto Thee, into Thy holy temple.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> They that regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> But I will sacrifice unto Thee with the voice of thanksgiving; that which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is of the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And the LORD spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. <B>{P}</B></P>
