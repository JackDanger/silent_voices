<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And Ben-hadad the king of Aram gathered all his host together; and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city,
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> and said unto him: 'Thus saith Ben-hadad: Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And the king of Israel answered and said: 'It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king: I am thine, and all that I have.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And the messengers came again, and said: 'Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying: I sent indeed unto thee, saying: Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> but I will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said: 'Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief; for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And all the elders and all the people said unto him: 'Hearken thou not, neither consent.'
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad: 'Tell my lord the king: All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do; but this thing I may not do.' And the messengers departed, and brought him back word.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said: 'The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And the king of Israel answered and said: 'Tell him: Let not him that girdeth on his armour boast himself as he that putteth it off.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And it came to pass, when [Ben-hadad] heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the booths, that he said unto his servants: 'Set yourselves in array.' And they set themselves in array against the city.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And, behold, a prophet came near unto Ahab king of Israel, and said: 'Thus saith the LORD: Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And Ahab said: 'By whom?' And he said: 'Thus saith the LORD: By the young men of the princes of the provinces.' Then he said: 'Who shall begin the battle?' And he answered: 'Thou.'
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying: 'There are men come out from Samaria.'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And he said: 'Whether they are come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they are come out for war, take them alive.'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> So these went out of the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed them.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And they slew every one his man; and the Arameans fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-hadad the king of Aram escaped on a horse with horsemen.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Arameans with a great slaughter.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said unto him: 'Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the return of the year the king of Aram will come up against thee.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<P><B>23</B> And the servants of the king of Aram said unto him: 'Their God is a God of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put governors in their room:
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.' And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<P><B>26</B> And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them; and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Arameans filled the country.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And a man of God came near and spoke unto the king of Israel, and said: 'Thus saith the LORD: Because the Arameans have said: The LORD is a God of the hills, but he is not a God of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.'
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel slew of the Arameans a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> And his servants said unto him: 'Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings; let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; peradventure he will save thy life.'
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said: 'Thy servant Ben-hadad saith: I pray thee, let me live.' And he said: 'Is he yet alive? he is my brother.'
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> Now the men took it for a sign, and hastened to catch it from him; and they said: 'Thy brother Ben-hadad.' Then he said: 'Go ye, bring him.' Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into his chariot.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> And [Ben-hadad] said unto him: 'The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.' 'And I[, said Ahab,] will let thee go with this covenant.' So he made a covenant with him, and let him go. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of the LORD: 'Smite me, I pray thee.' And the man refused to smite him.
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> Then said he unto him: 'Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.' And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him; and slew him.
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> Then he found another man, and said: 'Smite me, I pray thee.' And the man smote him, smiting and wounding him.
<A NAME="38"> </A>
<B>38</B> So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.
<A NAME="39"> </A>
<B>39</B> And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king; and he said: 'Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said: Keep this man; if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
<A NAME="40"> </A>
<B>40</B> And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone.' And the king of Israel said unto him: 'So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.'
<A NAME="41"> </A>
<B>41</B> And he hastened, and took the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
<A NAME="42"> </A>
<B>42</B> And he said unto him: 'Thus saith the LORD: Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.'
<A NAME="43"> </A>
<B>43</B> And the king of Israel went to his house sullen and displeased, and came to Samaria. <B>{P}</B></P>
