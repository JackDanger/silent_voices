<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Judges Chapter 8</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the men of Ephraim said unto him: 'Why hast thou served us thus, that thou didst not call us when thou wentest to fight with Midian?' And they did chide with him sharply.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And he said unto them: 'What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> God hath delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?' Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And he said unto the men of Succoth: 'Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And the princes of Succoth said: 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thine army?'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And Gideon said: 'Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke unto them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And he spoke also unto the men of Penuel, saying: 'When I come back in peace, I will break down this tower.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<P><B>10</B> Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the host of the children of the east; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him; and he wrote down for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said: 'Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying: Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?'
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And he broke down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna: 'Where are the men whom ye slew at Tabor?' And they answered: 'As thou art, so were they; of one form with the children of a king.'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And he said: 'They were my brethren, the sons of my mother; as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And he said unto Jether his first-born: 'Up, and slay them.' But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said: 'Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength.' And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels' necks. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<P><B>22</B> Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon: 'Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also; for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Midian.'
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And Gideon said unto them: 'I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you.'
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And Gideon said unto them: 'I would make a request of you, that ye would give me every man the ear-rings of his spoil.'--For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And they answered: 'We will willingly give them.' And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah; and all Israel went astray after it there; and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<P><B>29</B> And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten; for he had many wives.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimelech.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<P><B>33</B> And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel again went astray after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown unto Israel. <B>{P}</B></P>
