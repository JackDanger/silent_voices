<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Job Chapter 20</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> <B>{S}</B> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said:<BR>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, even by reason of mine agitation that is in me.<BR>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame, but out of my understanding my spirit answereth me.<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Knowest thou not this of old time, since man was placed upon earth,<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment?<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;<BR>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung; they that have seen him shall say: 'Where is he?'<BR>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found; yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> The eye which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.<BR>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> His children shall appease the poor, and his hands shall restore his wealth.<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> His bones are full of his youth, but it shall lie down with him in the dust.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth;<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Yet his food in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God shall cast them out of his belly.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> He shall suck the poison of asps; the viper's tongue shall slay him.<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> He shall not look upon the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and curd.<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> That which he laboured for shall he give back, and shall not swallow it down; according to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; he hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Because he knew no quietness within him, in his greed he suffered nought to escape,<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> There was nothing left that he devoured not--therefore his prosperity shall not endure.<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits; the hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> It shall be for the filling of his belly; He shall cast the fierceness of His wrath upon him, and shall cause it to rain upon him into his flesh.<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> If he flee from the iron weapon, the bow of brass shall strike him through.<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall; terrors are upon him.<BR>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> All darkness is laid up for his treasures; <B>{N}</B><BR>a fire not blown by man shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tent.<BR>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him.<BR>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> The increase of his house shall depart, his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.<BR>
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.</P>
