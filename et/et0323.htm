<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: The appointed seasons of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My appointed seasons.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work; it is a sabbath unto the LORD in all your dwellings. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<P><B>4</B> These are the appointed seasons of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at dusk, is the LORD'S passover.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD; seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days; in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<P><B>9</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses saying:
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you; on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering unto the LORD.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the offering of your God; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the day of rest, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the waving; seven weeks shall there be complete;
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> even unto the morrow after the seventh week shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall present a new meal-offering unto the LORD.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Ye shall bring out of your dwellings two wave-loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, for first-fruits unto the LORD.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams; they shall be a burnt-offering unto the LORD, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before the LORD, with the two lambs; they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no manner of servile work; it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest; thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<P><B>23</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns, a holy convocation.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> Ye shall do no manner of servile work; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; there shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> Ye shall do no manner of work; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls; in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<P><B>33</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> On the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> Seven days ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD; on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD; it is a day of solemn assembly; ye shall do no manner of servile work.
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> These are the appointed seasons of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day;
<A NAME="38"> </A>
<B>38</B> beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.
<A NAME="39"> </A>
<B>39</B> Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of the LORD seven days; on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
<A NAME="40"> </A>
<B>40</B> And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook, and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.
<A NAME="41"> </A>
<B>41</B> And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year; it is a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month.
<A NAME="42"> </A>
<B>42</B> Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;
<A NAME="43"> </A>
<B>43</B> that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
<A NAME="44"> </A>
<B>44</B> And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
