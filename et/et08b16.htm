<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">2 Samuel Chapter 16</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And when David was a little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And the king said unto Ziba: 'What meanest thou by these?' And Ziba said: 'The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.'
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And the king said: 'And where is thy master's son?' And Ziba said unto the king: 'Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem; for he said: To-day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Then said the king to Ziba: 'Behold, thine is all that pertaineth unto Mephibosheth.' And Ziba said: 'I prostrate myself; let me find favour in thy sight, my lord, O king.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and kept on cursing as he came.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And thus said Shimei when he cursed: 'Begone, begone, thou man of blood, and base fellow;
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and, behold, thou art taken in thine own mischief, because thou art a man of blood.'
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king: 'Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And the king said: 'What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him: Curse David; who then shall say: Wherefore hast thou done so?' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants: 'Behold, my son, who came forth of my body, seeketh my life; how much more this Benjamite now? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> It may be that the LORD will look on mine eye, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing of me this day.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> So David and his men went by the way; <B>{S}</B> and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<P><B>14</B> And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom: 'Long live the king, long live the king.'
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And Absalom said to Hushai: 'Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And Hushai said unto Absalom: 'Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<P><B>20</B> Then said Absalom to Ahithophel: 'Give your counsel what we shall do.'
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And Ahithophel said unto Absalom: 'Go in unto thy father's concubines, that he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that thou art abhorred of thy father; then will the hands of all that are with thee be strong.'
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.--
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> Now the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man inquired of the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. <B>{S}</B></P>
