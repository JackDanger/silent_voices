<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> 'Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them; and they shall be unto thee for the calling of the congregation, and for causing the camps to set forward.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And when they shall blow with them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And if they blow but with one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall take their journey.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall set forward; they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> But when the assembly is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for a statute for ever throughout your generations.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And when ye go to war in your land against the adversary that oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Also in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="11"> </A>

<B>12</B> And the children of Israel set forward by their stages out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran.--

<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, set forward.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their hosts; and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And the Kohathites the bearers of the sanctuary set forward, that the tabernacle might be set up against their coming.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts; and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rearward of all the camps, set forward according to their hosts; and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

<B>28</B> Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their hosts.--And they set forward. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law: 'We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said: I will give it you; come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.'
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And he said unto him: 'I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.'
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> And he said: 'Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what good soever the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.'
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> And they set forward from the mount of the LORD three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting-place for them.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> And the cloud of the LORD was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said: 'Rise up, O LORD, and let Thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate Thee flee before Thee.'
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> And when it rested, he said: 'Return, O LORD, unto the ten thousands of the families of Israel.' <B>{P}</B></P>
