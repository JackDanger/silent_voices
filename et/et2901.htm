<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Ruth Chapter 1</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem in Judah went to sojourn in the field of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem in Judah. And they came into the field of Moab, and continued there.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And they took them wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth; and they dwelt there about ten years.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the field of Moab; for she had heard in the field of Moab how that the LORD had remembered His people in giving them bread.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law: 'Go, return each of you to her mother's house; the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.' Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And they said unto her: 'Nay, but we will return with thee unto thy people.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And Naomi said: 'Turn back, my daughters; why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Turn back, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say: I have hope, should I even have an husband to-night, and also bear sons;
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye shut yourselves off for them and have no husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of the LORD is gone forth against me.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved unto her.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And she said: 'Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god; return thou after thy sister-in-law.'
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And Ruth said: 'Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee; for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried; the LORD do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking unto her.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was astir concerning them, and the women said: 'Is this Naomi?'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And she said unto them: 'Call me not Naomi, call me Marah; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me back home empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?'
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the field of Moab--and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</P>
