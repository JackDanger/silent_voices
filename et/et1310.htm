<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Hosea Chapter 10</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Israel was a luxuriant vine, which put forth fruit freely: as his fruit increased, he increased his altars; the more goodly his land was, the more goodly were his pillars.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Their heart is divided; now shall they bear their guilt; He will break down their altars, He will spoil their pillars.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Surely now shall they say: 'We have no king; for we feared not the LORD; and the king, what can he do for us?'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> They speak words, they swear falsely, they make covenants; thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in dread for the calves of Beth-aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof shall tremble for it, for its glory, because it is departed from it.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> It also shall be carried unto Assyria, for a present to King Contentious; Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> As for Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> The high places also of Aven shall be destroyed, even the sin of Israel. The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains: 'Cover us', and to the hills: 'Fall on us.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<P><B>9</B> From the days of Gibeah thou hast sinned, O Israel; there they stood; no battle was to overtake them in Gibeah, nor the children of arrogancy.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> When it is My desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are yoked to their two rings.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And Ephraim is a heifer well broken, that loveth to thresh, and I have passed over upon her fair neck; I will make Ephraim to ride, Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Sow to yourselves according to righteousness, reap according to mercy, break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek the LORD, till He come and cause righteousness to rain upon you.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity, ye have eaten the fruit of lies; for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy hosts, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle; the mother was dashed in pieces with her children.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> So hath Beth-el done unto you because of your great wickedness; at daybreak is the king of Israel utterly cut off.</P>
