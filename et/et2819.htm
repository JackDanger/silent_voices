<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Proverbs Chapter 19</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity than he that is perverse in his lips and a fool at the same time.<BR>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.<BR>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> The foolishness of man perverteth his way; and his heart fretteth against the LORD.<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Wealth addeth many friends; but as for the poor, his friend separateth himself from him.<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> A false witness shall not be unpunished; and he that breatheth forth lies shall not escape.<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Many will entreat the favour of the liberal man; and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.<BR>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> All the brethren of the poor do hate him; how much more do his friends go far from him! He that pursueth words, they turn against him.<BR>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul; he that keepeth understanding shall find good.<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> A false witness shall not be unpunished; and he that breatheth forth lies shall perish. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<P><B>10</B> Luxury is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> It is the discretion of a man to be slow to anger, and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> A foolish son is the calamity of his father; and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> House and riches are the inheritance of fathers; but a prudent wife is from the LORD.<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and the idle soul shall suffer hunger.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul; but he that despiseth His ways shall die.<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> He that is gracious unto the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and his good deed will He repay unto him.<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Chasten thy son, for there is hope; but set not thy heart on his destruction.<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment; for if thou interpose, thou wilt add thereto.<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> There are many devices in a man's heart; but the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> The lust of a man is his shame; and a poor man is better than a liar.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> The fear of the LORD tendeth to life; and he that hath it shall abide satisfied, he shall not be visited with evil.<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish, and will not so much as bring it back to his mouth.<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> When thou smitest a scorner, the simple will become prudent; and when one that hath understanding is reproved, he will understand knowledge.<BR>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> A son that dealeth shamefully and reproachfully will despoil his father, and chase away his mother.<BR>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.<BR>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> An ungodly witness mocketh at right; and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.<BR>
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.</P>
