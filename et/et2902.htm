<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Ruth Chapter 2</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of valour, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi: 'Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find favour.' And she said unto her: 'Go, my daughter.'
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers: 'The LORD be with you.' And they answered him: 'The LORD bless thee.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers: 'Whose damsel is this?'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said: 'It is a Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the field of Moab;
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> and she said: Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves; so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Then said Boaz unto Ruth: 'Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them; have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Then she fell on her face, and bowed down to the ground, and said unto him: 'Why have I found favour in thy sight, that thou shouldest take cognizance of me, seeing I am a foreigner?'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And Boaz answered and said unto her: 'It hath fully been told me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> The LORD recompense thy work, and be thy reward complete from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Then she said: 'Let me find favour in thy sight, my LORD; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And Boaz said unto her at meal-time: 'Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.' And she sat beside the reapers; and they reached her parched corn, and she did eat and was satisfied, and left thereof.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying: 'Let her glean even among the sheaves, and put her not to shame.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And also pull out some for her of purpose from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.'
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was satisfied.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And her mother-in-law said unto her: 'Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.' And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said: 'The man's name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law: 'Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off His kindness to the living and to the dead.' And Naomi said unto her: 'The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.'
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And Ruth the Moabitess said: 'Yea, he said unto me: Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.'
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law: 'It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that thou be not met in any other field.'
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.</P>
