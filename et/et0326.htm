<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it; for I am the LORD your God.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary: I am the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<P><B>3</B> If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them;
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield her produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread until ye have enough, and dwell in your land safely.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you; and will establish My covenant with you.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old from before the new.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And I will set My tabernacle among you, and My soul shall not abhor you.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be My people.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> I am the LORD your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<P><B>14</B> But if ye will not hearken unto Me, and will not do all these commandments;
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> and if ye shall reject My statutes, and if your soul abhor Mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all My commandments, but break My covenant;
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall make the eyes to fail, and the soul to languish; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And I will set My face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies; they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto Me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield her produce, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And if ye walk contrary unto Me, and will not hearken unto Me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And if in spite of these things ye will not be corrected unto Me, but will walk contrary unto Me;
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities; and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And if ye will not for all this hearken unto Me, but walk contrary unto Me;
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> then I will walk contrary unto you in fury; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-pillars, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols; and My soul shall abhor you.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you; and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> Then shall the land be paid her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and repay her sabbaths.
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest; even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth; and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
<A NAME="38"> </A>
<B>38</B> And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
<A NAME="39"> </A>
<B>39</B> And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
<A NAME="40"> </A>
<B>40</B> And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their treachery which they committed against Me, and also that they have walked contrary unto Me.
<A NAME="41"> </A>
<B>41</B> I also will walk contrary unto them, and bring them into the land of their enemies; if then perchance their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then be paid the punishment of their iniquity;
<A NAME="42"> </A>
<B>42</B> then will I remember My covenant with Jacob, and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
<A NAME="43"> </A>
<B>43</B> For the land shall lie forsaken without them, and shall be paid her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them; and they shall be paid the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected Mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred My statutes.
<A NAME="44"> </A>
<B>44</B> And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God.
<A NAME="45"> </A>
<B>45</B> But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.
<A NAME="46"> </A>
<B>46</B> These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which the LORD made between Him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses. <B>{P}</B></P>
