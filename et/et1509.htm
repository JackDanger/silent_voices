<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Amos Chapter 9</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> I saw the Lord standing beside the altar; and He said: Smite the capitals, that the posts may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the residue of them with the sword; there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Though they dig into the nether-world, thence shall My hand take them; and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from My sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them; and I will set Mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> For the Lord, the GOD of hosts, is He that toucheth the land and it melteth, and all that dwell therein mourn; and it riseth up wholly like the River, and sinketh again, like the River of Egypt;
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> It is He that buildeth His upper chambers in the heaven, and hath founded His vault upon the earth; He that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; The LORD is His name.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto Me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword, that say: 'The evil shall not overtake nor confront us.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof, and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations, upon whom My name is called, saith the LORD that doeth this. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<P><B>13</B> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And I will turn the captivity of My people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God. <B>{P}</B></P>
