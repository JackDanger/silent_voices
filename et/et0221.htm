<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Exodus Chapter 21</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve; and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> If his master give him a wife, and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> But if the servant shall plainly say: I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free;
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed; to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> If he take him another wife, her food, her raiment, and her conjugal rights, shall he not diminish.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And if a man lie not in wait, but God cause it to come to hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he may flee. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from Mine altar, that he may die. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And he that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed;
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And if a man smite his bondman, or his bondwoman, with a rod, and he die under his hand, he shall surely be punished.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Notwithstanding if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he is his money. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow, he shall be surely fined, according as the woman's husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life,
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And if a man smite the eye of his bondman, or the eye of his bondwoman, and destroy it, he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And if he smite out his bondman's tooth, or his bondwoman's tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<P><B>28</B> And if an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and warning hath been given to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> If the ox gore a bondman or a bondwoman, he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein,
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner of them, and the dead beast shall be his. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> And if one man's ox hurt another's, so that it dieth; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it; and the dead also they shall divide.
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath not kept it in; he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead beast shall be his own. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> If a man steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.</P>
