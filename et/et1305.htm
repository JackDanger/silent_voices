<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Hosea Chapter 5</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Hear this, O ye priests, and attend, ye house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king, for unto you pertaineth the judgment; for ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And they that fall away are gone deep in making slaughter; and I am rejected of them all.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> I, even I, know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from Me; for now, O Ephraim, thou hast committed harlotry, Israel is defiled.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Their doings will not suffer them to return unto their God; for the spirit of harlotry is within them, and they know not the LORD.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> But the pride of Israel shall testify to his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity, Judah also shall stumble with them.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> With their flocks and with their herds they shall go to seek the LORD, but they shall not find Him; He hath withdrawn Himself from them.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> They have dealt treacherously against the LORD, for they have begotten strange children; now shall the new moon devour them with their portions. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Blow ye the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah; sound an alarm at Beth-aven: 'Behind thee, O Benjamin!'
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke; among the tribes of Israel do I make known that which shall surely be.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark; I will pour out My wrath upon them like water.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Oppressed is Ephraim, crushed in his right; because he willingly walked after filth.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And when Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to King Contentious; but he is not able to heal you, neither shall he cure you of your wound.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah; I, even I, will tear and go away, I will take away, and there shall be none to deliver.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> I will go and return to My place, till they acknowledge their guilt, and seek My face; in their trouble they will seek Me earnestly:</P>
