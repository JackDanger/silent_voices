<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Hosea Chapter 7</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> when I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria, for they commit falsehood; and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers maketh a raid without.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And let them not say to their heart--I remember all their wickedness; now their own doings have beset them about, they are before My face.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth to stir from the kneading of the dough until it be leavened.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> On the day of our king the princes make him sick with the heat of wine, he stretcheth out his hand with scorners.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait; their baker sleepeth all the night, in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen, there is none among them that calleth unto Me.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Ephraim, he mixeth himself with the peoples; Ephraim is become a cake not turned.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not; yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth it not.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face; but they have not returned unto the LORD their God, nor sought Him, for all this.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And Ephraim is become like a silly dove, without understanding; they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Even as they go, I will spread My net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath been made to hear. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Woe unto them! for they have strayed from Me; Destruction unto them! for they have transgressed against Me; Shall I then redeem them, seeing they have spoken lies against Me?
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And they have not cried unto Me with their heart, though they wail upon their beds; they assemble themselves for corn and wine, they rebel against Me.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Though I have trained and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise evil against Me.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> They return, but not upwards; they are become like a deceitful bow; their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue; this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</P>
