<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Exodus Chapter 5</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh: 'Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Let My people go, that they may hold a feast unto Me in the wilderness.'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And Pharaoh said: 'Who is the LORD, that I should hearken unto His voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, and moreover I will not let Israel go.'
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And they said: 'The God of the Hebrews hath met with us. Let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And the king of Egypt said unto them: 'Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, cause the people to break loose from their work? get you unto your burdens.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And Pharaoh said: 'Behold, the people of the land are now many, and will ye make them rest from their burdens?'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying:
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> 'Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof; for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying: Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard lying words.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying: 'Thus saith Pharaoh: I will not give you straw.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it; for nought of your work shall be diminished.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And the taskmasters were urgent, saying: 'Fulfil your work, your daily task, as when there was straw.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, saying: 'Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your appointed task in making brick both yesterday and today as heretofore?'
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying: 'Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us: Make brick; and, behold, thy servants are beaten, but the fault is in thine own people.'
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> But he said: 'Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore ye say: Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were set on mischief, when they said: 'Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, your daily task.'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh;
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> and they said unto them: 'The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.'
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said: 'Lord, wherefore hast Thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that Thou hast sent me?
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast Thou delivered Thy people at all.'</P>
