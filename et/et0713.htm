<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Judges Chapter 13</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<P><B>2</B> And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her: 'Behold now, thou art barren, and hast not borne; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb; and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Then the woman came and told her husband, saying: 'A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name;
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> but he said unto me: Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<P><B>8</B> Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said: 'Oh, LORD, I pray Thee, let the man of God whom Thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.'
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him: 'Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me that day.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him: 'Art thou the man that spokest unto the woman?' And he said: 'I am.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And Manoah said: 'Now when thy word cometh to pass, what shall be the rule for the child, and what shall be done with him?'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah: 'Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the grapevine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD: 'I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.'
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah: 'Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD.' For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of the LORD.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD: 'What is thy name, that when thy words come to pass we may do thee honour?'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And the angel of the LORD said unto him: 'Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is hidden?' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<P><B>19</B> So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto the LORD; and [the angel] did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar; and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the LORD.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And Manoah said unto his wife: 'We shall surely die, because we have seen God.'
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> But his wife said unto him: 'If the LORD were pleased to kill us, He would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would He have shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.'
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson; and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And the spirit of the LORD began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol. <B>{P}</B></P>
