<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Judges Chapter 4</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And the LORD gave them over into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth-goiim.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<P><B>4</B> Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And she sat under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Beth-el in the hill-country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him: 'Hath not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded, saying: Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And I will draw unto thee to the brook Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Barak said unto her: 'If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.'
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And she said: 'I will surely go with thee; notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thy honour; for the LORD will give Sisera over into the hand of a woman.' And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet; and Deborah went up with him.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as Elon-bezaanannim, which is by Kedesh.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth-goiim, unto the brook Kishon.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And Deborah said unto Barak: 'Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thy hand; is not the LORD gone out before thee?' So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth-goiim; and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him: 'Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not.' And he turned in unto her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And he said unto her: 'Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.' And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And he said unto her: 'Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say: Is there any man here? that thou shalt say: No.'
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him: 'Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest.' And he came unto her; and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan. <B>{P}</B></P>
