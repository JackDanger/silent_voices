<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Proverbs Chapter 8</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Doth not wisdom call, and understanding put forth her voice?<BR>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> In the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet, she standeth;<BR>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> 'Unto you, O men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of men.<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> O ye thoughtless, understand prudence, and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Hear, for I will speak excellent things, and the opening of my lips shall be right things.<BR>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> For my mouth shall utter truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.<BR>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness, there is nothing perverse or crooked in them.<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.<BR>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Receive my instruction, and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> For wisdom is better than rubies, and all things desirable are not to be compared unto her.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of devices.<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; <B>{N}</B><BR>pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine.<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> I love them that love me, and those that seek me earnestly shall find me.<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Riches and honour are with me; yea, enduring riches and righteousness.<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my produce than choice silver.<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice;<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, and that I may fill their treasuries.<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> The LORD made me as the beginning of His way, the first of His works of old.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth;<BR>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> While as yet He had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.<BR>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> When He established the heavens, I was there; when He set a circle upon the face of the deep,<BR>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> When He made firm the skies above, when the fountains of the deep showed their might,<BR>
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> When He gave to the sea His decree, that the waters should not transgress His commandment, when He appointed the foundations of the earth;<BR>
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> Then I was by Him, as a nursling; and I was daily all delight, playing always before Him,<BR>
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> Playing in His habitable earth, and my delights are with the sons of men. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<P><B>32</B> Now therefore, ye children, hearken unto me; for happy are they that keep my ways.<BR>
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.<BR>
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> Happy is the man that hearkeneth to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.<BR>
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> For whoso findeth me findeth life, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.<BR>
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> But he that misseth me wrongeth his own soul; all they that hate me love death.'</P>
