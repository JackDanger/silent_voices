<P><B>1,1</B> Happy is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked, <B>{N}</B><BR>nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful.<BR>
<B>1,2</B> But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in His law doth he meditate day and night.<BR>
<B>1,3</B> And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, <B>{N}</B><BR>that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf doth not wither; and in whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper.<BR>
<B>1,4</B> Not so the wicked; but they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.<BR>
<B>1,5</B> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<BR>
<B>1,6</B> For the LORD regardeth the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked shall perish. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>2,1</B> Why are the nations in an uproar? And why do the peoples mutter in vain?<BR>
<B>2,2</B> The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together, <B>{N}</B><BR>against the LORD, and against His anointed:<BR>
<B>2,3</B> 'Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.'<BR>
<B>2,4</B> He that sitteth in heaven laugheth, the Lord hath them in derision.<BR>
<B>2,5</B> Then will He speak unto them in His wrath, and affright them in His sore displeasure:<BR>
<B>2,6</B> 'Truly it is I that have established My king upon Zion, My holy mountain.'<BR>
<B>2,7</B> I will tell of the decree: the LORD said unto me: 'Thou art My son, this day have I begotten thee.<BR>
<B>2,8</B> Ask of Me, and I will give the nations for thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy possession.<BR>
<B>2,9</B> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.'<BR>
<B>2,10</B> Now therefore, O ye kings, be wise; be admonished, ye judges of the earth.<BR>
<B>2,11</B> Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.<BR>
<B>2,12</B> Do homage in purity, lest He be angry, and ye perish in the way, when suddenly His wrath is kindled. <B>{N}</B><BR>Happy are all they that take refuge in Him. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>3,1</B> A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.<BR>
<B>3,2</B> LORD, how many are mine adversaries become! Many are they that rise up against me.<BR>
<B>3,3</B> Many there are that say of my soul: 'There is no salvation for him in God.' Selah<BR>
<B>3,4</B> But thou, O LORD, art a shield about me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head.<BR>
<B>3,5</B> With my voice I call unto the LORD, and He answereth me out of His holy mountain. Selah<BR>
<B>3,6</B> I lay me down, and I sleep; I awake, for the LORD sustaineth me.<BR>
<B>3,7</B> I am not afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.<BR>
<B>3,8</B> Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God; for Thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek, <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.<BR>
<B>3,9</B> Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; Thy blessing be upon Thy people. Selah <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>4,1</B> For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>4,2</B> Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness, Thou who didst set me free when I was in distress; be gracious unto me, and hear my prayer.<BR>
<B>4,3</B> O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be put to shame, in that ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah<BR>
<B>4,4</B> But know that the LORD hath set apart the godly man as His own; the LORD will hear when I call unto Him.<BR>
<B>4,5</B> Tremble, and sin not; commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah<BR>
<B>4,6</B> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.<BR>
<B>4,7</B> Many there are that say: 'Oh that we could see some good!' LORD, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us.<BR>
<B>4,8</B> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than when their corn and their wine increase.<BR>
<B>4,9</B> In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; for Thou, LORD, makest me dwell alone in safety. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>5,1</B> For the Leader; upon the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>5,2</B> Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.<BR>
<B>5,3</B> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; for unto Thee do I pray.<BR>
<B>5,4</B> O LORD, in the morning shalt Thou hear my voice; in the morning will I order my prayer unto Thee, and will look forward.<BR>
<B>5,5</B> For Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; evil shall not sojourn with Thee.<BR>
<B>5,6</B> The boasters shall not stand in Thy sight; Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.<BR>
<B>5,7</B> Thou destroyest them that speak falsehood; the LORD abhorreth the man of blood and of deceit.<BR>
<B>5,8</B> But as for me, in the abundance of Thy lovingkindness will I come into Thy house; I will bow down toward Thy holy temple in the fear of Thee.<BR>
<B>5,9</B> O LORD, lead me in Thy righteousness because of them that lie in wait for me; make Thy way straight before my face.<BR>
<B>5,10</B> For there is no sincerity in their mouth; their inward part is a yawning gulf, their throat is an open sepulchre; they make smooth their tongue.<BR>
<B>5,11</B> Hold them guilty, O God, let them fall by their own counsels; <B>{N}</B><BR>cast them down in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against Thee.<BR>
<B>5,12</B> So shall all those that take refuge in Thee rejoice, they shall ever shout for joy, and Thou shalt shelter them; <B>{N}</B><BR>let them also that love Thy name exult in Thee.<BR>
<B>5,13</B> For Thou dost bless the righteous; O LORD, Thou dost encompass him with favour as with a shield. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>6,1</B> For the Leader; with string-music; on the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>6,2</B> O LORD, rebuke me not in Thine anger, neither chasten me in Thy wrath.<BR>
<B>6,3</B> Be gracious unto me, O LORD, for I languish away; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are affrighted.<BR>
<B>6,4</B> My soul also is sore affrighted; and Thou, O LORD, how long?<BR>
<B>6,5</B> Return, O LORD, deliver my soul; save me for Thy mercy's sake.<BR>
<B>6,6</B> For in death there is no remembrance of Thee; in the nether-world who will give Thee thanks?<BR>
<B>6,7</B> I am weary with my groaning; every night make I my bed to swim; I melt away my couch with my tears.<BR>
<B>6,8</B> Mine eye is dimmed because of vexation; it waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.<BR>
<B>6,9</B> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.<BR>
<B>6,10</B> The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD receiveth my prayer.<BR>
<B>6,11</B> All mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore affrighted; they shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>7,1</B> Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning Cush a Benjamite.<BR>
<B>7,2</B> O LORD my God, in Thee have I taken refuge; save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me;<BR>
<B>7,3</B> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.<BR>
<B>7,4</B> O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;<BR>
<B>7,5</B> If I have requited him that did evil unto me, or spoiled mine adversary unto emptiness;<BR>
<B>7,6</B> Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it, and tread my life down to the earth; yea, let him lay my glory in the dust. Selah<BR>
<B>7,7</B> Arise, O LORD, in Thine anger, lift up Thyself in indignation against mine adversaries; yea, awake for me at the judgment which Thou hast commanded.<BR>
<B>7,8</B> And let the congregation of the peoples compass Thee about, and over them return Thou on high.<BR>
<B>7,9</B> O LORD, who ministerest judgment to the peoples, judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.<BR>
<B>7,10</B> Oh that a full measure of evil might come upon the wicked, and that Thou wouldest establish the righteous; <B>{N}</B><BR>for the righteous God trieth the heart and reins.<BR>
<B>7,11</B> My shield is with God, who saveth the upright in heart.<BR>
<B>7,12</B> God is a righteous judge, yea, a God that hath indignation every day:<BR>
<B>7,13</B> If a man turn not, He will whet His sword, He hath bent His bow, and made it ready;<BR>
<B>7,14</B> He hath also prepared for him the weapons of death, yea, His arrows which He made sharp.<BR>
<B>7,15</B> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; yea, he conceiveth mischief, and bringeth forth falsehood.<BR>
<B>7,16</B> He hath digged a pit, and hollowed it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.<BR>
<B>7,17</B> His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own pate.<BR>
<B>7,18</B> I will give thanks unto the LORD according to His righteousness; and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>8,1</B> For the Leader; upon the Gittith. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>8,2</B> O LORD, our Lord, how glorious is Thy name in all the earth! <B>{N}</B><BR>whose majesty is rehearsed above the heavens.<BR>
<B>8,3</B> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou founded strength, <B>{N}</B><BR>because of Thine adversaries; that Thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.<BR>
<B>8,4</B> When I behold Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, <B>{N}</B><BR>the moon and the stars, which Thou hast established;<BR>
<B>8,5</B> What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that Thou thinkest of him?<BR>
<B>8,6</B> Yet Thou hast made him but little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.<BR>
<B>8,7</B> Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet:<BR>
<B>8,8</B> Sheep and oxen, all of them, yea, and the beasts of the field;<BR>
<B>8,9</B> The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea; whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.<BR>
<B>8,10</B> O LORD, our Lord, how glorious is Thy name in all the earth! <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>9,1</B> For the Leader; upon Muthlabben. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>9,2</B> I will give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart; I will tell of all Thy marvellous works.<BR>
<B>9,3</B> I will be glad and exult in Thee; I will sing praise to Thy name, O Most High:<BR>
<B>9,4</B> When mine enemies are turned back, they stumble and perish at Thy presence;<BR>
<B>9,5</B> For Thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sattest upon the throne as the righteous Judge.<BR>
<B>9,6</B> Thou hast rebuked the nations, Thou hast destroyed the wicked, Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.<BR>
<B>9,7</B> O thou enemy, the waste places are come to an end for ever; and the cities which thou didst uproot, their very memorial is perished.<BR>
<B>9,8</B> But the LORD is enthroned for ever; He hath established His throne for judgment.<BR>
<B>9,9</B> And He will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples with equity.<BR>
<B>9,10</B> The LORD also will be a high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble;<BR>
<B>9,11</B> And they that know Thy name will put their trust in Thee; for Thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek Thee.<BR>
<B>9,12</B> Sing praises to the LORD, who dwelleth in Zion; declare among the peoples His doings.<BR>
<B>9,13</B> For He that avengeth blood hath remembered them; He hath not forgotten the cry of the humble.<BR>
<B>9,14</B> Be gracious unto me, O LORD, behold mine affliction at the hands of them that hate me; Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;<BR>
<B>9,15</B> That I may tell of all Thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion, that I may rejoice in Thy salvation.<BR>
<B>9,16</B> The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made; in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.<BR>
<B>9,17</B> The LORD hath made Himself known, He hath executed judgment, the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah<BR>
<B>9,18</B> The wicked shall return to the nether-world, even all the nations that forget God.<BR>
<B>9,19</B> For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.<BR>
<B>9,20</B> Arise, O LORD, let not man prevail; let the nations be judged in Thy sight.<BR>
<B>9,21</B> Set terror over them, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men. Selah <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>10,1</B> Why standest Thou afar off, O LORD? Why hidest Thou Thyself in times of trouble?<BR>
<B>10,2</B> Through the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued, they are taken in the devices that they have imagined.<BR>
<B>10,3</B> For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and the covetous vaunteth himself, though he contemn the LORD.<BR>
<B>10,4</B> The wicked, in the pride of his countenance [, saith]: 'He will not require'; all his thoughts are: 'There is no God.'<BR>
<B>10,5</B> His ways prosper at all times; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight; as for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.<BR>
<B>10,6</B> He saith in his heart: 'I shall not be moved, I who to all generations shall not be in adversity.'<BR>
<B>10,7</B> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.<BR>
<B>10,8</B> He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; in secret places doth he slay the innocent; his eyes are on the watch for the helpless.<BR>
<B>10,9</B> He lieth in wait in a secret place as a lion in his lair, he lieth in wait to catch the poor; <B>{N}</B><BR>he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him up in his net.<BR>
<B>10,10</B> He croucheth, he boweth down, and the helpless fall into his mighty claws.<BR>
<B>10,11</B> He hath said in his heart: 'God hath forgotten; He hideth His face; He will never see.'<BR>
<B>10,12</B> Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up Thy hand; forget not the humble.<BR>
<B>10,13</B> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, and say in his heart: 'Thou wilt not require'?<BR>
<B>10,14</B> Thou hast seen; for Thou beholdest trouble and vexation, to requite them with Thy hand; <B>{N}</B><BR>unto Thee the helpless committeth himself; Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.<BR>
<B>10,15</B> Break Thou the arm of the wicked; and as for the evil man, search out his wickedness, till none be found.<BR>
<B>10,16</B> The LORD is King for ever and ever; the nations are perished out of His land.<BR>
<B>10,17</B> LORD, Thou hast heard the desire of the humble: Thou wilt direct their heart, Thou wilt cause Thine ear to attend;<BR>
<B>10,18</B> To right the fatherless and the oppressed, that man who is of the earth may be terrible no more. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>11,1</B> For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David. <B>{N}</B><BR>In the LORD have I taken refuge; how say ye to my soul: 'Flee thou! to your mountain, ye birds'?<BR>
<B>11,2</B> For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, they have made ready their arrow upon the string, <B>{N}</B><BR>that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.<BR>
<B>11,3</B> When the foundations are destroyed, what hath the righteous wrought?<BR>
<B>11,4</B> The LORD is in His holy temple, the LORD, His throne is in heaven; <B>{N}</B><BR>His eyes behold, His eyelids try, the children of men.<BR>
<B>11,5</B> The LORD trieth the righteous; but the wicked and him that loveth violence His soul hateth.<BR>
<B>11,6</B> Upon the wicked He will cause to rain coals; fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.<BR>
<B>11,7</B> For the LORD is righteous, He loveth righteousness; the upright shall behold His face. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>12,1</B> For the Leader; on the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>12,2</B> Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.<BR>
<B>12,3</B> They speak falsehood every one with his neighbour; with flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak.<BR>
<B>12,4</B> May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh proud things!<BR>
<B>12,5</B> Who have said: 'Our tongue will we make mighty; our lips are with us: who is lord over us?'<BR>
<B>12,6</B> 'For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, <B>{N}</B><BR>now will I arise', saith the LORD; 'I will set him in safety at whom they puff.'<BR>
<B>12,7</B> The words of the LORD are pure words, <B>{N}</B><BR>as silver tried in a crucible on the earth, refined seven times.<BR>
<B>12,8</B> Thou wilt keep them, O LORD; Thou wilt preserve us from this generation for ever.<BR>
<B>12,9</B> The wicked walk on every side, when vileness is exalted among the sons of men. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>13,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>13,2</B> How long, O LORD, wilt Thou forget me for ever? How long wilt Thou hide Thy face from me?<BR>
<B>13,3</B> How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart by day? <B>{N}</B><BR>How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?<BR>
<B>13,4</B> Behold Thou, and answer me, O LORD my God; lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;<BR>
<B>13,5</B> Lest mine enemy say: 'I have prevailed against him'; lest mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved.<BR>
<B>13,6</B> But as for me, in Thy mercy do I trust; my heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation. <B>{N}</B><BR>I will sing unto the LORD, because He hath dealt bountifully with me. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>14,1</B> For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David. <B>{N}</B><BR>The fool hath said in his heart: 'There is no God'; <B>{N}</B><BR>they have dealt corruptly, they have done abominably; there is none that doeth good.<BR>
<B>14,2</B> The LORD looked forth from heaven upon the children of men, <B>{N}</B><BR>to see if there were any man of understanding, that did seek after God.<BR>
<B>14,3</B> They are all corrupt, they are together become impure; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<BR>
<B>14,4</B> 'Shall not all the workers of iniquity know it, who eat up My people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD?'<BR>
<B>14,5</B> There are they in great fear; for God is with the righteous generation.<BR>
<B>14,6</B> Ye would put to shame the counsel of the poor, but the LORD is his refuge.<BR>
<B>14,7</B> Oh that the salvation of Israel <B>{N}</B><BR>were come out of Zion! When the LORD turneth the captivity of His people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>15,1</B> A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell upon Thy holy mountain?<BR>
<B>15,2</B> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh truth in his heart;<BR>
<B>15,3</B> That hath no slander upon his tongue, nor doeth evil to his fellow, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour;<BR>
<B>15,4</B> In whose eyes a vile person is despised, but he honoureth them that fear the LORD; <B>{N}</B><BR>he that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;<BR>
<B>15,5</B> He that putteth not out his money on interest, nor taketh a bribe against the innocent. <B>{N}</B><BR>He that doeth these things shall never be moved. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>16,1</B> Michtam of David. Keep me, O God; for I have taken refuge in Thee.<BR>
<B>16,2</B> I have said unto the LORD: 'Thou art my Lord; I have no good but in Thee';<BR>
<B>16,3</B> As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all my delight.<BR>
<B>16,4</B> Let the idols of them be multiplied that make suit unto another; <B>{N}</B><BR>their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take their names upon my lips.<BR>
<B>16,5</B> O LORD, the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup, Thou maintainest my lot.<BR>
<B>16,6</B> The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.<BR>
<B>16,7</B> I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel; yea, in the night seasons my reins instruct me.<BR>
<B>16,8</B> I have set the LORD always before me; surely He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.<BR>
<B>16,9</B> Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also dwelleth in safety;<BR>
<B>16,10</B> For Thou wilt not abandon my soul to the nether-world; neither wilt Thou suffer Thy godly one to see the pit.<BR>
<B>16,11</B> Thou makest me to know the path of life; <B>{N}</B><BR>in Thy presence is fulness of joy, in Thy right hand bliss for evermore. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>17,1</B> A Prayer of David. <B>{N}</B><BR>Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry; give ear unto my prayer <B>{N}</B><BR>from lips without deceit.<BR>
<B>17,2</B> Let my judgment come forth from Thy presence; let Thine eyes behold equity.<BR>
<B>17,3</B> Thou hast tried my heart, Thou hast visited it in the night; Thou hast tested me, and Thou findest not <B>{N}</B><BR>that I had a thought which should not pass my mouth.<BR>
<B>17,4</B> As for the doings of men, by the word of Thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent.<BR>
<B>17,5</B> My steps have held fast to Thy paths, my feet have not slipped.<BR>
<B>17,6</B> As for me, I call upon Thee, for Thou wilt answer me, O God; incline Thine ear unto me, hear my speech.<BR>
<B>17,7</B> Make passing great Thy mercies, O Thou that savest by Thy right hand from assailants them that take refuge in Thee.<BR>
<B>17,8</B> Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me in the shadow of Thy wings,<BR>
<B>17,9</B> From the wicked that oppress, my deadly enemies, that compass me about.<BR>
<B>17,10</B> Their gross heart they have shut tight, with their mouth they speak proudly.<BR>
<B>17,11</B> At our every step they have now encompassed us; they set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.<BR>
<B>17,12</B> He is like a lion that is eager to tear in pieces, and like a young lion lurking in secret places.<BR>
<B>17,13</B> Arise, O LORD, confront him, cast him down; <B>{N}</B><BR>deliver my soul from the wicked, by Thy sword;<BR>
<B>17,14</B> From men, by Thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, <B>{N}</B><BR>whose portion is in this life, and whose belly Thou fillest with Thy treasure; <B>{N}</B><BR>who have children in plenty, and leave their abundance to their babes.<BR>
<B>17,15</B> As for me, I shall behold Thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>18,1</B> For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David the servant of the LORD, <B>{N}</B><BR>who spoke unto the LORD the words of this song <B>{N}</B><BR>in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul;<BR>
<B>18,2</B> And he said: I love thee, O LORD, my strength.<BR>
<B>18,3</B> The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; <B>{N}</B><BR>my God, my rock, in Him I take refuge; my shield, and my horn of salvation, my high tower.<BR>
<B>18,4</B> Praised, I cry, is the LORD, and I am saved from mine enemies.<BR>
<B>18,5</B> The cords of Death compassed me, and the floods of Belial assailed me.<BR>
<B>18,6</B> The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of Death confronted me.<BR>
<B>18,7</B> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God; <B>{N}</B><BR>out of His temple He heard my voice, and my cry came before Him unto His ears.<BR>
<B>18,8</B> Then the earth did shake and quake, the foundations also of the mountains did tremble; <B>{N}</B><BR>they were shaken, because He was wroth.<BR>
<B>18,9</B> Smoke arose up in His nostrils, and fire out of His mouth did devour; <B>{N}</B><BR>coals flamed forth from Him.<BR>
<B>18,10</B> He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and thick darkness was under His feet.<BR>
<B>18,11</B> And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, He did swoop down upon the wings of the wind.<BR>
<B>18,12</B> He made darkness His hiding-place, His pavilion round about Him; <B>{N}</B><BR>darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.<BR>
<B>18,13</B> At the brightness before Him, there passed through His thick clouds hailstones and coals of fire.<BR>
<B>18,14</B> The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High gave forth His voice; hailstones and coals of fire.<BR>
<B>18,15</B> And He sent out His arrows, and scattered them; and He shot forth lightnings, and discomfited them.<BR>
<B>18,16</B> And the channels of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid bare, <B>{N}</B><BR>at Thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of Thy nostrils.<BR>
<B>18,17</B> He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters.<BR>
<B>18,18</B> He delivered me from mine enemy most strong, and from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.<BR>
<B>18,19</B> They confronted me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was a stay unto me.<BR>
<B>18,20</B> He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because He delighted in me.<BR>
<B>18,21</B> The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me.<BR>
<B>18,22</B> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.<BR>
<B>18,23</B> For all His ordinances were before me, and I put not away His statutes from me.<BR>
<B>18,24</B> And I was single-hearted with Him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.<BR>
<B>18,25</B> Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.<BR>
<B>18,26</B> With the merciful Thou dost show Thyself merciful, with the upright man Thou dost show Thyself upright;<BR>
<B>18,27</B> With the pure Thou dost show Thyself pure; and with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle.<BR>
<B>18,28</B> For Thou dost save the afflicted people; but the haughty eyes Thou dost humble.<BR>
<B>18,29</B> For Thou dost light my lamp; the LORD my God doth lighten my darkness.<BR>
<B>18,30</B> For by Thee I run upon a troop; and by my God do I scale a wall.<BR>
<B>18,31</B> As for God, His way is perfect; <B>{N}</B><BR>the word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in Him.<BR>
<B>18,32</B> For who is God, save the LORD? And who is a Rock, except our God?<BR>
<B>18,33</B> The God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way straight;<BR>
<B>18,34</B> Who maketh my feet like hinds', and setteth me upon my high places;<BR>
<B>18,35</B> Who traineth my hands for war, so that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.<BR>
<B>18,36</B> Thou hast also given me Thy shield of salvation, and Thy right hand hath holden me up; and Thy condescension hath made me great.<BR>
<B>18,37</B> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, and my feet have not slipped.<BR>
<B>18,38</B> I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them; neither did I turn back till they were consumed.<BR>
<B>18,39</B> I have smitten them through, so that they are not able to rise; they are fallen under my feet.<BR>
<B>18,40</B> For Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.<BR>
<B>18,41</B> Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me, and I did cut off them that hate me.<BR>
<B>18,42</B> They cried, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but He answered them not.<BR>
<B>18,43</B> Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.<BR>
<B>18,44</B> Thou hast delivered me from the contentions of the people; Thou hast made me the head of the nations; a people whom I have not known serve me.<BR>
<B>18,45</B> As soon as they hear of me, they obey me; the sons of the stranger dwindle away before me.<BR>
<B>18,46</B> The sons of the stranger fade away, and come trembling out of their close places.<BR>
<B>18,47</B> The LORD liveth, and blessed be my Rock; and exalted be the God of my salvation;<BR>
<B>18,48</B> Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, and subdueth peoples under me.<BR>
<B>18,49</B> He delivereth me from mine enemies; yea, Thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.<BR>
<B>18,50</B> Therefore I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD, among the nations, and will sing praises unto Thy name.<BR>
<B>18,51</B> Great salvation giveth He to His king; <B>{N}</B><BR>and showeth mercy to His anointed, to David and to his seed, for evermore. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>19,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>19,2</B> The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork;<BR>
<B>19,3</B> Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night revealeth knowledge;<BR>
<B>19,4</B> There is no speech, there are no words, neither is their voice heard.<BR>
<B>19,5</B> Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. <B>{N}</B><BR>In them hath He set a tent for the sun,<BR>
<B>19,6</B> Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course.<BR>
<B>19,7</B> His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.<BR>
<B>19,8</B> The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.<BR>
<B>19,9</B> The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.<BR>
<B>19,10</B> The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever; the ordinances of the LORD are true, they are righteous altogether;<BR>
<B>19,11</B> More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.<BR>
<B>19,12</B> Moreover by them is Thy servant warned; in keeping of them there is great reward.<BR>
<B>19,13</B> Who can discern his errors? Clear Thou me from hidden faults.<BR>
<B>19,14</B> Keep back Thy servant also from presumptuous sins, that they may not have dominion over me; <B>{N}</B><BR>then shall I be faultless, and I shall be clear from great transgression.<BR>
<B>19,15</B> Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee, <B>{N}</B><BR>O LORD, my Rock, and my Redeemer. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>20,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>20,2</B> The LORD answer thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high;<BR>
<B>20,3</B> Send forth thy help from the sanctuary, and support thee out of Zion;<BR>
<B>20,4</B> Receive the memorial of all thy meal-offerings, and accept the fat of thy burnt-sacrifice; Selah<BR>
<B>20,5</B> Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.<BR>
<B>20,6</B> We will shout for joy in thy victory, and in the name of our God we will set up our standards; <B>{N}</B><BR>the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.<BR>
<B>20,7</B> Now know I that the LORD saveth His anointed; <B>{N}</B><BR>He will answer him from His holy heaven with the mighty acts of His saving right hand.<BR>
<B>20,8</B> Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; <B>{N}</B><BR>but we will make mention of the name of the LORD our God.<BR>
<B>20,9</B> They are bowed down and fallen; but we are risen, and stand upright.<BR>
<B>20,10</B> Save, LORD; let the King answer us in the day that we call. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>21,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>21,2</B> O LORD, in Thy strength the king rejoiceth; and in Thy salvation how greatly doth he exult!<BR>
<B>21,3</B> Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and the request of his lips Thou hast not withholden. Selah<BR>
<B>21,4</B> For Thou meetest him with choicest blessings; Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head.<BR>
<B>21,5</B> He asked life of Thee, Thou gavest it him; even length of days for ever and ever.<BR>
<B>21,6</B> His glory is great through Thy salvation; honour and majesty dost Thou lay upon him.<BR>
<B>21,7</B> For Thou makest him most blessed for ever; Thou makest him glad with joy in Thy presence.<BR>
<B>21,8</B> For the king trusteth in the LORD, yea, in the mercy of the Most High; he shall not be moved.<BR>
<B>21,9</B> Thy hand shall be equal to all thine enemies; thy right hand shall overtake those that hate thee.<BR>
<B>21,10</B> Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger; <B>{N}</B><BR>the LORD shall swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them.<BR>
<B>21,11</B> Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.<BR>
<B>21,12</B> For they intended evil against thee, they imagined a device, wherewith they shall not prevail.<BR>
<B>21,13</B> For thou shalt make them turn their back, thou shalt make ready with thy bowstrings against the face of them.<BR>
<B>21,14</B> Be Thou exalted, O LORD, in Thy strength; so will we sing and praise Thy power. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>22,1</B> For the Leader; upon Aijeleth ha-Shahar. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>22,2</B> My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me, and art far from my help at the words of my cry?<BR>
<B>22,3</B> O my God, I call by day, but Thou answerest not; and at night, and there is no surcease for me.<BR>
<B>22,4</B> Yet Thou art holy, O Thou that art enthroned upon the praises of Israel.<BR>
<B>22,5</B> In Thee did our fathers trust; they trusted, and Thou didst deliver them.<BR>
<B>22,6</B> Unto Thee they cried, and escaped; in Thee did they trust, and were not ashamed.<BR>
<B>22,7</B> But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.<BR>
<B>22,8</B> All they that see me laugh me to scorn; they shoot out the lip, they shake the head:<BR>
<B>22,9</B> 'Let him commit himself unto the LORD! let Him rescue him; let Him deliver him, seeing He delighteth in him.'<BR>
<B>22,10</B> For Thou art He that took me out of the womb; Thou madest me trust when I was upon my mother's breasts.<BR>
<B>22,11</B> Upon Thee I have been cast from my birth; Thou art my God from my mother's womb.<BR>
<B>22,12</B> Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.<BR>
<B>22,13</B> Many bulls have encompassed me; strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.<BR>
<B>22,14</B> They open wide their mouth against me, as a ravening and a roaring lion.<BR>
<B>22,15</B> I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; <B>{N}</B><BR>my heart is become like wax; it is melted in mine inmost parts.<BR>
<B>22,16</B> My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my throat; and Thou layest me in the dust of death.<BR>
<B>22,17</B> For dogs have encompassed me; a company of evil-doers have inclosed me; like a lion, they are at my hands and my feet.<BR>
<B>22,18</B> I may count all my bones; they look and gloat over me.<BR>
<B>22,19</B> They part my garments among them, and for my vesture do they cast lots.<BR>
<B>22,20</B> But Thou, O LORD, be not far off; O Thou my strength, hasten to help me.<BR>
<B>22,21</B> Deliver my soul from the sword; mine only one from the power of the dog.<BR>
<B>22,22</B> Save me from the lion's mouth; yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen do Thou answer me.<BR>
<B>22,23</B> I will declare Thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I praise Thee.<BR>
<B>22,24</B> 'Ye that fear the LORD, praise Him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify Him; <B>{N}</B><BR>and stand in awe of Him, all ye the seed of Israel.<BR>
<B>22,25</B> For He hath not despised nor abhorred the lowliness of the poor; neither hath He hid His face from him; <B>{N}</B><BR>but when he cried unto Him, He heard.'<BR>
<B>22,26</B> From Thee cometh my praise in the great congregation; I will pay my vows before them that fear Him.<BR>
<B>22,27</B> Let the humble eat and be satisfied; let them praise the LORD that seek after Him; <B>{N}</B><BR>may your heart be quickened for ever!<BR>
<B>22,28</B> All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the LORD; <B>{N}</B><BR>and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Thee.<BR>
<B>22,29</B> For the kingdom is the LORD'S; and He is the ruler over the nations.<BR>
<B>22,30</B> All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship; all they that go down to the dust shall kneel before Him, <B>{N}</B><BR>even he that cannot keep his soul alive.<BR>
<B>22,31</B> A seed shall serve him; it shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation.<BR>
<B>22,32</B> They shall come and shall declare His righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that He hath done it. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>23,1</B> A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.<BR>
<B>23,2</B> He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters.<BR>
<B>23,3</B> He restoreth my soul; He guideth me in straight paths for His name's sake.<BR>
<B>23,4</B> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.<BR>
<B>23,5</B> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth over.<BR>
<B>23,6</B> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; <B>{N}</B><BR>and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>24,1</B> A Psalm of David. <B>{N}</B><BR>The earth is the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.<BR>
<B>24,2</B> For He hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.<BR>
<B>24,3</B> Who shall ascend into the mountain of the LORD? and who shall stand in His holy place?<BR>
<B>24,4</B> He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; <B>{N}</B><BR>who hath not taken My name in vain, and hath not sworn deceitfully.<BR>
<B>24,5</B> He shall receive a blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.<BR>
<B>24,6</B> Such is the generation of them that seek after Him, that seek Thy face, even Jacob. Selah<BR>
<B>24,7</B> Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; <B>{N}</B><BR>that the King of glory may come in.<BR>
<B>24,8</B> 'Who is the King of glory?' <B>{N}</B><BR>'The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.'<BR>
<B>24,9</B> Lift up your heads, O ye gates, yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors; <B>{N}</B><BR>that the King of glory may come in.<BR>
<B>24,10</B> 'Who then is the King of glory?' <B>{N}</B><BR>'The LORD of hosts; He is the King of glory.' Selah <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>25,1</B> [A Psalm] of David. Unto Thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.<BR>
<B>25,2</B> O my God, in Thee have I trusted, let me not be ashamed; let not mine enemies triumph over me.<BR>
<B>25,3</B> Yea, none that wait for Thee shall be ashamed; they shall be ashamed that deal treacherously without cause.<BR>
<B>25,4</B> Show me Thy ways, O LORD; teach me Thy paths.<BR>
<B>25,5</B> Guide me in Thy truth, and teach me; for Thou art the God of my salvation; <B>{N}</B><BR>for Thee do I wait all the day.<BR>
<B>25,6</B> Remember, O LORD, Thy compassions and Thy mercies; for they have been from of old.<BR>
<B>25,7</B> Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions; <B>{N}</B><BR>according to Thy mercy remember Thou me, for Thy goodness' sake, O LORD.<BR>
<B>25,8</B> Good and upright is the LORD; therefore doth He instruct sinners in the way.<BR>
<B>25,9</B> He guideth the humble in justice; and He teacheth the humble His way.<BR>
<B>25,10</B> All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep His covenant and His testimonies.<BR>
<B>25,11</B> For Thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.<BR>
<B>25,12</B> What man is he that feareth the LORD? Him will He instruct in the way that he should choose.<BR>
<B>25,13</B> His soul shall abide in prosperity; and his seed shall inherit the land.<BR>
<B>25,14</B> The counsel of the LORD is with them that fear Him; and His covenant, to make them know it.<BR>
<B>25,15</B> Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for He will bring forth my feet out of the net.<BR>
<B>25,16</B> Turn Thee unto me, and be gracious unto me; for I am solitary and afflicted.<BR>
<B>25,17</B> The troubles of my heart are enlarged; O bring Thou me out of my distresses.<BR>
<B>25,18</B> See mine affliction and my travail; and forgive all my sins.<BR>
<B>25,19</B> Consider how many are mine enemies, and the cruel hatred wherewith they hate me.<BR>
<B>25,20</B> O keep my soul, and deliver me; let me not be ashamed, for I have taken refuge in Thee.<BR>
<B>25,21</B> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, because I wait for Thee.<BR>
<B>25,22</B> Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>26,1</B> [A Psalm] of David. Judge me, O LORD, for I have walked in mine integrity, <B>{N}</B><BR>and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering.<BR>
<B>26,2</B> Examine me, O LORD, and try me; test my reins and my heart.<BR>
<B>26,3</B> For Thy mercy is before mine eyes; and I have walked in Thy truth.<BR>
<B>26,4</B> I have not sat with men of falsehood; neither will I go in with dissemblers.<BR>
<B>26,5</B> I hate the gathering of evil doers, and will not sit with the wicked.<BR>
<B>26,6</B> I will wash my hands in innocency; so will I compass Thine altar, O LORD,<BR>
<B>26,7</B> That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and tell of all Thy wondrous works.<BR>
<B>26,8</B> LORD, I love the habitation of Thy house, and the place where Thy glory dwelleth.<BR>
<B>26,9</B> Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood;<BR>
<B>26,10</B> In whose hands is craftiness, and their right hand is full of bribes.<BR>
<B>26,11</B> But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity; redeem me, and be gracious unto me.<BR>
<B>26,12</B> My foot standeth in an even place; in the congregations will I bless the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>27,1</B> [A Psalm] of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? <B>{N}</B><BR>The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?<BR>
<B>27,2</B> When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, <B>{N}</B><BR>even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.<BR>
<B>27,3</B> Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; <B>{N}</B><BR>though war should rise up against me, even then will I be confident.<BR>
<B>27,4</B> One thing have I asked of the LORD, that will I seek after: <B>{N}</B><BR>that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, <B>{N}</B><BR>to behold the graciousness of the LORD, and to visit early in His temple.<BR>
<B>27,5</B> For He concealeth me in His pavilion in the day of evil; <B>{N}</B><BR>He hideth me in the covert of His tent; He lifteth me up upon a rock.<BR>
<B>27,6</B> And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; and I will offer in His tabernacle sacrifices with trumpet-sound; <B>{N}</B><BR>I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.<BR>
<B>27,7</B> Hear, O LORD, when I call with my voice, and be gracious unto me, and answer me.<BR>
<B>27,8</B> In Thy behalf my heart hath said: 'Seek ye My face'; Thy face, LORD, will I seek.<BR>
<B>27,9</B> Hide not Thy face from me; put not Thy servant away in anger; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou hast been my help; cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.<BR>
<B>27,10</B> For though my father and my mother have forsaken me, the LORD will take me up.<BR>
<B>27,11</B> Teach me Thy way, O LORD; and lead me in an even path, because of them that lie in wait for me.<BR>
<B>27,12</B> Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries; for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out violence.<BR>
<B>27,13</B> If I had not believed to look upon the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living!--<BR>
<B>27,14</B> Wait on the LORD; be strong, and let thy heart take courage; yea, wait thou for the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>28,1</B> [A Psalm] of David. Unto thee, O LORD, do I call; my Rock, be not Thou deaf unto me; <B>{N}</B><BR>lest, if Thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit.<BR>
<B>28,2</B> Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto Thee, <B>{N}</B><BR>when I lift up my hands toward Thy holy Sanctuary.<BR>
<B>28,3</B> Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity; <B>{N}</B><BR>who speak peace with their neighbours, but evil is in their hearts.<BR>
<B>28,4</B> Give them according to their deeds, and according to the evil of their endeavours; <B>{N}</B><BR>give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.<BR>
<B>28,5</B> Because they give no heed to the works of the LORD, nor to the operation of His hands; <B>{N}</B><BR>He will break them down and not build them up.<BR>
<B>28,6</B> Blessed be the LORD, because He hath heard the voice of my supplications.<BR>
<B>28,7</B> The LORD is my strength and my shield, in Him hath my heart trusted, and I am helped; <B>{N}</B><BR>therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth, and with my song will I praise Him.<BR>
<B>28,8</B> The LORD is a strength unto them; and He is a stronghold of salvation to His anointed.<BR>
<B>28,9</B> Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance; <B>{N}</B><BR>and tend them, and carry them for ever. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>29,1</B> A Psalm of David. Ascribe unto the LORD, O ye sons of might, ascribe unto the LORD glory and strength.<BR>
<B>29,2</B> Ascribe unto the LORD the glory due unto His name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.<BR>
<B>29,3</B> The voice of the LORD is upon the waters; <B>{N}</B><BR>the God of glory thundereth, even the LORD upon many waters.<BR>
<B>29,4</B> The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.<BR>
<B>29,5</B> The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.<BR>
<B>29,6</B> He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox.<BR>
<B>29,7</B> The voice of the LORD heweth out flames of fire.<BR>
<B>29,8</B> The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.<BR>
<B>29,9</B> The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and strippeth the forests bare; <B>{N}</B><BR>and in His temple all say: 'Glory.'<BR>
<B>29,10</B> The LORD sat enthroned at the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth as King for ever.<BR>
<B>29,11</B> The LORD will give strength unto His people; the LORD will bless his people with peace. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>30,1</B> A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House; of David.<BR>
<B>30,2</B> I will extol thee, O LORD, for Thou hast raised me up, and hast not suffered mine enemies to rejoice over me.<BR>
<B>30,3</B> O LORD my God, I cried unto Thee, and Thou didst heal me;<BR>
<B>30,4</B> O LORD, Thou broughtest up my soul from the nether-world; Thou didst keep me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.<BR>
<B>30,5</B> Sing praise unto the LORD, O ye His godly ones, and give thanks to His holy name.<BR>
<B>30,6</B> For His anger is but for a moment, His favour is for a life-time; <B>{N}</B><BR>weeping may tarry for the night, but joy cometh in the morning.<BR>
<B>30,7</B> Now I had said in my security: 'I shall never be moved.'<BR>
<B>30,8</B> Thou hadst established, O LORD, in Thy favour my mountain as a stronghold-- <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou didst hide Thy face; I was affrighted.<BR>
<B>30,9</B> Unto Thee, O LORD, did I call, and unto the LORD I made supplication:<BR>
<B>30,10</B> 'What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? <B>{N}</B><BR>Shall the dust praise Thee? shall it declare Thy truth?<BR>
<B>30,11</B> Hear, O LORD, and be gracious unto me; LORD, be Thou my helper.'<BR>
<B>30,12</B> Thou didst turn for me my mourning into dancing; Thou didst loose my sackcloth, and gird me with gladness;<BR>
<B>30,13</B> So that my glory may sing praise to Thee, and not be silent; <B>{N}</B><BR>O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto Thee for ever. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>31,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>31,2</B> In thee, O LORD, have I taken refuge; let me never be ashamed; deliver me in Thy righteousness.<BR>
<B>31,3</B> Incline Thine ear unto me, deliver me speedily; <B>{N}</B><BR>be Thou to me a rock of refuge, even a fortress of defence, to save me.<BR>
<B>31,4</B> For Thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for Thy name's sake lead me and guide me.<BR>
<B>31,5</B> Bring me forth out of the net that they have hidden for me; for Thou art my stronghold.<BR>
<B>31,6</B> Into Thy hand I commit my spirit; Thou hast redeemed me, O LORD, Thou God of truth.<BR>
<B>31,7</B> I hate them that regard lying vanities; but I trust in the LORD.<BR>
<B>31,8</B> I will be glad and rejoice in Thy lovingkindness; <B>{N}</B><BR>for Thou hast seen mine affliction, Thou hast taken cognizance of the troubles of my soul,<BR>
<B>31,9</B> And Thou hast not given me over into the hand of the enemy; Thou hast set my feet in a broad place.<BR>
<B>31,10</B> Be gracious unto me, O LORD, for I am in distress; <B>{N}</B><BR>mine eye wasteth away with vexation, yea, my soul and my body.<BR>
<B>31,11</B> For my life is spent in sorrow, and my years in sighing; <B>{N}</B><BR>my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are wasted away.<BR>
<B>31,12</B> Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach, yea, unto my neighbours exceedingly, and a dread to mine acquaintance; <B>{N}</B><BR>they that see me without flee from me.<BR>
<B>31,13</B> I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am like a useless vessel.<BR>
<B>31,14</B> For I have heard the whispering of many, terror on every side; <B>{N}</B><BR>while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.<BR>
<B>31,15</B> But as for me, I have trusted in Thee, O LORD; I have said: 'Thou art my God.'<BR>
<B>31,16</B> My times are in Thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.<BR>
<B>31,17</B> Make Thy face to shine upon Thy servant; save me in Thy lovingkindness.<BR>
<B>31,18</B> O LORD, let me not be ashamed, for I have called upon Thee; let the wicked be ashamed, let them be put to silence in the nether-world.<BR>
<B>31,19</B> Let the lying lips be dumb, which speak arrogantly against the righteous, with pride and contempt.<BR>
<B>31,20</B> Oh how abundant is Thy goodness, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee; <B>{N}</B><BR>which Thou hast wrought for them that take their refuge in Thee, in the sight of the sons of men!<BR>
<B>31,21</B> Thou hidest them in the covert of Thy presence from the plottings of man; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou concealest them in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.<BR>
<B>31,22</B> Blessed be the LORD; for He hath shown me His wondrous lovingkindness in an entrenched city.<BR>
<B>31,23</B> As for me, I said in my haste: 'I am cut off from before Thine eyes'; <B>{N}</B><BR>nevertheless Thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto Thee.<BR>
<B>31,24</B> O love the LORD, all ye His godly ones; <B>{N}</B><BR>the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully repayeth him that acteth haughtily.<BR>
<B>31,25</B> Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all ye that wait for the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>32,1</B> [A Psalm] of David. Maschil. Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned.<BR>
<B>32,2</B> Happy is the man unto whom the LORD counteth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.<BR>
<B>32,3</B> When I kept silence, my bones wore away through my groaning all the day long.<BR>
<B>32,4</B> For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me; <B>{N}</B><BR>my sap was turned as in the droughts of summer. Selah<BR>
<B>32,5</B> I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid; <B>{N}</B><BR>I said: 'I will make confession concerning my transgressions unto the LORD'-- <B>{N}</B><BR>and Thou, Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah<BR>
<B>32,6</B> For this let every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found; <B>{N}</B><BR>surely, when the great waters overflow, they will not reach unto him.<BR>
<B>32,7</B> Thou art my hiding-place; Thou wilt preserve me from the adversary; <B>{N}</B><BR>with songs of deliverance Thou wilt compass me about. Selah<BR>
<B>32,8</B> 'I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will give counsel, Mine eye being upon thee.'<BR>
<B>32,9</B> Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; <B>{N}</B><BR>whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, that they come not near unto thee.<BR>
<B>32,10</B> Many are the sorrows of the wicked; but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy compasseth him about.<BR>
<B>32,11</B> Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous; and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>33,1</B> Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous, praise is comely for the upright.<BR>
<B>33,2</B> Give thanks unto the LORD with harp, sing praises unto Him with the psaltery of ten strings.<BR>
<B>33,3</B> Sing unto Him a new song; play skilfully amid shouts of joy.<BR>
<B>33,4</B> For the word of the LORD is upright; and all His work is done in faithfulness.<BR>
<B>33,5</B> He loveth righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the lovingkindness of the LORD.<BR>
<B>33,6</B> By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.<BR>
<B>33,7</B> He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap; He layeth up the deeps in storehouses.<BR>
<B>33,8</B> Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.<BR>
<B>33,9</B> For He spoke, and it was; He commanded, and it stood.<BR>
<B>33,10</B> The LORD bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought; He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.<BR>
<B>33,11</B> The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations.<BR>
<B>33,12</B> Happy is the nation whose God is the LORD; the people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance.<BR>
<B>33,13</B> The LORD looketh from heaven; He beholdeth all the sons of men;<BR>
<B>33,14</B> From the place of His habitation He looketh intently upon all the inhabitants of the earth;<BR>
<B>33,15</B> He that fashioneth the hearts of them all, that considereth all their doings.<BR>
<B>33,16</B> A king is not saved by the multitude of a host; a mighty man is not delivered by great strength.<BR>
<B>33,17</B> A horse is a vain thing for safety; neither doth it afford escape by its great strength.<BR>
<B>33,18</B> Behold, the eye of the LORD is toward them that fear Him, toward them that wait for His mercy;<BR>
<B>33,19</B> To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.<BR>
<B>33,20</B> Our soul hath waited for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.<BR>
<B>33,21</B> For in Him doth our heart rejoice, because we have trusted in His holy name.<BR>
<B>33,22</B> Let Thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we have waited for Thee. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>34,1</B> [A Psalm] of David; when he changed his demeanour before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.<BR>
<B>34,2</B> I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.<BR>
<B>34,3</B> My soul shall glory in the LORD; the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.<BR>
<B>34,4</B> O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt His name together.<BR>
<B>34,5</B> I sought the LORD, and He answered me, and delivered me from all my fears.<BR>
<B>34,6</B> They looked unto Him, and were radiant; and their faces shall never be abashed.<BR>
<B>34,7</B> This poor man cried, and the LORD heard, and saved him out of all his troubles.<BR>
<B>34,8</B> The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.<BR>
<B>34,9</B> O consider and see that the LORD is good; happy is the man that taketh refuge in Him.<BR>
<B>34,10</B> O fear the LORD, ye His holy ones; for there is no want to them that fear Him.<BR>
<B>34,11</B> The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but they that seek the LORD want not any good thing.<BR>
<B>34,12</B> Come, ye children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.<BR>
<B>34,13</B> Who is the man that desireth life, and loveth days, that he may see good therein?<BR>
<B>34,14</B> Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.<BR>
<B>34,15</B> Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.<BR>
<B>34,16</B> The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous, and His ears are open unto their cry.<BR>
<B>34,17</B> The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.<BR>
<B>34,18</B> They cried, and the LORD heard, and delivered them out of all their troubles.<BR>
<B>34,19</B> The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.<BR>
<B>34,20</B> Many are the ills of the righteous, but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.<BR>
<B>34,21</B> He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is broken.<BR>
<B>34,22</B> Evil shall kill the wicked; and they that hate the righteous shall be held guilty.<BR>
<B>34,23</B> The LORD redeemeth the soul of His servants; and none of them that take refuge in Him shall be desolate. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>35,1</B> A Psalm of David. Strive, O LORD, with them that strive with me; fight against them that fight against me.<BR>
<B>35,2</B> Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise up to my help.<BR>
<B>35,3</B> Draw out also the spear, and the battle-axe, against them that pursue me; say unto my soul: 'I am thy salvation.'<BR>
<B>35,4</B> Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion that seek after my soul; let them be turned back and be abashed that devise my hurt.<BR>
<B>35,5</B> Let them be as chaff before the wind, the angel of the LORD thrusting them.<BR>
<B>35,6</B> Let their way be dark and slippery, the angel of the LORD pursuing them.<BR>
<B>35,7</B> For without cause have they hid for me the pit, even their net, without cause have they digged for my soul.<BR>
<B>35,8</B> Let destruction come upon him unawares; <B>{N}</B><BR>and let his net that he hath hid catch himself; with destruction let him fall therein.<BR>
<B>35,9</B> And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD; it shall rejoice in His salvation.<BR>
<B>35,10</B> All my bones shall say: 'LORD, who is like unto Thee, <B>{N}</B><BR>who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?'<BR>
<B>35,11</B> Unrighteous witnesses rise up; they ask me of things that I know not.<BR>
<B>35,12</B> They repay me evil for good; bereavement is come to my soul.<BR>
<B>35,13</B> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth, I afflicted my soul with fasting; <B>{N}</B><BR>and my prayer, may it return into mine own bosom.<BR>
<B>35,14</B> I went about as though it had been my friend or my brother; I bowed down mournful, as one that mourneth for his mother.<BR>
<B>35,15</B> But when I halt they rejoice, and gather themselves together; <B>{N}</B><BR>the abjects gather themselves together against me, and those whom I know not; <B>{N}</B><BR>they tear me, and cease not;<BR>
<B>35,16</B> With the profanest mockeries of backbiting they gnash at me with their teeth.<BR>
<B>35,17</B> Lord, how long wilt Thou look on? <B>{N}</B><BR>Rescue my soul from their destructions, mine only one from the lions.<BR>
<B>35,18</B> I will give Thee thanks in the great congregation; I will praise Thee among a numerous people.<BR>
<B>35,19</B> Let not them that are wrongfully mine enemies rejoice over me; neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.<BR>
<B>35,20</B> For they speak not peace; but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.<BR>
<B>35,21</B> Yea, they open their mouth wide against me; they say: 'Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.'<BR>
<B>35,22</B> Thou hast seen, O LORD; keep not silence; O Lord, be not far from me.<BR>
<B>35,23</B> Rouse Thee, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.<BR>
<B>35,24</B> Judge me, O LORD my God, according to Thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.<BR>
<B>35,25</B> Let them not say in their heart: 'Aha, we have our desire'; let them not say: 'We have swallowed him up.'<BR>
<B>35,26</B> Let them be ashamed and abashed together that rejoice at my hurt; <B>{N}</B><BR>let them be clothed with shame and confusion that magnify themselves against me.<BR>
<B>35,27</B> Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that delight in my righteousness; <B>{N}</B><BR>yea, let them say continually: 'Magnified be the LORD, who delighteth in the peace of His servant.'<BR>
<B>35,28</B> And my tongue shall speak of Thy righteousness, and of Thy praise all the day. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>36,1</B> For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David the servant of the LORD.<BR>
<B>36,2</B> Transgression speaketh to the wicked, methinks--there is no fear of God before his eyes.<BR>
<B>36,3</B> For it flattereth him in his eyes, until his iniquity be found, and he be hated.<BR>
<B>36,4</B> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit; he hath left off to be wise, to do good.<BR>
<B>36,5</B> He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.<BR>
<B>36,6</B> Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, is in the heavens; Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies.<BR>
<B>36,7</B> Thy righteousness is like the mighty mountains; Thy judgments are like the great deep; man and beast Thou preservest, O LORD.<BR>
<B>36,8</B> How precious is Thy lovingkindness, O God! and the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Thy wings.<BR>
<B>36,9</B> They are abundantly satisfied with the fatness of Thy house; and Thou makest them drink of the river of Thy pleasures.<BR>
<B>36,10</B> For with Thee is the fountain of life; in Thy light do we see light.<BR>
<B>36,11</B> O continue Thy lovingkindness unto them that know Thee; and Thy righteousness to the upright in heart.<BR>
<B>36,12</B> Let not the foot of pride overtake me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.<BR>
<B>36,13</B> There are the workers of iniquity fallen; they are thrust down, and are not able to rise. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>37,1</B> [A Psalm] of David. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness.<BR>
<B>37,2</B> For they shall soon wither like the grass, and fade as the green herb.<BR>
<B>37,3</B> Trust in the LORD, and do good; dwell in the land, and cherish faithfulness.<BR>
<B>37,4</B> So shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and He shall give thee the petitions of thy heart.<BR>
<B>37,5</B> Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in Him, and He will bring it to pass.<BR>
<B>37,6</B> And He will make thy righteousness to go forth as the light, and thy right as the noonday.<BR>
<B>37,7</B> Resign thyself unto the LORD, and wait patiently for Him; <B>{N}</B><BR>fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.<BR>
<B>37,8</B> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing.<BR>
<B>37,9</B> For evil-doers shall be cut off; but those that wait for the LORD, they shall inherit the land.<BR>
<B>37,10</B> And yet a little while, and the wicked is no more; yea, thou shalt look well at his place, and he is not.<BR>
<B>37,11</B> But the humble shall inherit the land, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace.<BR>
<B>37,12</B> The wicked plotteth against the righteous, and gnasheth at him with his teeth.<BR>
<B>37,13</B> The Lord doth laugh at him; for He seeth that his day is coming.<BR>
<B>37,14</B> The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow; <B>{N}</B><BR>to cast down the poor and needy, to slay such as are upright in the way;<BR>
<B>37,15</B> Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.<BR>
<B>37,16</B> Better is a little that the righteous hath than the abundance of many wicked.<BR>
<B>37,17</B> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.<BR>
<B>37,18</B> The LORD knoweth the days of them that are wholehearted; and their inheritance shall be for ever.<BR>
<B>37,19</B> They shall not be ashamed in the time of evil; and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.<BR>
<B>37,20</B> For the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs--they shall pass away in smoke, they shall pass away.<BR>
<B>37,21</B> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not; but the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth.<BR>
<B>37,22</B> For such as are blessed of Him shall inherit the land; and they that are cursed of Him shall be cut off.<BR>
<B>37,23</B> It is of the LORD that a man's goings are established; and He delighted in his way.<BR>
<B>37,24</B> Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for the LORD upholdeth his hand.<BR>
<B>37,25</B> I have been young, and now am old; <B>{N}</B><BR>yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.<BR>
<B>37,26</B> All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.<BR>
<B>37,27</B> Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.<BR>
<B>37,28</B> For the LORD loveth justice, and forsaketh not His saints; they are preserved for ever; <B>{N}</B><BR>but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.<BR>
<B>37,29</B> The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.<BR>
<B>37,30</B> The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, and his tongue speaketh justice.<BR>
<B>37,31</B> The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps slide.<BR>
<B>37,32</B> The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.<BR>
<B>37,33</B> The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor suffer him to be condemned when he is judged.<BR>
<B>37,34</B> Wait for the LORD, and keep His way, and He will exalt thee to inherit the land; <B>{N}</B><BR>when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.<BR>
<B>37,35</B> I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a leafy tree in its native soil.<BR>
<B>37,36</B> But one passed by, and, lo, he was not; yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.<BR>
<B>37,37</B> Mark the man of integrity, and behold the upright; for there is a future for the man of peace.<BR>
<B>37,38</B> But transgressors shall be destroyed together; the future of the wicked shall be cut off.<BR>
<B>37,39</B> But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD; He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.<BR>
<B>37,40</B> And the LORD helpeth them, and delivereth them; He delivereth them from the wicked, and saveth them, because they have taken refuge in Him. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>38,1</B> A Psalm of David, to make memorial.<BR>
<B>38,2</B> O LORD, rebuke me not in Thine anger; neither chasten me in Thy wrath.<BR>
<B>38,3</B> For Thine arrows are gone deep into me, and Thy hand is come down upon me.<BR>
<B>38,4</B> There is no soundness in my flesh because of Thine indignation; neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.<BR>
<B>38,5</B> For mine iniquities are gone over my head; as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.<BR>
<B>38,6</B> My wounds are noisome, they fester, because of my foolishness.<BR>
<B>38,7</B> I am bent and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day.<BR>
<B>38,8</B> For my loins are filled with burning; and there is no soundness in my flesh.<BR>
<B>38,9</B> I am benumbed and sore crushed; I groan by reason of the moaning of my heart.<BR>
<B>38,10</B> Lord, all my desire is before Thee; and my sighing is not hid from Thee.<BR>
<B>38,11</B> My heart fluttereth, my strength faileth me; as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.<BR>
<B>38,12</B> My friends and my companions stand aloof from my plague; and my kinsmen stand afar off.<BR>
<B>38,13</B> They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; and they that seek my hurt speak crafty devices, and utter deceits all the day.<BR>
<B>38,14</B> But I am as a deaf man, I hear not; and I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.<BR>
<B>38,15</B> Yea, I am become as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no arguments.<BR>
<B>38,16</B> For in Thee, O LORD, do I hope; Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God.<BR>
<B>38,17</B> For I said: 'Lest they rejoice over me; when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.'<BR>
<B>38,18</B> For I am ready to halt, and my pain is continually before me.<BR>
<B>38,19</B> For I do declare mine iniquity; I am full of care because of my sin.<BR>
<B>38,20</B> But mine enemies are strong in health; and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.<BR>
<B>38,21</B> They also that repay evil for good are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good.<BR>
<B>38,22</B> Forsake me not, O LORD; O my God, be not far from me.<BR>
<B>38,23</B> Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>39,1</B> For the Leader, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>39,2</B> I said: 'I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue; <B>{N}</B><BR>I will keep a curb upon my mouth, while the wicked is before me.'<BR>
<B>39,3</B> I was dumb with silence; I held my peace, had no comfort; and my pain was held in check.<BR>
<B>39,4</B> My heart waxed hot within me; while I was musing, the fire kindled; then spoke I with my tongue:<BR>
<B>39,5</B> 'LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; let me know how short-lived I am.<BR>
<B>39,6</B> Behold, Thou hast made my days as hand-breadths; and mine age is as nothing before Thee; <B>{N}</B><BR>surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah<BR>
<B>39,7</B> Surely man walketh as a mere semblance; surely for vanity they are in turmoil; <B>{N}</B><BR>he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.<BR>
<B>39,8</B> And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope, it is in Thee.<BR>
<B>39,9</B> Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the base.<BR>
<B>39,10</B> I am dumb, I open not my mouth; because Thou hast done it.<BR>
<B>39,11</B> Remove Thy stroke from off me; I am consumed by the blow of Thy hand.<BR>
<B>39,12</B> With rebukes dost Thou chasten man for iniquity, and like a moth Thou makest his beauty to consume away; <B>{N}</B><BR>surely every man is vanity. Selah<BR>
<B>39,13</B> Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; <B>{N}</B><BR>keep not silence at my tears; <B>{N}</B><BR>for I am a stranger with Thee, a sojourner, as all my fathers were.<BR>
<B>39,14</B> Look away from me, that I may take comfort, before I go hence, and be no more.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>40,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>40,2</B> I waited patiently for the LORD; and He inclined unto me, and heard my cry.<BR>
<B>40,3</B> He brought me up also out of the tumultuous pit, out of the miry clay; <B>{N}</B><BR>and He set my feet upon a rock, He established my goings.<BR>
<B>40,4</B> And He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God; <B>{N}</B><BR>many shall see, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.<BR>
<B>40,5</B> Happy is the man that hath made the LORD his trust, <B>{N}</B><BR>and hath not turned unto the arrogant, nor unto such as fall away treacherously.<BR>
<B>40,6</B> Many things hast Thou done, O LORD my God, <B>{N}</B><BR>even Thy wonderful works, and Thy thoughts toward us; <B>{N}</B><BR>there is none to be compared unto Thee! If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be told.<BR>
<B>40,7</B> Sacrifice and meal-offering Thou hast no delight in; mine ears hast Thou opened; <B>{N}</B><BR>burnt-offering and sin-offering hast Thou not required.<BR>
<B>40,8</B> Then said I: 'Lo, I am come with the roll of a book which is prescribed for me;<BR>
<B>40,9</B> I delight to do Thy will, O my God; yea, Thy law is in my inmost parts.'<BR>
<B>40,10</B> I have preached righteousness in the great congregation, lo, I did not refrain my lips; <B>{N}</B><BR>O LORD, Thou knowest.<BR>
<B>40,11</B> I have not hid Thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation; <B>{N}</B><BR>I have not concealed Thy mercy and Thy truth from the great congregation.<BR>
<B>40,12</B> Thou, O LORD, wilt not withhold Thy compassions from me; <B>{N}</B><BR>let Thy mercy and Thy truth continually preserve me.<BR>
<B>40,13</B> For innumerable evils have compassed me about, <B>{N}</B><BR>mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; <B>{N}</B><BR>they are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.<BR>
<B>40,14</B> Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; O LORD, make haste to help me.<BR>
<B>40,15</B> Let them be ashamed and abashed together that seek after my soul to sweep it away; <B>{N}</B><BR>let them be turned backward and brought to confusion that delight in my hurt.<BR>
<B>40,16</B> Let them be appalled by reason of their shame that say unto me: 'Aha, aha.'<BR>
<B>40,17</B> Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; <B>{N}</B><BR>let such as love Thy salvation say continually: 'The LORD be magnified.'<BR>
<B>40,18</B> But, as for me, that am poor and needy, the Lord will account it unto me; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou art my help and my deliverer; O my God, tarry not. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>41,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>41,2</B> Happy is he that considereth the poor; the LORD will deliver him in the day of evil.<BR>
<B>41,3</B> The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, let him be called happy in the land; and deliver not Thou him unto the greed of his enemies.<BR>
<B>41,4</B> The LORD support him upon the bed of illness; mayest Thou turn all his lying down in his sickness.<BR>
<B>41,5</B> As for me, I said: 'O LORD, be gracious unto me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee.'<BR>
<B>41,6</B> Mine enemies speak evil of me: 'When shall he die, and his name perish?'<BR>
<B>41,7</B> And if one come to see me, he speaketh falsehood; his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he speaketh of it.<BR>
<B>41,8</B> All that hate me whisper together against me, against me do they devise my hurt:<BR>
<B>41,9</B> 'An evil thing cleaveth fast unto him; and now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.'<BR>
<B>41,10</B> Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who did eat of my bread, <B>{N}</B><BR>hath lifted up his heel against me.<BR>
<B>41,11</B> But Thou, O LORD, be gracious unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.<BR>
<B>41,12</B> By this I know that Thou delightest in me, that mine enemy doth not triumph over me.<BR>
<B>41,13</B> And as for me, Thou upholdest me because of mine integrity, and settest me before Thy face for ever.<BR>
<B>41,14</B> Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>42,1</B> For the Leader; Maschil of the sons of Korah.<BR>
<B>42,2</B> As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.<BR>
<B>42,3</B> My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: <B>{N}</B><BR>'When shall I come and appear before God?'<BR>
<B>42,4</B> My tears have been my food day and night, <B>{N}</B><BR>while they say unto me all the day: 'Where is thy God?'<BR>
<B>42,5</B> These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, <B>{N}</B><BR>how I passed on with the throng, and led them to the house of God, <B>{N}</B><BR>with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday.<BR>
<B>42,6</B> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why moanest thou within me? <B>{N}</B><BR>Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him for the salvation of His countenance.<BR>
<B>42,7</B> O my God, my soul is cast down within me; <B>{N}</B><BR>therefore do I remember Thee from the land of Jordan, and the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.<BR>
<B>42,8</B> Deep calleth unto deep at the voice of Thy cataracts; <B>{N}</B><BR>all Thy waves and Thy billows are gone over me.<BR>
<B>42,9</B> By day the LORD will command His lovingkindness, and in the night His song shall be with me, <B>{N}</B><BR>even a prayer unto the God of my life.<BR>
<B>42,10</B> I will say unto God my Rock: 'Why hast Thou forgotten me? <B>{N}</B><BR>Why go I mourning under the oppression of the enemy?'<BR>
<B>42,11</B> As with a crushing in my bones, mine adversaries taunt me; <B>{N}</B><BR>while they say unto me all the day: 'Where is thy God?'<BR>
<B>42,12</B> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why moanest thou within me? <B>{N}</B><BR>Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>43,1</B> Be Thou my judge, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; <B>{N}</B><BR>O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.<BR>
<B>43,2</B> For Thou art the God of my strength; why hast Thou cast me off? <B>{N}</B><BR>Why go I mourning under the oppression of the enemy?<BR>
<B>43,3</B> O send out Thy light and Thy truth; let them lead me; <B>{N}</B><BR>let them bring me unto Thy holy mountain, and to Thy dwelling-places.<BR>
<B>43,4</B> Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God, my exceeding joy; <B>{N}</B><BR>and praise Thee upon the harp, O God, my God.<BR>
<B>43,5</B> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why moanest thou within me? <B>{N}</B><BR>Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>44,1</B> For the Leader; [a Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil.<BR>
<B>44,2</B> O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us; <B>{N}</B><BR>a work Thou didst in their days, in the days of old.<BR>
<B>44,3</B> Thou with Thy hand didst drive out the nations, and didst plant them in; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou didst break the peoples, and didst spread them abroad.<BR>
<B>44,4</B> For not by their own sword did they get the land in possession, neither did their own arm save them; <B>{N}</B><BR>but Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance, because Thou wast favourable unto them.<BR>
<B>44,5</B> Thou art my King, O God; command the salvation of Jacob.<BR>
<B>44,6</B> Through Thee do we push down our adversaries; through Thy name do we tread them under that rise up against us.<BR>
<B>44,7</B> For I trust not in my bow, neither can my sword save me.<BR>
<B>44,8</B> But Thou hast saved us from our adversaries, and hast put them to shame that hate us.<BR>
<B>44,9</B> In God have we gloried all the day, and we will give thanks unto Thy name for ever. Selah<BR>
<B>44,10</B> Yet Thou hast cast off, and brought us to confusion; and goest not forth with our hosts.<BR>
<B>44,11</B> Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary; and they that hate us spoil at their will.<BR>
<B>44,12</B> Thou hast given us like sheep to be eaten; and hast scattered us among the nations.<BR>
<B>44,13</B> Thou sellest Thy people for small gain, and hast not set their prices high.<BR>
<B>44,14</B> Thou makest us a taunt to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.<BR>
<B>44,15</B> Thou makest us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.<BR>
<B>44,16</B> All the day is my confusion before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,<BR>
<B>44,17</B> For the voice of him that taunteth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and the revengeful.<BR>
<B>44,18</B> All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten Thee, neither have we been false to Thy covenant.<BR>
<B>44,19</B> Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from Thy path;<BR>
<B>44,20</B> Though Thou hast crushed us into a place of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death.<BR>
<B>44,21</B> If we had forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange god;<BR>
<B>44,22</B> Would not God search this out? For He knoweth the secrets of the heart.<BR>
<B>44,23</B> Nay, but for Thy sake are we killed all the day; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.<BR>
<B>44,24</B> Awake, why sleepest Thou, O Lord? Arouse Thyself, cast not off for ever.<BR>
<B>44,25</B> Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?<BR>
<B>44,26</B> For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly cleaveth unto the earth.<BR>
<B>44,27</B> Arise for our help, and redeem us for Thy mercy's sake. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>45,1</B> For the Leader; upon Shoshannim; [a Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of loves.<BR>
<B>45,2</B> My heart overfloweth with a goodly matter; I say: 'My work is concerning a king'; <B>{N}</B><BR>my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.<BR>
<B>45,3</B> Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured upon thy lips; <B>{N}</B><BR>therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.<BR>
<B>45,4</B> Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one, thy glory and thy majesty.<BR>
<B>45,5</B> And in thy majesty prosper, ride on, in behalf of truth and meekness and righteousness; <B>{N}</B><BR>and let thy right hand teach thee tremendous things.<BR>
<B>45,6</B> Thine arrows are sharp--the peoples fall under thee--[they sink] into the heart of the king's enemies.<BR>
<B>45,7</B> Thy throne given of God is for ever and ever; a sceptre of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.<BR>
<B>45,8</B> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; <B>{N}</B><BR>therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.<BR>
<B>45,9</B> Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia are all thy garments; out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.<BR>
<B>45,10</B> Kings' daughters are among thy favourites; at thy right hand doth stand the queen in gold of Ophir.<BR>
<B>45,11</B> 'Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;<BR>
<B>45,12</B> So shall the king desire thy beauty; for he is thy lord; and do homage unto him.<BR>
<B>45,13</B> And, O daughter of Tyre, the richest of the people shall entreat thy favour with a gift.'<BR>
<B>45,14</B> All glorious is the king's daughter within the palace; her raiment is of chequer work inwrought with gold.<BR>
<B>45,15</B> She shall be led unto the king on richly woven stuff; the virgins her companions in her train being brought unto thee.<BR>
<B>45,16</B> They shall be led with gladness and rejoicing; they shall enter into the king's palace.<BR>
<B>45,17</B> Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons, whom thou shalt make princes in all the land.<BR>
<B>45,18</B> I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations; therefore shall the peoples praise thee for ever and ever. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>46,1</B> For the Leader; [a Psalm] of the sons of Korah; upon Alamoth. A Song.<BR>
<B>46,2</B> God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.<BR>
<B>46,3</B> Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change, and though the mountains be moved into the heart of the seas;<BR>
<B>46,4</B> Though the waters thereof roar and foam, though the mountains shake at the swelling thereof. Selah<BR>
<B>46,5</B> There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, the holiest dwelling-place of the Most High.<BR>
<B>46,6</B> God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; God shall help her, at the approach of morning.<BR>
<B>46,7</B> Nations were in tumult, kingdoms were moved; He uttered His voice, the earth melted.<BR>
<B>46,8</B> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high tower. Selah<BR>
<B>46,9</B> Come, behold the works of the LORD, who hath made desolations in the earth.<BR>
<B>46,10</B> He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; <B>{N}</B><BR>He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; He burneth the chariots in the fire.<BR>
<B>46,11</B> 'Let be, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.'<BR>
<B>46,12</B> The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high tower. Selah <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>47,1</B> For the Leader; a Psalm for the sons of Korah.<BR>
<B>47,2</B> O clap your hands, all ye peoples; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.<BR>
<B>47,3</B> For the LORD is most high, awful; a great King over all the earth.<BR>
<B>47,4</B> He subdueth peoples under us, and nations under our feet.<BR>
<B>47,5</B> He chooseth our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob whom He loveth. Selah<BR>
<B>47,6</B> God is gone up amidst shouting, the LORD amidst the sound of the horn.<BR>
<B>47,7</B> Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises.<BR>
<B>47,8</B> For God is the King of all the earth; sing ye praises in a skilful song.<BR>
<B>47,9</B> God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon His holy throne.<BR>
<B>47,10</B> The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham; <B>{N}</B><BR>for unto God belong the shields of the earth; He is greatly exalted. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>48,1</B> A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.<BR>
<B>48,2</B> Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised, in the city of our God, His holy mountain,<BR>
<B>48,3</B> Fair in situation, the joy of the whole earth; <B>{N}</B><BR>even mount Zion, the uttermost parts of the north, the city of the great King.<BR>
<B>48,4</B> God in her palaces hath made Himself known for a stronghold.<BR>
<B>48,5</B> For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, they came onward together.<BR>
<B>48,6</B> They saw, straightway they were amazed; they were affrighted, they hasted away.<BR>
<B>48,7</B> Trembling took hold of them there, pangs, as of a woman in travail.<BR>
<B>48,8</B> With the east wind Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish.<BR>
<B>48,9</B> As we have heard, so have we seen <B>{N}</B><BR>in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God-- <B>{N}</B><BR>God establish it for ever. Selah<BR>
<B>48,10</B> We have thought on Thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of Thy temple.<BR>
<B>48,11</B> As is Thy name, O God, so is Thy praise unto the ends of the earth; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thy right hand is full of righteousness.<BR>
<B>48,12</B> Let mount Zion be glad, let the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of Thy judgments.<BR>
<B>48,13</B> Walk about Zion, and go round about her; count the towers thereof.<BR>
<B>48,14</B> Mark ye well her ramparts, traverse her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.<BR>
<B>48,15</B> For such is God, our God, for ever and ever; He will guide us eternally. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>49,1</B> For the Leader; a Psalm of the sons of Korah.<BR>
<B>49,2</B> Hear this, all ye peoples; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,<BR>
<B>49,3</B> Both low and high, rich and poor together.<BR>
<B>49,4</B> My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.<BR>
<B>49,5</B> I will incline mine ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying upon the harp.<BR>
<B>49,6</B> Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my supplanters compasseth me about,<BR>
<B>49,7</B> Of them that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches?<BR>
<B>49,8</B> No man can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him--<BR>
<B>49,9</B> For too costly is the redemption of their soul, and must be let alone for ever--<BR>
<B>49,10</B> That he should still live alway, that he should not see the pit.<BR>
<B>49,11</B> For he seeth that wise men die, the fool and the brutish together perish, <B>{N}</B><BR>and leave their wealth to others.<BR>
<B>49,12</B> Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling-places to all generations; <B>{N}</B><BR>they call their lands after their own names.<BR>
<B>49,13</B> But man abideth not in honour; he is like the beasts that perish.<BR>
<B>49,14</B> This is the way of them that are foolish, and of those who after them approve their sayings. Selah<BR>
<B>49,15</B> Like sheep they are appointed for the nether-world; death shall be their shepherd; <B>{N}</B><BR>and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their form shall be for the nether-world to wear away, that there be no habitation for it.<BR>
<B>49,16</B> But God will redeem my soul from the power of the nether-world; for He shall receive me. Selah<BR>
<B>49,17</B> Be not thou afraid when one waxeth rich, when the wealth of his house is increased;<BR>
<B>49,18</B> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; his wealth shall not descend after him.<BR>
<B>49,19</B> Though while he lived he blessed his soul: 'Men will praise thee, when thou shalt do well to thyself';<BR>
<B>49,20</B> It shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see the light.<BR>
<B>49,21</B> Man that is in honour understandeth not; he is like the beasts that perish. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>50,1</B> A Psalm of Asaph. <B>{N}</B><BR>God, God, the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth <B>{N}</B><BR>from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.<BR>
<B>50,2</B> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth.<BR>
<B>50,3</B> Our God cometh, and doth not keep silence; <B>{N}</B><BR>a fire devoureth before Him, and round about Him it stormeth mightily.<BR>
<B>50,4</B> He calleth to the heavens above, and to the earth, that He may judge His people:<BR>
<B>50,5</B> 'Gather My saints together unto Me; those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.'<BR>
<B>50,6</B> And the heavens declare His righteousness; for God, He is judge. Selah<BR>
<B>50,7</B> 'Hear, O My people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: <B>{N}</B><BR>God, thy God, am I.<BR>
<B>50,8</B> I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; and thy burnt-offerings are continually before Me.<BR>
<B>50,9</B> I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goats out of thy folds.<BR>
<B>50,10</B> For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.<BR>
<B>50,11</B> I know all the fowls of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the field are Mine.<BR>
<B>50,12</B> If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world is Mine, and the fulness thereof.<BR>
<B>50,13</B> Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?<BR>
<B>50,14</B> Offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the Most High;<BR>
<B>50,15</B> And call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt honour Me.'<BR>
<B>50,16</B> But unto the wicked God saith: 'What hast thou to do to declare My statutes, and that thou hast taken My covenant in thy mouth?<BR>
<B>50,17</B> Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest My words behind thee.<BR>
<B>50,18</B> When thou sawest a thief, thou hadst company with him, and with adulterers was thy portion.<BR>
<B>50,19</B> Thou hast let loose thy mouth for evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.<BR>
<B>50,20</B> Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.<BR>
<B>50,21</B> These things hast thou done, and should I have kept silence? Thou hadst thought that I was altogether such a one as thyself; <B>{N}</B><BR>but I will reprove thee, and set the cause before thine eyes.<BR>
<B>50,22</B> Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear in pieces, and there be none to deliver.<BR>
<B>50,23</B> Whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving honoureth Me; and to him that ordereth his way aright will I show the salvation of God.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>51,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of David;<BR>
<B>51,2</B> When Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba.<BR>
<B>51,3</B> Be gracious unto me, O God, according to Thy mercy; according to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my transgressions.<BR>
<B>51,4</B> Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.<BR>
<B>51,5</B> For I know my transgressions; and my sin is ever before me.<BR>
<B>51,6</B> Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, and done that which is evil in Thy sight; <B>{N}</B><BR>that Thou mayest be justified when Thou speakest, and be in the right when Thou judgest.<BR>
<B>51,7</B> Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.<BR>
<B>51,8</B> Behold, Thou desirest truth in the inward parts; make me, therefore, to know wisdom in mine inmost heart.<BR>
<B>51,9</B> Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<BR>
<B>51,10</B> Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which Thou hast crushed may rejoice.<BR>
<B>51,11</B> Hide Thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.<BR>
<B>51,12</B> Create me a clean heart, O God; and renew a stedfast spirit within me.<BR>
<B>51,13</B> Cast me not away from Thy presence; and take not Thy holy spirit from me.<BR>
<B>51,14</B> Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation; and let a willing spirit uphold me.<BR>
<B>51,15</B> Then will I teach transgressors Thy ways; and sinners shall return unto Thee.<BR>
<B>51,16</B> Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; <B>{N}</B><BR>so shall my tongue sing aloud of Thy righteousness.<BR>
<B>51,17</B> O Lord, open Thou my lips; and my mouth shall declare Thy praise.<BR>
<B>51,18</B> For Thou delightest not in sacrifice, else would I give it; Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering.<BR>
<B>51,19</B> The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; <B>{N}</B><BR>a broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.<BR>
<B>51,20</B> Do good in Thy favour unto Zion; build Thou the walls of Jerusalem.<BR>
<B>51,21</B> Then wilt Thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt-offering and whole offering; <B>{N}</B><BR>then will they offer bullocks upon Thine altar. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>52,1</B> For the Leader. Maschil of David;<BR>
<B>52,2</B> when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, <B>{N}</B><BR>and said unto him: 'David is come to the house of Ahimelech.'<BR>
<B>52,3</B> Why boastest thou thyself of evil, O mighty man? The mercy of God endureth continually.<BR>
<B>52,4</B> Thy tongue deviseth destruction; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.<BR>
<B>52,5</B> Thou lovest evil more than good; falsehood rather than speaking righteousness. Selah<BR>
<B>52,6</B> Thou lovest all devouring words, the deceitful tongue.<BR>
<B>52,7</B> God will likewise break thee for ever, <B>{N}</B><BR>He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah<BR>
<B>52,8</B> The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:<BR>
<B>52,9</B> 'Lo, this is the man that made not God his stronghold; <B>{N}</B><BR>but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.'<BR>
<B>52,10</B> But as for me, I am like a leafy olive-tree in the house of God; <B>{N}</B><BR>I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.<BR>
<B>52,11</B> I will give Thee thanks for ever, because Thou hast done it; and I will wait for Thy name, for it is good, in the presence of Thy saints. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>53,1</B> For the Leader; upon Mahalath. Maschil of David.<BR>
<B>53,2</B> The fool hath said in his heart: 'There is no God'; <B>{N}</B><BR>they have dealt corruptly, and have done abominable iniquity; there is none that doeth good.<BR>
<B>53,3</B> God looked forth from heaven upon the children of men, <B>{N}</B><BR>to see if there were any man of understanding, that did seek after God.<BR>
<B>53,4</B> Every one of them is unclean, they are together become impure; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<BR>
<B>53,5</B> 'Shall not the workers of iniquity know it, who eat up My people as they eat bread, and call not upon God?'<BR>
<B>53,6</B> There are they in great fear, where no fear was; <B>{N}</B><BR>for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee; Thou hast put them to shame, because God hath rejected them.<BR>
<B>53,7</B> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! <B>{N}</B><BR>When God turneth the captivity of His people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>54,1</B> For the Leader; with string-music. Maschil of David:<BR>
<B>54,2</B> when the Ziphites came and said to Saul: 'Doth not David hide himself with us?'<BR>
<B>54,3</B> O God, save me by Thy name, and right me by Thy might.<BR>
<B>54,4</B> O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.<BR>
<B>54,5</B> For strangers are risen up against me, and violent men have sought after my soul; <B>{N}</B><BR>they have not set God before them. Selah<BR>
<B>54,6</B> Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is for me as the upholder of my soul.<BR>
<B>54,7</B> He will requite the evil unto them that lie in wait for me; destroy Thou them in Thy truth.<BR>
<B>54,8</B> With a freewill-offering will I sacrifice unto Thee; I will give thanks unto Thy name, O LORD, for it is good.<BR>
<B>54,9</B> For He hath delivered me out of all trouble; and mine eye hath gazed upon mine enemies. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>55,1</B> For the Leader; with string-music. Maschil of David.<BR>
<B>55,2</B> Give ear, O God, to my prayer; and hide not Thyself from my supplication.<BR>
<B>55,3</B> Attend unto me, and hear me; I am distraught in my complaint, and will moan;<BR>
<B>55,4</B> Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked; for they cast mischief upon me, and in anger they persecute me.<BR>
<B>55,5</B> My heart doth writhe within me; and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.<BR>
<B>55,6</B> Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.<BR>
<B>55,7</B> And I said: 'Oh that I had wings like a dove! then would I fly away, and be at rest.<BR>
<B>55,8</B> Lo, then would I wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah<BR>
<B>55,9</B> I would haste me to a shelter from the stormy wind and tempest.'<BR>
<B>55,10</B> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongue; for I have seen violence and strife in the city.<BR>
<B>55,11</B> Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof; iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.<BR>
<B>55,12</B> Wickedness is in the midst thereof; oppression and guile depart not from her broad place.<BR>
<B>55,13</B> For it was not an enemy that taunted me, then I could have borne it; <B>{N}</B><BR>neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me, then I would have hid myself from him.<BR>
<B>55,14</B> But it was thou, a man mine equal, my companion, and my familiar friend;<BR>
<B>55,15</B> We took sweet counsel together, in the house of God we walked with the throng.<BR>
<B>55,16</B> May He incite death against them, let them go down alive into the nether-world; for evil is in their dwelling, and within them.<BR>
<B>55,17</B> As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.<BR>
<B>55,18</B> Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I complain, and moan; and He hath heard my voice.<BR>
<B>55,19</B> He hath redeemed my soul in peace so that none came nigh me; for they were many that strove with me.<BR>
<B>55,20</B> God shall hear, and humble them, even He that is enthroned of old, Selah <B>{N}</B><BR>such as have no changes, and fear not God.<BR>
<B>55,21</B> He hath put forth his hands against them that were at peace with him; he hath profaned his covenant.<BR>
<B>55,22</B> Smoother than cream were the speeches of his mouth, but his heart was war; <B>{N}</B><BR>his words were softer than oil, yet were they keen-edged swords.<BR>
<B>55,23</B> Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and He will sustain thee; <B>{N}</B><BR>He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.<BR>
<B>55,24</B> But Thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the nethermost pit; <B>{N}</B><BR>men of blood and deceit shall not live out half their days; <B>{N}</B><BR>but as for me, I will trust in Thee. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>56,1</B> For the Leader; upon Jonath-elem-rehokim. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam; <B>{N}</B><BR>when the Philistines took him in Gath.<BR>
<B>56,2</B> Be gracious unto me, O God, for man would swallow me up; all the day he fighting oppresseth me.<BR>
<B>56,3</B> They that lie in wait for me would swallow me up all the day; for they are many that fight against me, O Most High,<BR>
<B>56,4</B> In the day that I am afraid, I will put my trust in Thee.<BR>
<B>56,5</B> In God--I will praise His word-- <B>{N}</B><BR>in God do I trust, I will not be afraid; what can flesh do unto me?<BR>
<B>56,6</B> All the day they trouble mine affairs; all their thoughts are against me for evil.<BR>
<B>56,7</B> They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps; according as they have waited for my soul.<BR>
<B>56,8</B> Because of iniquity cast them out; in anger bring down the peoples, O God.<BR>
<B>56,9</B> Thou has counted my wanderings; put Thou my tears into Thy bottle; are they not in Thy book?<BR>
<B>56,10</B> Then shall mine enemies turn back in the day that I call; this I know, that God is for me.<BR>
<B>56,11</B> In God--I will praise His word--in the LORD--I will praise His word--<BR>
<B>56,12</B> In God do I trust, I will not be afraid; what can man do unto me?<BR>
<B>56,13</B> Thy vows are upon me, O God; I will render thank-offerings unto Thee.<BR>
<B>56,14</B> For Thou hast delivered my soul from death; hast Thou not delivered my feet from stumbling? <B>{N}</B><BR>that I may walk before God in the light of the living. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>57,1</B> For the Leader; Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam; when he fled from Saul, in the cave.<BR>
<B>57,2</B> Be gracious unto me, O God, be gracious unto me, for in Thee hath my soul taken refuge; <B>{N}</B><BR>yea, in the shadow of Thy wings will I take refuge, until calamities be overpast.<BR>
<B>57,3</B> I will cry unto God Most high; unto God that accomplisheth it for me.<BR>
<B>57,4</B> He will send from heaven, and save me, when he that would swallow me up taunteth; Selah <B>{N}</B><BR>God shall send forth His mercy and His truth.<BR>
<B>57,5</B> My soul is among lions, I do lie down among them that are aflame; <B>{N}</B><BR>even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.<BR>
<B>57,6</B> Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; Thy glory be above all the earth.<BR>
<B>57,7</B> They have prepared a net for my steps, my soul is bowed down; <B>{N}</B><BR>they have digged a pit before me, they are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. Selah<BR>
<B>57,8</B> My heart is stedfast, O God, my heart is stedfast; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises.<BR>
<B>57,9</B> Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake the dawn.<BR>
<B>57,10</B> I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations.<BR>
<B>57,11</B> For Thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and Thy truth unto the skies.<BR>
<B>57,12</B> Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; Thy glory be above all the earth. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>58,1</B> For the Leader; Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam.<BR>
<B>58,2</B> Do ye indeed speak as a righteous company? Do ye judge with equity the sons of men?<BR>
<B>58,3</B> Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh out in the earth the violence of your hands.<BR>
<B>58,4</B> The wicked are estranged from the womb; the speakers of lies go astray as soon as they are born.<BR>
<B>58,5</B> Their venom is like the venom of a serpent; they are like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ear;<BR>
<B>58,6</B> Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers, or of the most cunning binder of spells.<BR>
<B>58,7</B> Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth; break out the cheek-teeth of the young lions, O LORD.<BR>
<B>58,8</B> Let them melt away as water that runneth apace; <B>{N}</B><BR>when he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.<BR>
<B>58,9</B> Let them be as a snail which melteth and passeth away; like the untimely births of a woman, that have not seen the sun.<BR>
<B>58,10</B> Before your pots can feel the thorns, He will sweep it away with a whirlwind, the raw and the burning alike.<BR>
<B>58,11</B> The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.<BR>
<B>58,12</B> And men shall say: 'Verily there is a reward for the righteous; verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>59,1</B> For the Leader; Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David; Michtam; when Saul sent, <B>{N}</B><BR>and they watched the house to kill him.<BR>
<B>59,2</B> Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God; set me on high from them that rise up against me.<BR>
<B>59,3</B> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from the men of blood.<BR>
<B>59,4</B> For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; the impudent gather themselves together against me; <B>{N}</B><BR>not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.<BR>
<B>59,5</B> Without my fault, they run and prepare themselves; awake Thou to help me, and behold.<BR>
<B>59,6</B> Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, arouse Thyself to punish all the nations; <B>{N}</B><BR>show no mercy to any iniquitous traitors. Selah<BR>
<B>59,7</B> They return at evening, they howl like a dog, and go round about the city.<BR>
<B>59,8</B> Behold, they belch out with their mouth; swords are in their lips: 'For who doth hear?'<BR>
<B>59,9</B> But Thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; Thou shalt have all the nations in derision.<BR>
<B>59,10</B> Because of his strength, I will wait for Thee; for God is my high tower.<BR>
<B>59,11</B> The God of my mercy will come to meet me; God will let me gaze upon mine adversaries.<BR>
<B>59,12</B> Slay them not, lest my people forget, make them wander to and fro by Thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield.<BR>
<B>59,13</B> For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, <B>{N}</B><BR>let them even be taken in their pride, and for cursing and lying which they speak.<BR>
<B>59,14</B> Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they be no more; <B>{N}</B><BR>and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, unto the ends of the earth. Selah<BR>
<B>59,15</B> And they return at evening, they howl like a dog, and go round about the city;<BR>
<B>59,16</B> They wander up and down to devour, and tarry all night if they have not their fill.<BR>
<B>59,17</B> But as for me, I will sing of Thy strength; yea, I will sing aloud of Thy mercy in the morning; <B>{N}</B><BR>for Thou hast been my high tower, and a refuge in the day of my distress.<BR>
<B>59,18</B> O my strength, unto Thee will I sing praises; for God is my high tower, the God of my mercy. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>60,1</B> For the Leader; upon Shushan Eduth; Michtam of David, to teach;<BR>
<B>60,2</B> when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, <B>{N}</B><BR>and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand.<BR>
<B>60,3</B> O God, Thou hast cast us off, Thou hast broken us down; Thou hast been angry; O restore us.<BR>
<B>60,4</B> Thou hast made the land to shake, Thou hast cleft it; heal the breaches thereof; for it tottereth.<BR>
<B>60,5</B> Thou hast made Thy people to see hard things; Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering.<BR>
<B>60,6</B> Thou hast given a banner to them that fear Thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah<BR>
<B>60,7</B> That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand, and answer me.<BR>
<B>60,8</B> God spoke in His holiness, that I would exult; that I would divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.<BR>
<B>60,9</B> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.<BR>
<B>60,10</B> Moab is my washpot; upon Edom do I cast my shoe; Philistia, cry aloud because of me!<BR>
<B>60,11</B> Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me unto Edom?<BR>
<B>60,12</B> Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? And Thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.<BR>
<B>60,13</B> Give us help against the adversary; for vain is the help of man.<BR>
<B>60,14</B> Through God we shall do valiantly; for He it is that will tread down our adversaries. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>61,1</B> For the Leader; with string-music. [A Psalm] of David.<BR>
<B>61,2</B> Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.<BR>
<B>61,3</B> From the end of the earth will I call unto Thee, when my heart fainteth; <B>{N}</B><BR>lead me to a rock that is too high for me.<BR>
<B>61,4</B> For Thou hast been a refuge for me, a tower of strength in the face of the enemy.<BR>
<B>61,5</B> I will dwell in Thy Tent for ever; I will take refuge in the covert of Thy wings. Selah<BR>
<B>61,6</B> For Thou, O God, hast heard my vows; Thou hast granted the heritage of those that fear Thy name.<BR>
<B>61,7</B> Mayest Thou add days unto the king's days! May his years be as many generations!<BR>
<B>61,8</B> May he be enthroned before God for ever! Appoint mercy and truth, that they may preserve him.<BR>
<B>61,9</B> So will I sing praise unto Thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>62,1</B> For the Leader; for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>62,2</B> Only for God doth my soul wait in stillness; from Him cometh my salvation.<BR>
<B>62,3</B> He only is my rock and my salvation, my high tower, I shall not be greatly moved.<BR>
<B>62,4</B> How long will ye set upon a man, that ye may slay him, all of you, <B>{N}</B><BR>as a leaning wall, a tottering fence?<BR>
<B>62,5</B> They only devise to thrust him down from his height, delighting in lies; <B>{N}</B><BR>they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah<BR>
<B>62,6</B> Only for God wait thou in stillness, my soul; for from Him cometh my hope.<BR>
<B>62,7</B> He only is my rock and my salvation, my high tower, I shall not be moved.<BR>
<B>62,8</B> Upon God resteth my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.<BR>
<B>62,9</B> Trust in Him at all times, ye people; pour out your heart before Him; <B>{N}</B><BR>God is a refuge for us. Selah<BR>
<B>62,10</B> Men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; <B>{N}</B><BR>if they be laid in the balances, they are together lighter than vanity.<BR>
<B>62,11</B> Trust not in oppression, and put not vain hope in robbery; <B>{N}</B><BR>if riches increase, set not your heart thereon.<BR>
<B>62,12</B> God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this: that strength belongeth unto God;<BR>
<B>62,13</B> Also unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy; for Thou renderest to every man according to his work. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>63,1</B> A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.<BR>
<B>63,2</B> O God, Thou art my God, earnestly will I seek Thee; <B>{N}</B><BR>my soul thirsteth for Thee, my flesh longeth for Thee, <B>{N}</B><BR>in a dry and weary land, where no water is.<BR>
<B>63,3</B> So have I looked for Thee in the sanctuary, to see Thy power and Thy glory.<BR>
<B>63,4</B> For Thy lovingkindness is better than life; my lips shall praise Thee.<BR>
<B>63,5</B> So will I bless Thee as long as I live; in Thy name will I lift up my hands.<BR>
<B>63,6</B> My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth doth praise Thee with joyful lips;<BR>
<B>63,7</B> When I remember Thee upon my couch, and meditate on Thee in the night-watches.<BR>
<B>63,8</B> For Thou hast been my help, and in the shadow of Thy wings do I rejoice.<BR>
<B>63,9</B> My soul cleaveth unto Thee; Thy right hand holdeth me fast.<BR>
<B>63,10</B> But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the nethermost parts of the earth.<BR>
<B>63,11</B> They shall be hurled to the power of the sword; they shall be a portion for foxes.<BR>
<B>63,12</B> But the king shall rejoice in God; <B>{N}</B><BR>every one that sweareth by Him shall glory; for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>64,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>64,2</B> Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; preserve my life from the terror of the enemy.<BR>
<B>64,3</B> Hide me from the council of evil-doers; from the tumult of the workers of iniquity;<BR>
<B>64,4</B> Who have whet their tongue like a sword, and have aimed their arrow, a poisoned word;<BR>
<B>64,5</B> That they may shoot in secret places at the blameless; suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.<BR>
<B>64,6</B> They encourage one another in an evil matter; they converse of laying snares secretly; <B>{N}</B><BR>they ask, who would see them.<BR>
<B>64,7</B> They search out iniquities, they have accomplished a diligent search; <B>{N}</B><BR>even in the inward thought of every one, and the deep heart.<BR>
<B>64,8</B> But God doth shoot at them with an arrow suddenly; thence are their wounds.<BR>
<B>64,9</B> So they make their own tongue a stumbling unto themselves; all that see them shake the head.<BR>
<B>64,10</B> And all men fear; and they declare the work of God, and understand His doing.<BR>
<B>64,11</B> The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall take refuge in Him; and all the upright in heart shall glory. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>65,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm. A Song of David.<BR>
<B>65,2</B> Praise waiteth for Thee, O God, in Zion; and unto Thee the vow is performed.<BR>
<B>65,3</B> O Thou that hearest prayer, unto Thee doth all flesh come.<BR>
<B>65,4</B> The tale of iniquities is too heavy for me; as for our transgressions, Thou wilt pardon them.<BR>
<B>65,5</B> Happy is the man whom Thou choosest, and bringest near, that he may dwell in Thy courts; <B>{N}</B><BR>may we be satisfied with the goodness of Thy house, the holy place of Thy temple!<BR>
<B>65,6</B> With wondrous works dost Thou answer us in righteousness, O God of our salvation; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of the far distant seas;<BR>
<B>65,7</B> Who by Thy strength settest fast the mountains, who art girded about with might;<BR>
<B>65,8</B> Who stillest the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples;<BR>
<B>65,9</B> So that they that dwell in the uttermost parts stand in awe of Thy signs; Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.<BR>
<B>65,10</B> Thou hast remembered the earth, and watered her, greatly enriching her, with the river of God that is full of water; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou preparest them corn, for so preparest Thou her.<BR>
<B>65,11</B> Watering her ridges abundantly, settling down the furrows thereof, Thou makest her soft with showers; Thou blessest the growth thereof.<BR>
<B>65,12</B> Thou crownest the year with Thy goodness; and Thy paths drop fatness.<BR>
<B>65,13</B> The pastures of the wilderness do drop; and the hills are girded with joy.<BR>
<B>65,14</B> The meadows are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; <B>{N}</B><BR>they shout for joy, yea, they sing. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>66,1</B> For the Leader. A Song, a Psalm. Shout unto God, all the earth;<BR>
<B>66,2</B> Sing praises unto the glory of His name; make His praise glorious.<BR>
<B>66,3</B> Say unto God: 'How tremendous is Thy work! Through the greatness of Thy power shall Thine enemies dwindle away before Thee.<BR>
<B>66,4</B> All the earth shall worship Thee, and shall sing praises unto Thee; they shall sing praises to Thy name.' Selah<BR>
<B>66,5</B> Come, and see the works of God; He is terrible in His doing toward the children of men.<BR>
<B>66,6</B> He turned the sea into dry land; they went through the river on foot; there let us rejoice in Him!<BR>
<B>66,7</B> Who ruleth by His might for ever; His eyes keep watch upon the nations; <B>{N}</B><BR>let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah<BR>
<B>66,8</B> Bless our God, ye peoples, and make the voice of His praise to be heard;<BR>
<B>66,9</B> Who hath set our soul in life, and suffered not our foot to be moved,<BR>
<B>66,10</B> For Thou, O God, hast tried us; Thou hast refined us, as silver is refined.<BR>
<B>66,11</B> Thou didst bring us into the hold; Thou didst lay constraint upon our loins.<BR>
<B>66,12</B> Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; but Thou didst bring us out unto abundance.<BR>
<B>66,13</B> I will come into Thy house with burnt-offerings, I will perform unto Thee my vows,<BR>
<B>66,14</B> Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in distress.<BR>
<B>66,15</B> I will offer unto Thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, with the sweet smoke of rams; <B>{N}</B><BR>I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah<BR>
<B>66,16</B> Come, and hearken, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what He hath done for my soul.<BR>
<B>66,17</B> I cried unto Him with my mouth, and He was extolled with my tongue.<BR>
<B>66,18</B> If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear;<BR>
<B>66,19</B> But verily God hath heard; He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.<BR>
<B>66,20</B> Blessed be God, who hath not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>67,1</B> For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm, a Song.<BR>
<B>67,2</B> God be gracious unto us, and bless us; may He cause His face to shine toward us; Selah<BR>
<B>67,3</B> That Thy way may be known upon earth, Thy salvation among all nations.<BR>
<B>67,4</B> Let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, O God; let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, all of them.<BR>
<B>67,5</B> O let the nations be glad and sing for joy; <B>{N}</B><BR>for Thou wilt judge the peoples with equity, and lead the nations upon earth. Selah<BR>
<B>67,6</B> Let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, O God; let the peoples give thanks unto Thee, all of them.<BR>
<B>67,7</B> The earth hath yielded her increase; may God, our own God, bless us.<BR>
<B>67,8</B> May God bless us; and let all the ends of the earth fear Him. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>68,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of David, a Song.<BR>
<B>68,2</B> Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered; and let them that hate Him flee before Him.<BR>
<B>68,3</B> As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; <B>{N}</B><BR>as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.<BR>
<B>68,4</B> But let the righteous be glad, let them exult before God; yea, let them rejoice with gladness.<BR>
<B>68,5</B> Sing unto God, sing praises to His name; <B>{N}</B><BR>extol Him that rideth upon the skies, whose name is the LORD; and exult ye before Him.<BR>
<B>68,6</B> A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in His holy habitation.<BR>
<B>68,7</B> God maketh the solitary to dwell in a house; He bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity; <B>{N}</B><BR>the rebellious dwell but in a parched land.<BR>
<B>68,8</B> O God, when Thou wentest forth before Thy people, when Thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah<BR>
<B>68,9</B> The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God; <B>{N}</B><BR>even yon Sinai trembled at the presence of God, the God of Israel.<BR>
<B>68,10</B> A bounteous rain didst Thou pour down, O God; when Thine inheritance was weary, Thou didst confirm it.<BR>
<B>68,11</B> Thy flock settled therein; Thou didst prepare in Thy goodness for the poor, O God.<BR>
<B>68,12</B> The Lord giveth the word; the women that proclaim the tidings are a great host.<BR>
<B>68,13</B> Kings of armies flee, they flee; and she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil.<BR>
<B>68,14</B> When ye lie among the sheepfolds, <B>{N}</B><BR>the wings of the dove are covered with silver, and her pinions with the shimmer of gold.<BR>
<B>68,15</B> When the Almighty scattereth kings therein, it snoweth in Zalmon.<BR>
<B>68,16</B> A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; a mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan.<BR>
<B>68,17</B> Why look ye askance, ye mountains of peaks, <B>{N}</B><BR>at the mountain which God hath desired for His abode? Yea, the LORD will dwell therein for ever.<BR>
<B>68,18</B> The chariots of God are myriads, even thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in holiness.<BR>
<B>68,19</B> Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captivity captive; Thou hast received gifts among men, <B>{N}</B><BR>yea, among the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell there.<BR>
<B>68,20</B> Blessed be the Lord, day by day He beareth our burden, even the God who is our salvation. Selah<BR>
<B>68,21</B> God is unto us a God of deliverances; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues of death.<BR>
<B>68,22</B> Surely God will smite through the head of His enemies, the hairy scalp of him that goeth about in his guiltiness.<BR>
<B>68,23</B> The Lord said: 'I will bring back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea;<BR>
<B>68,24</B> That thy foot may wade through blood, that the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from thine enemies.'<BR>
<B>68,25</B> They see Thy goings, O God, even the goings of my God, my King, in holiness.<BR>
<B>68,26</B> The singers go before, the minstrels follow after, in the midst of damsels playing upon timbrels.<BR>
<B>68,27</B> 'Bless ye God in full assemblies, even the Lord, ye that are from the fountain of Israel.'<BR>
<B>68,28</B> There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling them, the princes of Judah their council, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.<BR>
<B>68,29</B> Thy God hath commanded thy strength; be strong, O God, Thou that hast wrought for us<BR>
<B>68,30</B> Out of Thy temple at Jerusalem, whither kings shall bring presents unto Thee.<BR>
<B>68,31</B> Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples, every one submitting himself with pieces of silver; <B>{N}</B><BR>He hath scattered the peoples that delight in war!<BR>
<B>68,32</B> Nobles shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall hasten to stretch out her hands unto God.<BR>
<B>68,33</B> Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah<BR>
<B>68,34</B> To Him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which are of old; lo, He uttereth His voice, a mighty voice.<BR>
<B>68,35</B> Ascribe ye strength unto God; His majesty is over Israel, and His strength is in the skies.<BR>
<B>68,36</B> Awful is God out of thy holy places; <B>{N}</B><BR>the God of Israel, He giveth strength and power unto the people; <B>{N}</B><BR>blessed be God. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>69,1</B> For the Leader; upon Shoshannim. [A Psalm] of David.<BR>
<B>69,2</B> Save me, O God; for the waters are come in even unto the soul.<BR>
<B>69,3</B> I am sunk in deep mire, where there is no standing; <B>{N}</B><BR>I am come into deep waters, and the flood overwhelmeth me.<BR>
<B>69,4</B> I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried; mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.<BR>
<B>69,5</B> They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; <B>{N}</B><BR>they that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are many; should I restore that which I took not away?<BR>
<B>69,6</B> O God, Thou knowest my folly; and my trespasses are not hid from Thee.<BR>
<B>69,7</B> Let not them that wait for Thee be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of hosts; <B>{N}</B><BR>let not those that seek Thee be brought to confusion through me, O God of Israel.<BR>
<B>69,8</B> Because for Thy sake I have borne reproach; confusion hath covered my face.<BR>
<B>69,9</B> I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.<BR>
<B>69,10</B> Because zeal for Thy house hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them that reproach Thee are fallen upon me.<BR>
<B>69,11</B> And I wept with my soul fasting, and that became unto me a reproach.<BR>
<B>69,12</B> I made sackcloth also my garment, and I became a byword unto them.<BR>
<B>69,13</B> They that sit in the gate talk of me; and I am the song of the drunkards.<BR>
<B>69,14</B> But as for me, let my prayer be unto Thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time; O God, in the abundance of Thy mercy, <B>{N}</B><BR>answer me with the truth of Thy salvation.<BR>
<B>69,15</B> Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.<BR>
<B>69,16</B> Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up; <B>{N}</B><BR>and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.<BR>
<B>69,17</B> Answer me, O LORD, for Thy mercy is good; according to the multitude of Thy compassions turn Thou unto me.<BR>
<B>69,18</B> And hide not Thy face from Thy servant; for I am in distress; answer me speedily.<BR>
<B>69,19</B> Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it; ransom me because of mine enemies.<BR>
<B>69,20</B> Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my confusion; mine adversaries are all before Thee.<BR>
<B>69,21</B> Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am sore sick; <B>{N}</B><BR>and I looked for some to show compassion, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.<BR>
<B>69,22</B> Yea, they put poison into my food; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.<BR>
<B>69,23</B> Let their table before them become a snare; and when they are in peace, let it become a trap.<BR>
<B>69,24</B> Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to totter.<BR>
<B>69,25</B> Pour out Thine indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of Thine anger overtake them.<BR>
<B>69,26</B> Let their encampment be desolate; let none dwell in their tents.<BR>
<B>69,27</B> For they persecute him whom Thou hast smitten; and they tell of the pain of those whom Thou hast wounded.<BR>
<B>69,28</B> Add iniquity unto their iniquity; and let them not come into Thy righteousness.<BR>
<B>69,29</B> Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.<BR>
<B>69,30</B> But I am afflicted and in pain; let Thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.<BR>
<B>69,31</B> I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify Him with thanksgiving.<BR>
<B>69,32</B> And it shall please the LORD better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.<BR>
<B>69,33</B> The humble shall see it, and be glad; ye that seek after God, let your heart revive.<BR>
<B>69,34</B> For the LORD hearkeneth unto the needy, and despiseth not His prisoners.<BR>
<B>69,35</B> Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.<BR>
<B>69,36</B> For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; and they shall abide there, and have it in possession.<BR>
<B>69,37</B> The seed also of His servants shall inherit it; and they that love His name shall dwell therein. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>70,1</B> For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David; to make memorial. <B>70,2</B> O God, to deliver me, O LORD, to help me, make haste.<BR>
<B>70,3</B> Let them be ashamed and abashed that seek after my soul; let them be turned backward and brought to confusion that delight in my hurt.<BR>
<B>70,4</B> Let them be turned back by reason of their shame that say: 'Aha, aha.'<BR>
<B>70,5</B> Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; <B>{N}</B><BR>and let such as love Thy salvation say continually: 'Let God be magnified.'<BR>
<B>70,6</B> But I am poor and needy; O God, make haste unto me; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, tarry not. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>71,1</B> In Thee, O LORD, have I taken refuge; let me never be ashamed.<BR>
<B>71,2</B> Deliver me in Thy righteousness, and rescue me; incline Thine ear unto me, and save me.<BR>
<B>71,3</B> Be Thou to me a sheltering rock, whereunto I may continually resort, which Thou hast appointed to save me; <B>{N}</B><BR>for Thou art my rock and my fortress.<BR>
<B>71,4</B> O my God, rescue me out of the hand of the wicked, out of the grasp of the unrighteous and ruthless man.<BR>
<B>71,5</B> For Thou art my hope; O Lord GOD, my trust from my youth.<BR>
<B>71,6</B> Upon Thee have I stayed myself from birth; Thou art He that took me out of my mother's womb; my praise is continually of Thee.<BR>
<B>71,7</B> I am as a wonder unto many; but Thou art my strong refuge.<BR>
<B>71,8</B> My mouth shall be filled with Thy praise, and with Thy glory all the day.<BR>
<B>71,9</B> Cast me not off in the time of old age; when my strength faileth, forsake me not.<BR>
<B>71,10</B> For mine enemies speak concerning me, and they that watch for my soul take counsel together,<BR>
<B>71,11</B> Saying: 'God hath forsaken him; pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver.'<BR>
<B>71,12</B> O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me.<BR>
<B>71,13</B> Let them be ashamed and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and confusion that seek my hurt.<BR>
<B>71,14</B> But as for me, I will hope continually, and will praise Thee yet more and more.<BR>
<B>71,15</B> My mouth shall tell of Thy righteousness, and of Thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.<BR>
<B>71,16</B> I will come with Thy mighty acts, O Lord GOD; I will make mention of Thy righteousness, even of Thine only.<BR>
<B>71,17</B> O God, Thou hast taught me from my youth; and until now do I declare Thy wondrous works.<BR>
<B>71,18</B> And even unto old age and hoary hairs, O God, forsake me not; <B>{N}</B><BR>until I have declared Thy strength unto the next generation, Thy might to every one that is to come.<BR>
<B>71,19</B> Thy righteousness also, O God, which reacheth unto high heaven; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou who hast done great things, O God, who is like unto Thee?<BR>
<B>71,20</B> Thou, who hast made me to see many and sore troubles, <B>{N}</B><BR>wilt quicken me again, and bring me up again from the depths of the earth.<BR>
<B>71,21</B> Thou wilt increase my greatness, and turn and comfort me.<BR>
<B>71,22</B> I also will give thanks unto Thee with the psaltery, even unto Thy truth, O my God; <B>{N}</B><BR>I will sing praises unto Thee with the harp, O Thou Holy One of Israel.<BR>
<B>71,23</B> My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing praises unto Thee; and my soul, which Thou hast redeemed.<BR>
<B>71,24</B> My tongue also shall tell of Thy righteousness all the day; <B>{N}</B><BR>for they are ashamed, for they are abashed, that seek my hurt. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>72,1</B> [A Psalm] of Solomon. Give the king Thy judgments, O God, and Thy righteousness unto the king's son;<BR>
<B>72,2</B> That he may judge Thy people with righteousness, and Thy poor with justice.<BR>
<B>72,3</B> Let the mountains bear peace to the people, and the hills, through righteousness.<BR>
<B>72,4</B> May he judge the poor of the people, and save the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor.<BR>
<B>72,5</B> They shall fear Thee while the sun endureth, and so long as the moon, throughout all generations.<BR>
<B>72,6</B> May he come down like rain upon the mown grass, as showers that water the earth.<BR>
<B>72,7</B> In his days let the righteous flourish, and abundance of peace, till the moon be no more.<BR>
<B>72,8</B> May he have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the River unto the ends of the earth.<BR>
<B>72,9</B> Let them that dwell in the wilderness bow before him; and his enemies lick the dust.<BR>
<B>72,10</B> The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render tribute; <B>{N}</B><BR>the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.<BR>
<B>72,11</B> Yea, all kings shall prostrate themselves before him; all nations shall serve him.<BR>
<B>72,12</B> For he will deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.<BR>
<B>72,13</B> He will have pity on the poor and needy, and the souls of the needy he will save.<BR>
<B>72,14</B> He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence, and precious will their blood be in his sight;<BR>
<B>72,15</B> That they may live, and that he may give them of the gold of Sheba, <B>{N}</B><BR>that they may pray for him continually, yea, bless him all the day.<BR>
<B>72,16</B> May he be as a rich cornfield in the land upon the top of the mountains; <B>{N}</B><BR>may his fruit rustle like Lebanon; and may they blossom out of the city like grass of the earth.<BR>
<B>72,17</B> May his name endure for ever; may his name be continued as long as the sun; <B>{N}</B><BR>may men also bless themselves by him; may all nations call him happy.<BR>
<B>72,18</B> Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things;<BR>
<B>72,19</B> And blessed be His glorious name for ever; <B>{N}</B><BR>and let the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen, and Amen.<BR>
<B>72,20</B> The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>73,1</B> A Psalm of Asaph. <B>{N}</B><BR>Surely God is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart.<BR>
<B>73,2</B> But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.<BR>
<B>73,3</B> For I was envious at the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.<BR>
<B>73,4</B> For there are no pangs at their death, and their body is sound.<BR>
<B>73,5</B> In the trouble of man they are not; neither are they plagued like men.<BR>
<B>73,6</B> Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; violence covereth them as a garment.<BR>
<B>73,7</B> Their eyes stand forth from fatness; they are gone beyond the imaginations of their heart.<BR>
<B>73,8</B> They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression; they speak as if there were none on high.<BR>
<B>73,9</B> They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.<BR>
<B>73,10</B> Therefore His people return hither; and waters of fullness are drained out by them.<BR>
<B>73,11</B> And they say: 'How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?'<BR>
<B>73,12</B> Behold, such are the wicked; and they that are always at ease increase riches.<BR>
<B>73,13</B> Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, and washed my hands in innocency;<BR>
<B>73,14</B> For all the day have I been plagued, and my chastisement came every morning.<BR>
<B>73,15</B> If I had said: 'I will speak thus', behold, I had been faithless to the generation of Thy children.<BR>
<B>73,16</B> And when I pondered how I might know this, it was wearisome in mine eyes;<BR>
<B>73,17</B> Until I entered into the sanctuary of God, and considered their end.<BR>
<B>73,18</B> Surely Thou settest them in slippery places; Thou hurlest them down to utter ruin.<BR>
<B>73,19</B> How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are wholly consumed by terrors.<BR>
<B>73,20</B> As a dream when one awaketh, so, O Lord, when Thou arousest Thyself, Thou wilt despise their semblance.<BR>
<B>73,21</B> For my heart was in a ferment, and I was pricked in my reins.<BR>
<B>73,22</B> But I was brutish, and ignorant; I was as a beast before Thee.<BR>
<B>73,23</B> Nevertheless I am continually with Thee; Thou holdest my right hand.<BR>
<B>73,24</B> Thou wilt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive me with glory.<BR>
<B>73,25</B> Whom have I in heaven but Thee? And beside Thee I desire none upon earth.<BR>
<B>73,26</B> My flesh and my heart faileth; but God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever.<BR>
<B>73,27</B> For, lo, they that go far from Thee shall perish; Thou dost destroy all them that go astray from Thee.<BR>
<B>73,28</B> But as for me, the nearness of God is my good; <B>{N}</B><BR>I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, that I may tell of all Thy works. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>74,1</B> Maschil of Asaph. <B>{N}</B><BR>Why, O God, hast Thou cast us off for ever? Why doth Thine anger smoke against the flock of Thy pasture?<BR>
<B>74,2</B> Remember Thy congregation, which Thou hast gotten of old, which Thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of Thine inheritance; <B>{N}</B><BR>and mount Zion, wherein Thou hast dwelt.<BR>
<B>74,3</B> Lift up Thy steps because of the perpetual ruins, even all the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.<BR>
<B>74,4</B> Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of Thy meeting-place; they have set up their own signs for signs.<BR>
<B>74,5</B> It seemed as when men wield upwards axes in a thicket of trees.<BR>
<B>74,6</B> And now all the carved work thereof together they strike down with hatchet and hammers.<BR>
<B>74,7</B> They have set Thy sanctuary on fire; they have profaned the dwelling-place of Thy name even to the ground.<BR>
<B>74,8</B> They said in their heart: 'Let us make havoc of them altogether'; they have burned up all the meeting-places of God in the land.<BR>
<B>74,9</B> We see not our signs; there is no more any prophet; neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.<BR>
<B>74,10</B> How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme Thy name for ever?<BR>
<B>74,11</B> Why withdrawest Thou Thy hand, even Thy right hand? Draw it out of Thy bosom and consume them.<BR>
<B>74,12</B> Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.<BR>
<B>74,13</B> Thou didst break the sea in pieces by Thy strength; Thou didst shatter the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.<BR>
<B>74,14</B> Thou didst crush the heads of leviathan, Thou gavest him to be food to the folk inhabiting the wilderness.<BR>
<B>74,15</B> Thou didst cleave fountain and brook; Thou driedst up ever-flowing rivers.<BR>
<B>74,16</B> Thine is the day, Thine also the night; Thou hast established luminary and sun.<BR>
<B>74,17</B> Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; Thou hast made summer and winter.<BR>
<B>74,18</B> Remember this, how the enemy hath reproached the LORD, and how a base people have blasphemed Thy name.<BR>
<B>74,19</B> O deliver not the soul of Thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast; forget not the life of Thy poor for ever.<BR>
<B>74,20</B> Look upon the covenant; for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.<BR>
<B>74,21</B> O let not the oppressed turn back in confusion; let the poor and needy praise Thy name.<BR>
<B>74,22</B> Arise, O God, plead Thine own cause; remember Thy reproach all the day at the hand of the base man.<BR>
<B>74,23</B> Forget not the voice of Thine adversaries, the tumult of those that rise up against Thee which ascendeth continually. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>75,1</B> For the Leader; Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song.<BR>
<B>75,2</B> We give thanks unto Thee, O God, we give thanks, and Thy name is near; men tell of Thy wondrous works.<BR>
<B>75,3</B> 'When I take the appointed time, I Myself will judge with equity.<BR>
<B>75,4</B> When the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved, I Myself establish the pillars of it.' Selah<BR>
<B>75,5</B> I say unto the arrogant: 'Deal not arrogantly'; and to the wicked: 'Lift not up the horn.'<BR>
<B>75,6</B> Lift not up your horn on high; speak not insolence with a haughty neck.<BR>
<B>75,7</B> For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the wilderness, cometh lifting up.<BR>
<B>75,8</B> For God is judge; He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.<BR>
<B>75,9</B> For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, with foaming wine, full of mixture, and He poureth out of the same; <B>{N}</B><BR>surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.<BR>
<B>75,10</B> But as for me, I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.<BR>
<B>75,11</B> All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>76,1</B> For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song.<BR>
<B>76,2</B> In Judah is God known; His name is great in Israel.<BR>
<B>76,3</B> In Salem also is set His tabernacle, and His dwelling-place in Zion.<BR>
<B>76,4</B> There He broke the fiery shafts of the bow; the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah<BR>
<B>76,5</B> Glorious art Thou and excellent, coming down from the mountains of prey.<BR>
<B>76,6</B> The stout-hearted are bereft of sense, they sleep their sleep; <B>{N}</B><BR>and none of the men of might have found their hands.<BR>
<B>76,7</B> At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they are cast into a dead sleep, the riders also and the horses.<BR>
<B>76,8</B> Thou, even Thou, art terrible; and who may stand in Thy sight when once Thou art angry?<BR>
<B>76,9</B> Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,<BR>
<B>76,10</B> When God arose to judgment, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah<BR>
<B>76,11</B> Surely the wrath of man shall praise Thee; the residue of wrath shalt Thou gird upon Thee.<BR>
<B>76,12</B> Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God; let all that are round about Him bring presents unto Him that is to be feared;<BR>
<B>76,13</B> He minisheth the spirit of princes; He is terrible to the kings of the earth. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>77,1</B> For the Leader; for Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.<BR>
<B>77,2</B> I will lift up my voice unto God, and cry; I will lift up my voice unto God, that He may give ear unto me.<BR>
<B>77,3</B> In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; <B>{N}</B><BR>with my hand uplifted, [mine eye] streameth in the night without ceasing; my soul refuseth to be comforted.<BR>
<B>77,4</B> When I think thereon, O God, I must moan; when I muse thereon, my spirit fainteth. Selah<BR>
<B>77,5</B> Thou holdest fast the lids of mine eyes; I am troubled, and cannot speak.<BR>
<B>77,6</B> I have pondered the days of old, the years of ancient times.<BR>
<B>77,7</B> In the night I will call to remembrance my song; I will commune with mine own heart; and my spirit maketh diligent search:<BR>
<B>77,8</B> 'Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will He be favourable no more?<BR>
<B>77,9</B> Is His mercy clean gone for ever? Is His promise come to an end for evermore?<BR>
<B>77,10</B> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath He in anger shut up his compassions?' Selah<BR>
<B>77,11</B> And I say: 'This is my weakness, that the right hand of the Most High could change.<BR>
<B>77,12</B> I will make mention of the deeds of the LORD; yea, I will remember Thy wonders of old.<BR>
<B>77,13</B> I will meditate also upon all Thy work, and muse on Thy doings.'<BR>
<B>77,14</B> O God, Thy way is in holiness; who is a great god like unto God?<BR>
<B>77,15</B> Thou art the God that doest wonders; Thou hast made known Thy strength among the peoples.<BR>
<B>77,16</B> Thou hast with Thine arm redeemed Thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah<BR>
<B>77,17</B> The waters saw Thee, O God; the waters saw Thee, they were in pain; the depths also trembled.<BR>
<B>77,18</B> The clouds flooded forth waters; the skies sent out a sound; Thine arrows also went abroad.<BR>
<B>77,19</B> The voice of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook.<BR>
<B>77,20</B> Thy way was in the sea, and Thy path in the great waters, and Thy footsteps were not known.<BR>
<B>77,21</B> Thou didst lead Thy people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>78,1</B> Maschil of Asaph. <B>{N}</B><BR>Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<BR>
<B>78,2</B> I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter dark sayings concerning days of old;<BR>
<B>78,3</B> That which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us,<BR>
<B>78,4</B> We will not hide from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, <B>{N}</B><BR>and His strength, and His wondrous works that He hath done.<BR>
<B>78,5</B> For He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, <B>{N}</B><BR>which He commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;<BR>
<B>78,6</B> That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; who should arise and tell them to their children,<BR>
<B>78,7</B> That they might put their confidence in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments;<BR>
<B>78,8</B> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; <B>{N}</B><BR>a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.<BR>
<B>78,9</B> The children of Ephraim were as archers handling the bow, that turned back in the day of battle.<BR>
<B>78,10</B> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in His law;<BR>
<B>78,11</B> And they forgot His doings, and His wondrous works that He had shown them.<BR>
<B>78,12</B> Marvellous things did He in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<BR>
<B>78,13</B> He cleaved the sea, and caused them to pass through; and He made the waters to stand as a heap.<BR>
<B>78,14</B> By day also He led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.<BR>
<B>78,15</B> He cleaved rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the great deep.<BR>
<B>78,16</B> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.<BR>
<B>78,17</B> Yet went they on still to sin against Him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.<BR>
<B>78,18</B> And they tried God in their heart by asking food for their craving.<BR>
<B>78,19</B> Yea, they spoke against God; they said: 'Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?<BR>
<B>78,20</B> Behold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; <B>{N}</B><BR>can He give bread also? or will He provide flesh for His people?'<BR>
<B>78,21</B> Therefore the LORD heard, and was wroth; <B>{N}</B><BR>and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel;<BR>
<B>78,22</B> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in His salvation.<BR>
<B>78,23</B> And He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven;<BR>
<B>78,24</B> And He caused manna to rain upon them for food, and gave them of the corn of heaven.<BR>
<B>78,25</B> Man did eat the bread of the mighty; He sent them provisions to the full.<BR>
<B>78,26</B> He caused the east wind to set forth in heaven; and by His power He brought on the south wind.<BR>
<B>78,27</B> He caused flesh also to rain upon them as the dust, and winged fowl as the sand of the seas;<BR>
<B>78,28</B> And He let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their dwellings.<BR>
<B>78,29</B> So they did eat, and were well filled; and He gave them that which they craved.<BR>
<B>78,30</B> They were not estranged from their craving, their food was yet in their mouths,<BR>
<B>78,31</B> When the anger of God went up against them, and slew of the lustieth among them, <B>{N}</B><BR>and smote down the young men of Israel.<BR>
<B>78,32</B> For all this they sinned still, and believed not in His wondrous works.<BR>
<B>78,33</B> Therefore He ended their days as a breath, and their years in terror.<BR>
<B>78,34</B> When He slew them, then they would inquire after Him, and turn back and seek God earnestly.<BR>
<B>78,35</B> And they remembered that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.<BR>
<B>78,36</B> But they beguiled Him with their mouth, and lied unto Him with their tongue.<BR>
<B>78,37</B> For their heart was not stedfast with Him, neither were they faithful in His covenant.<BR>
<B>78,38</B> But He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not; <B>{N}</B><BR>yea, many a time doth He turn His anger away, and doth not stir up all His wrath.<BR>
<B>78,39</B> So He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.<BR>
<B>78,40</B> How oft did they rebel against Him in the wilderness, and grieve Him in the desert!<BR>
<B>78,41</B> And still again they tried God, and set bounds to the Holy One of Israel.<BR>
<B>78,42</B> They remembered not His hand, nor the day when He redeemed them from the adversary.<BR>
<B>78,43</B> How He set His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the field of Zoan;<BR>
<B>78,44</B> And turned their rivers into blood, so that they could not drink their streams.<BR>
<B>78,45</B> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.<BR>
<B>78,46</B> He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust.<BR>
<B>78,47</B> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore-trees with frost.<BR>
<B>78,48</B> He gave over their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to fiery bolts.<BR>
<B>78,49</B> He sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a sending of messengers of evil.<BR>
<B>78,50</B> He levelled a path for His anger; He spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;<BR>
<B>78,51</B> And smote all the first-born in Egypt, the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham;<BR>
<B>78,52</B> But He made His own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<BR>
<B>78,53</B> And He led them safely, and they feared not; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<BR>
<B>78,54</B> And He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain, which His right hand had gotten.<BR>
<B>78,55</B> He drove out the nations also before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, <B>{N}</B><BR>and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<BR>
<B>78,56</B> Yet they tried and provoked God, the Most High, and kept not His testimonies;<BR>
<B>78,57</B> But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers; they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.<BR>
<B>78,58</B> For they provoked Him with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.<BR>
<B>78,59</B> God heard, and was wroth, and He greatly abhorred Israel;<BR>
<B>78,60</B> And He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He had made to dwell among men;<BR>
<B>78,61</B> And delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the adversary's hand.<BR>
<B>78,62</B> He gave His people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with His inheritance.<BR>
<B>78,63</B> Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins had no marriage-song.<BR>
<B>78,64</B> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.<BR>
<B>78,65</B> Then the Lord awaked as one asleep, like a mighty man recovering from wine.<BR>
<B>78,66</B> And He smote His adversaries backward; He put upon them a perpetual reproach.<BR>
<B>78,67</B> Moreover He abhorred the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;<BR>
<B>78,68</B> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which He loved.<BR>
<B>78,69</B> And He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which He hath founded for ever.<BR>
<B>78,70</B> He chose David also His servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;<BR>
<B>78,71</B> From following the ewes that give suck He brought him, to be shepherd over Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.<BR>
<B>78,72</B> So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart; and lead them by the skilfulness of his hands. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>79,1</B> A Psalm of Asaph. <B>{N}</B><BR>O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance; they have defiled Thy holy temple; <B>{N}</B><BR>they have made Jerusalem into heaps.<BR>
<B>79,2</B> They have given the dead bodies of Thy servants to be food unto the fowls of the heaven, <B>{N}</B><BR>the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.<BR>
<B>79,3</B> They have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem, with none to bury them.<BR>
<B>79,4</B> We are become a taunt to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.<BR>
<B>79,5</B> How long, O LORD, wilt Thou be angry for ever? How long will Thy jealousy burn like fire?<BR>
<B>79,6</B> Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not, <B>{N}</B><BR>and upon the kingdoms that call not upon Thy name.<BR>
<B>79,7</B> For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his habitation.<BR>
<B>79,8</B> Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers; <B>{N}</B><BR>let Thy compassions speedily come to meet us; for we are brought very low.<BR>
<B>79,9</B> Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of Thy name; <B>{N}</B><BR>and deliver us, and forgive our sins, for Thy name's sake.<BR>
<B>79,10</B> Wherefore should the nations say: 'Where is their God?' <B>{N}</B><BR>Let the avenging of Thy servants' blood that is shed be made known among the nations in our sight.<BR>
<B>79,11</B> Let the groaning of the prisoner come before Thee; according to the greatness of Thy power set free those that are appointed to death;<BR>
<B>79,12</B> And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, <B>{N}</B><BR>wherewith they have reproached Thee, O Lord.<BR>
<B>79,13</B> So we that are Thy people and the flock of Thy pasture will give Thee thanks for ever; <B>{N}</B><BR>we will tell of Thy praise to all generations. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>80,1</B> For the Leader; upon Shoshannim. A testimony. A Psalm of Asaph.<BR>
<B>80,2</B> Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou that art enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth.<BR>
<B>80,3</B> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up Thy might, <B>{N}</B><BR>and come to save us.<BR>
<B>80,4</B> O God, restore us; and cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.<BR>
<B>80,5</B> O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt Thou be angry against the prayer of Thy people?<BR>
<B>80,6</B> Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in large measure.<BR>
<B>80,7</B> Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours; and our enemies mock as they please.<BR>
<B>80,8</B> O God of hosts, restore us; and cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.<BR>
<B>80,9</B> Thou didst pluck up a vine out of Egypt; Thou didst drive out the nations, and didst plant it.<BR>
<B>80,10</B> Thou didst clear a place before it, and it took deep root, and filled the land.<BR>
<B>80,11</B> The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, and the mighty cedars with the boughs thereof.<BR>
<B>80,12</B> She sent out her branches unto the sea, and her shoots unto the River.<BR>
<B>80,13</B> Why hast Thou broken down her fences, so that all they that pass by the way do pluck her?<BR>
<B>80,14</B> The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, that which moveth in the field feedeth on it.<BR>
<B>80,15</B> O God of hosts, return, we beseech Thee; <B>{N}</B><BR>look from heaven, and behold, and be mindful of this vine,<BR>
<B>80,16</B> And of the stock which Thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that Thou madest strong for Thyself.<BR>
<B>80,17</B> It is burned with fire, it is cut down; they perish at the rebuke of Thy countenance.<BR>
<B>80,18</B> Let Thy hand be upon the man of Thy right hand, upon the son of man whom Thou madest strong for Thyself.<BR>
<B>80,19</B> So shall we not turn back from Thee; quicken Thou us, and we will call upon Thy name.<BR>
<B>80,20</B> O LORD God of hosts, restore us; cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>81,1</B> For the Leader; upon the Gittith. [A Psalm] of Asaph.<BR>
<B>81,2</B> Sing aloud unto God our strength; shout unto the God of Jacob.<BR>
<B>81,3</B> Take up the melody, and sound the timbrel, the sweet harp with the psaltery.<BR>
<B>81,4</B> Blow the horn at the new moon, at the full moon for our feast-day.<BR>
<B>81,5</B> For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.<BR>
<B>81,6</B> He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when He went forth against the land of Egypt. <B>{N}</B><BR>The speech of one that I knew not did I hear:<BR>
<B>81,7</B> 'I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from the basket.<BR>
<B>81,8</B> Thou didst call in trouble, and I rescued thee; <B>{N}</B><BR>I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah<BR>
<B>81,9</B> Hear, O My people, and I will admonish thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto Me!<BR>
<B>81,10</B> There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any foreign god.<BR>
<B>81,11</B> I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt; <B>{N}</B><BR>open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.<BR>
<B>81,12</B> But My people hearkened not to My voice; and Israel would none of Me.<BR>
<B>81,13</B> So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, that they might walk in their own counsels.<BR>
<B>81,14</B> Oh that My people would hearken unto Me, that Israel would walk in My ways!<BR>
<B>81,15</B> I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn My hand against their adversaries.<BR>
<B>81,16</B> The haters of the LORD should dwindle away before Him; and their punishment should endure for ever.<BR>
<B>81,17</B> They should also be fed with the fat of wheat; and with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>82,1</B> A Psalm of Asaph. <B>{N}</B><BR>God standeth in the congregation of God; in the midst of the judges He judgeth:<BR>
<B>82,2</B> 'How long will ye judge unjustly, and respect the persons of the wicked? Selah<BR>
<B>82,3</B> Judge the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and destitute.<BR>
<B>82,4</B> Rescue the poor and needy; deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.<BR>
<B>82,5</B> They know not, neither do they understand; they go about in darkness; <B>{N}</B><BR>all the foundations of the earth are moved.<BR>
<B>82,6</B> I said: Ye are godlike beings, and all of you sons of the Most High.<BR>
<B>82,7</B> Nevertheless ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.'<BR>
<B>82,8</B> Arise, O God, judge the earth; for Thou shalt possess all the nations. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>83,1</B> A Song, a Psalm of Asaph.<BR>
<B>83,2</B> O God, keep not Thou silence; hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God.<BR>
<B>83,3</B> For, lo, Thine enemies are in an uproar; and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head.<BR>
<B>83,4</B> They hold crafty converse against Thy people, and take counsel against Thy treasured ones.<BR>
<B>83,5</B> They have said: 'Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.'<BR>
<B>83,6</B> For they have consulted together with one consent; against Thee do they make a covenant;<BR>
<B>83,7</B> The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;<BR>
<B>83,8</B> Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;<BR>
<B>83,9</B> Assyria also is joined with them; they have been an arm to the children of Lot. Selah<BR>
<B>83,10</B> Do Thou unto them as unto Midian; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon;<BR>
<B>83,11</B> Who were destroyed at En-dor; they became as dung for the earth.<BR>
<B>83,12</B> Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and like Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes;<BR>
<B>83,13</B> Who said: 'Let us take to ourselves in possession the habitations of God.'<BR>
<B>83,14</B> O my God, make them like the whirling dust; as stubble before the wind.<BR>
<B>83,15</B> As the fire that burneth the forest, and as the flame that setteth the mountains ablaze;<BR>
<B>83,16</B> So pursue them with Thy tempest, and affright them with Thy storm.<BR>
<B>83,17</B> Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek Thy name, O LORD.<BR>
<B>83,18</B> Let them be ashamed and affrighted for ever; yea, let them be abashed and perish;<BR>
<B>83,19</B> That they may know that it is Thou alone whose name is the LORD, <B>{N}</B><BR>the Most High over all the earth. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>84,1</B> For the Leader; upon the Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.<BR>
<B>84,2</B> How lovely are Thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!<BR>
<B>84,3</B> My soul yearneth, yea, even pineth for the courts of the LORD; <B>{N}</B><BR>my heart and my flesh sing for joy unto the living God.<BR>
<B>84,4</B> Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God--.<BR>
<B>84,5</B> Happy are they that dwell in Thy house, they are ever praising Thee. Selah<BR>
<B>84,6</B> Happy is the man whose strength is in Thee; in whose heart are the highways.<BR>
<B>84,7</B> Passing through the valley of Baca they make it a place of springs; <B>{N}</B><BR>yea, the early rain clotheth it with blessings.<BR>
<B>84,8</B> They go from strength to strength, every one of them appeareth before God in Zion.<BR>
<B>84,9</B> O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; <B>{N}</B><BR>give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah<BR>
<B>84,10</B> Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of Thine anointed.<BR>
<B>84,11</B> For a day in Thy courts is better than a thousand; <B>{N}</B><BR>I had rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.<BR>
<B>84,12</B> For the LORD God is a sun and a shield; <B>{N}</B><BR>the LORD giveth grace and glory; <B>{N}</B><BR>no good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly.<BR>
<B>84,13</B> O LORD of hosts, happy is the man that trusteth in Thee. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>85,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.<BR>
<B>85,2</B> LORD, Thou hast been favourable unto Thy land, Thou hast turned the captivity of Jacob.<BR>
<B>85,3</B> Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of Thy people, Thou hast pardoned all their sin. Selah<BR>
<B>85,4</B> Thou hast withdrawn all Thy wrath; Thou hast turned from the fierceness of Thine anger.<BR>
<B>85,5</B> Restore us, O God of our salvation, and cause Thine indignation toward us to cease.<BR>
<B>85,6</B> Wilt Thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt Thou draw out Thine anger to all generations?<BR>
<B>85,7</B> Wilt Thou not quicken us again, that Thy people may rejoice in Thee?<BR>
<B>85,8</B> Show us Thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us Thy salvation.<BR>
<B>85,9</B> I will hear what God the LORD will speak; <B>{N}</B><BR>for He will speak peace unto His people, and to His saints; but let them not turn back to folly.<BR>
<B>85,10</B> Surely His salvation is nigh them that fear Him; that glory may dwell in our land.<BR>
<B>85,11</B> Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.<BR>
<B>85,12</B> Truth springeth out of the earth; and righteousness hath looked down from heaven.<BR>
<B>85,13</B> Yea, the LORD will give that which is good; and our land shall yield her produce.<BR>
<B>85,14</B> Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall make His footsteps a way. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>86,1</B> A Prayer of David. <B>{N}</B><BR>Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and answer me; for I am poor and needy.<BR>
<B>86,2</B> Keep my soul, for I am godly; <B>{N}</B><BR>O Thou my God, save Thy servant that trusteth in Thee.<BR>
<B>86,3</B> Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for unto Thee do I cry all the day.<BR>
<B>86,4</B> Rejoice the soul of Thy servant; for unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.<BR>
<B>86,5</B> For Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to pardon, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon Thee.<BR>
<B>86,6</B> Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend unto the voice of my supplications.<BR>
<B>86,7</B> In the day of my trouble I call upon Thee; for Thou wilt answer me.<BR>
<B>86,8</B> There is none like unto Thee among the gods, O Lord, and there are no works like Thine.<BR>
<B>86,9</B> All nations whom Thou hast made shall come and prostrate themselves before Thee, O Lord; and they shall glorify Thy name.<BR>
<B>86,10</B> For Thou art great, and doest wondrous things; Thou art God alone.<BR>
<B>86,11</B> Teach me, O LORD, Thy way, that I may walk in Thy truth; <B>{N}</B><BR>make one my heart to fear Thy name.<BR>
<B>86,12</B> I will thank Thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart; and I will glorify Thy name for evermore.<BR>
<B>86,13</B> For great is Thy mercy toward me; and Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest nether-world.<BR>
<B>86,14</B> O God, the proud are risen up against me, and the company of violent men have sought after my soul, <B>{N}</B><BR>and have not set Thee before them.<BR>
<B>86,15</B> But Thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy and truth.<BR>
<B>86,16</B> O turn unto me, and be gracious unto me; give Thy strength unto Thy servant, and save the son of Thy handmaid.<BR>
<B>86,17</B> Work in my behalf a sign for good; <B>{N}</B><BR>that they that hate me may see it, and be put to shame, because Thou, LORD, hast helped me, and comforted me. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>87,1</B> A Psalm of the sons of Korah; a Song. His foundation is in the holy mountains.<BR>
<B>87,2</B> The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.<BR>
<B>87,3</B> Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah<BR>
<B>87,4</B> 'I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know Me; <B>{N}</B><BR>behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this one was born there.'<BR>
<B>87,5</B> But of Zion it shall be said: 'This man and that was born in her; <B>{N}</B><BR>and the Most High Himself doth establish her.'<BR>
<B>87,6</B> The LORD shall count in the register of the peoples: 'This one was born there.' Selah<BR>
<B>87,7</B> And whether they sing or dance, all my thoughts are in thee. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>88,1</B> A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; <B>{N}</B><BR>for the Leader; upon Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.<BR>
<B>88,2</B> O LORD, God of my salvation, what time I cry in the night before Thee,<BR>
<B>88,3</B> Let my prayer come before Thee, incline Thine ear unto my cry.<BR>
<B>88,4</B> For my soul is sated with troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.<BR>
<B>88,5</B> I am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am become as a man that hath no help;<BR>
<B>88,6</B> Set apart among the dead, <B>{N}</B><BR>like the slain that lie in the grave, whom Thou rememberest no more; <B>{N}</B><BR>and they are cut off from Thy hand.<BR>
<B>88,7</B> Thou hast laid me in the nethermost pit, in dark places, in the deeps.<BR>
<B>88,8</B> Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and all Thy waves Thou pressest down. Selah<BR>
<B>88,9</B> Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them; I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.<BR>
<B>88,10</B> Mine eye languisheth by reason of affliction; <B>{N}</B><BR>I have called upon Thee, O LORD, every day, I have spread forth my hands unto Thee.<BR>
<B>88,11</B> Wilt Thou work wonders for the dead? Or shall the shades arise and give Thee thanks? Selah<BR>
<B>88,12</B> Shall Thy mercy be declared in the grave? or Thy faithfulness in destruction?<BR>
<B>88,13</B> Shall Thy wonders be known in the dark? and Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?<BR>
<B>88,14</B> But as for me, unto Thee, O LORD, do I cry, and in the morning doth my prayer come to meet Thee.<BR>
<B>88,15</B> LORD, why castest Thou off my soul? Why hidest Thou Thy face from me?<BR>
<B>88,16</B> I am afflicted and at the point of death from my youth up; I have borne Thy terrors, I am distracted.<BR>
<B>88,17</B> Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy terrors have cut me off.<BR>
<B>88,18</B> They came round about me like water all the day; they compassed me about together.<BR>
<B>88,19</B> Friend and companion hast Thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>89,1</B> Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.<BR>
<B>89,2</B> I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever; to all generations will I make known Thy faithfulness with my mouth.<BR>
<B>89,3</B> For I have said: 'For ever is mercy built; in the very heavens Thou dost establish Thy faithfulness.<BR>
<B>89,4</B> I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn unto David My servant:<BR>
<B>89,5</B> For ever will I establish thy seed, and build up thy throne to all generations.' Selah<BR>
<B>89,6</B> So shall the heavens praise Thy wonders, O LORD, Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.<BR>
<B>89,7</B> For who in the skies can be compared unto the LORD, who among the sons of might can be likened unto the LORD,<BR>
<B>89,8</B> A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, and feared of all them that are about Him?<BR>
<B>89,9</B> O LORD God of hosts, who is a mighty one, like unto Thee, O LORD? And Thy faithfulness is round about Thee.<BR>
<B>89,10</B> Thou rulest the proud swelling of the sea; when the waves thereof arise, Thou stillest them.<BR>
<B>89,11</B> Thou didst crush Rahab, as one that is slain; Thou didst scatter Thine enemies with the arm of Thy strength.<BR>
<B>89,12</B> Thine are the heavens, Thine also the earth; the world and the fulness thereof, Thou hast founded them.<BR>
<B>89,13</B> The north and the south, Thou hast created them; Tabor and Hermon rejoice in Thy name.<BR>
<B>89,14</B> Thine is an arm with might; strong is Thy hand, and exalted is Thy right hand.<BR>
<B>89,15</B> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Thy throne; mercy and truth go before Thee.<BR>
<B>89,16</B> Happy is the people that know the joyful shout; they walk, O LORD, in the light of Thy countenance.<BR>
<B>89,17</B> In Thy name do they rejoice all the day; and through Thy righteousness are they exalted.<BR>
<B>89,18</B> For Thou art the glory of their strength; and in Thy favour our horn is exalted.<BR>
<B>89,19</B> For of the LORD is our shield; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.<BR>
<B>89,20</B> Then Thou spokest in vision to Thy godly ones, and saidst: 'I have laid help upon one that is mighty; <B>{N}</B><BR>I have exalted one chosen out of the people.<BR>
<B>89,21</B> I have found David My servant; with My holy oil have I anointed him;<BR>
<B>89,22</B> With whom My hand shall be established; Mine arm also shall strengthen him.<BR>
<B>89,23</B> The enemy shall not exact from him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.<BR>
<B>89,24</B> And I will beat to pieces his adversaries before him, and smite them that hate him.<BR>
<B>89,25</B> But My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him; and through My name shall his horn be exalted.<BR>
<B>89,26</B> I will set his hand also on the sea, and his right hand on the rivers.<BR>
<B>89,27</B> He shall call unto Me: Thou art my Father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.<BR>
<B>89,28</B> I also will appoint him first-born, the highest of the kings of the earth.<BR>
<B>89,29</B> For ever will I keep for him My mercy, and My covenant shall stand fast with him.<BR>
<B>89,30</B> His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.<BR>
<B>89,31</B> If his children forsake My law, and walk not in Mine ordinances;<BR>
<B>89,32</B> If they profane My statutes, and keep not My commandments;<BR>
<B>89,33</B> Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with strokes.<BR>
<B>89,34</B> But My mercy will I not break off from him, nor will I be false to My faithfulness.<BR>
<B>89,35</B> My covenant will I not profane, nor alter that which is gone out of My lips.<BR>
<B>89,36</B> Once have I sworn by My holiness: Surely I will not be false unto David;<BR>
<B>89,37</B> His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before Me.<BR>
<B>89,38</B> It shall be established for ever as the moon; and be stedfast as the witness in sky.' Selah<BR>
<B>89,39</B> But Thou hast cast off and rejected, Thou hast been wroth with Thine anointed.<BR>
<B>89,40</B> Thou hast abhorred the covenant of Thy servant; Thou hast profaned his crown even to the ground.<BR>
<B>89,41</B> Thou hast broken down all his fences; Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.<BR>
<B>89,42</B> All that pass by the way spoil him; he is become a taunt to his neighbours.<BR>
<B>89,43</B> Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries; Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.<BR>
<B>89,44</B> Yea, Thou turnest back the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.<BR>
<B>89,45</B> Thou hast made his brightness to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.<BR>
<B>89,46</B> The days of his youth hast Thou shortened; Thou hast covered him with shame. Selah<BR>
<B>89,47</B> How long, O LORD, wilt Thou hide Thyself for ever? How long shall Thy wrath burn like fire?<BR>
<B>89,48</B> O remember how short my time is; for what vanity hast Thou created all the children of men!<BR>
<B>89,49</B> What man is he that liveth and shall not see death, that shall deliver his soul from the power of the grave? Selah<BR>
<B>89,50</B> Where are Thy former mercies, O Lord, which Thou didst swear unto David in Thy faithfulness?<BR>
<B>89,51</B> Remember, Lord, the taunt of Thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom [the taunt of] so many peoples;<BR>
<B>89,52</B> Wherewith Thine enemies have taunted, O LORD, wherewith they have taunted the footsteps of Thine anointed.<BR>
<B>89,53</B> Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>90,1</B> A Prayer of Moses the man of God. <B>{N}</B><BR>Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations.<BR>
<B>90,2</B> Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever Thou hadst formed the earth and the world, <B>{N}</B><BR>even from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God.<BR>
<B>90,3</B> Thou turnest man to contrition; and sayest: 'Return, ye children of men.'<BR>
<B>90,4</B> For a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, <B>{N}</B><BR>and as a watch in the night.<BR>
<B>90,5</B> Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep; in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.<BR>
<B>90,6</B> In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.<BR>
<B>90,7</B> For we are consumed in Thine anger, and by Thy wrath are we hurried away.<BR>
<B>90,8</B> Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee, our secret sins in the light of Thy countenance.<BR>
<B>90,9</B> For all our days are passed away in Thy wrath; we bring our years to an end as a tale that is told.<BR>
<B>90,10</B> The days of our years are threescore years and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore years; <B>{N}</B><BR>yet is their pride but travail and vanity; <B>{N}</B><BR>for it is speedily gone, and we fly away.<BR>
<B>90,11</B> Who knoweth the power of Thine anger, and Thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto Thee?<BR>
<B>90,12</B> So teach us to number our days, that we may get us a heart of wisdom.<BR>
<B>90,13</B> Return, O LORD; how long? And let it repent Thee concerning Thy servants.<BR>
<B>90,14</B> O satisfy us in the morning with Thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.<BR>
<B>90,15</B> Make us glad according to the days wherein Thou hast afflicted us, according to the years wherein we have seen evil.<BR>
<B>90,16</B> Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants, and Thy glory upon their children.<BR>
<B>90,17</B> And let the graciousness of the Lord our God be upon us; <B>{N}</B><BR>establish Thou also upon us the work of our hands; yea, the work of our hands establish Thou it. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>91,1</B> O thou that dwellest in the covert of the Most High, and abidest in the shadow of the Almighty;<BR>
<B>91,2</B> I will say of the LORD, who is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust,<BR>
<B>91,3</B> That He will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.<BR>
<B>91,4</B> He will cover thee with His pinions, and under His wings shalt thou take refuge; His truth is a shield and a buckler.<BR>
<B>91,5</B> Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flieth by day;<BR>
<B>91,6</B> Of the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor of the destruction that wasteth at noonday.<BR>
<B>91,7</B> A thousand may fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; it shall not come nigh thee.<BR>
<B>91,8</B> Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the recompense of the wicked.<BR>
<B>91,9</B> For thou hast made the LORD who is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation.<BR>
<B>91,10</B> There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent.<BR>
<B>91,11</B> For He will give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.<BR>
<B>91,12</B> They shall bear thee upon their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.<BR>
<B>91,13</B> Thou shalt tread upon the lion and asp; the young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under feet.<BR>
<B>91,14</B> 'Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him on high, because he hath known My name.<BR>
<B>91,15</B> He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him, and bring him to honour.<BR>
<B>91,16</B> With long life will I satisfy him, and make him to behold My salvation.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>92,1</B> A Psalm, a Song. For the sabbath day.<BR>
<B>92,2</B> It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto Thy name, O Most High;<BR>
<B>92,3</B> To declare Thy lovingkindness in the morning, and Thy faithfulness in the night seasons,<BR>
<B>92,4</B> With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; with a solemn sound upon the harp.<BR>
<B>92,5</B> For Thou, LORD, hast made me glad through Thy work; I will exult in the works of Thy hands.<BR>
<B>92,6</B> How great are Thy works, O LORD! Thy thoughts are very deep.<BR>
<B>92,7</B> A brutish man knoweth not, neither doth a fool understand this.<BR>
<B>92,8</B> When the wicked spring up as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they may be destroyed for ever.<BR>
<B>92,9</B> But Thou, O LORD, art on high for evermore.<BR>
<B>92,10</B> For, lo, Thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, Thine enemies shall perish: <B>{N}</B><BR>all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.<BR>
<B>92,11</B> But my horn hast Thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox; I am anointed with rich oil.<BR>
<B>92,12</B> Mine eye also hath gazed on them that lie in wait for me, <B>{N}</B><BR>mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me.<BR>
<B>92,13</B> The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.<BR>
<B>92,14</B> Planted in the house of the LORD, they shall flourish in the courts of our God.<BR>
<B>92,15</B> They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and richness;<BR>
<B>92,16</B> To declare that the LORD is upright, my Rock, in whom there is no unrighteousness. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>93,1</B> The LORD reigneth; He is clothed in majesty; <B>{N}</B><BR>the LORD is clothed, He hath girded Himself with strength; yea, the world is established, that it cannot be moved.<BR>
<B>93,2</B> Thy throne is established of old; Thou art from everlasting.<BR>
<B>93,3</B> The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring.<BR>
<B>93,4</B> Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, the LORD on high is mighty.<BR>
<B>93,5</B> Thy testimonies are very sure, holiness becometh Thy house, O LORD, for evermore. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>94,1</B> O LORD, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.<BR>
<B>94,2</B> Lift up Thyself, Thou Judge of the earth; render to the proud their recompense.<BR>
<B>94,3</B> LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult?<BR>
<B>94,4</B> They gush out, they speak arrogancy; all the workers of iniquity bear themselves loftily.<BR>
<B>94,5</B> They crush Thy people, O LORD, and afflict Thy heritage.<BR>
<B>94,6</B> They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.<BR>
<B>94,7</B> And they say: 'The LORD will not see, neither will the God of Jacob give heed.'<BR>
<B>94,8</B> Consider, ye brutish among the people; and ye fools, when will ye understand?<BR>
<B>94,9</B> He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed the eye, shall He not see?<BR>
<B>94,10</B> He that instructeth nations, shall not He correct? even He that teacheth man knowledge?<BR>
<B>94,11</B> The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.<BR>
<B>94,12</B> Happy is the man whom Thou instructest, O LORD, and teachest out of Thy law;<BR>
<B>94,13</B> That Thou mayest give him rest from the days of evil, until the pit be digged for the wicked.<BR>
<B>94,14</B> For the LORD will not cast off His people, neither will He forsake His inheritance.<BR>
<B>94,15</B> For right shall return unto justice, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.<BR>
<B>94,16</B> Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?<BR>
<B>94,17</B> Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had soon dwelt in silence.<BR>
<B>94,18</B> If I say: 'My foot slippeth', Thy mercy, O LORD, holdeth me up.<BR>
<B>94,19</B> When my cares are many within me, Thy comforts delight my soul.<BR>
<B>94,20</B> Shall the seat of wickedness have fellowship with Thee, which frameth mischief by statute?<BR>
<B>94,21</B> They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn innocent blood.<BR>
<B>94,22</B> But the LORD hath been my high tower, and my God the rock of my refuge.<BR>
<B>94,23</B> And He hath brought upon them their own iniquity, and will cut them off in their own evil; <B>{N}</B><BR>the LORD our God will cut them off. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>95,1</B> O come, let us sing unto the LORD; let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.<BR>
<B>95,2</B> Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, let us shout for joy unto Him with psalms.<BR>
<B>95,3</B> For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods;<BR>
<B>95,4</B> In whose hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are His also.<BR>
<B>95,5</B> The sea is His, and He made it; and His hands formed the dry land.<BR>
<B>95,6</B> O come, let us bow down and bend the knee; let us kneel before the LORD our Maker;<BR>
<B>95,7</B> For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the flock of His hand. <B>{N}</B><BR>To-day, if ye would but hearken to His voice!<BR>
<B>95,8</B> 'Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness;<BR>
<B>95,9</B> When your fathers tried Me, proved Me, even though they saw My work.<BR>
<B>95,10</B> For forty years was I wearied with that generation, and said: It is a people that do err in their heart, <B>{N}</B><BR>and they have not known My ways;<BR>
<B>95,11</B> Wherefore I swore in My wrath, that they should not enter into My rest.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>96,1</B> O sing unto the LORD a new song; sing unto the LORD, all the earth.<BR>
<B>96,2</B> Sing unto the LORD, bless His name; proclaim His salvation from day to day.<BR>
<B>96,3</B> Declare His glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples.<BR>
<B>96,4</B> For great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.<BR>
<B>96,5</B> For all the gods of the peoples are things of nought; but the LORD made the heavens.<BR>
<B>96,6</B> Honour and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.<BR>
<B>96,7</B> Ascribe unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the peoples, ascribe unto the LORD glory and strength.<BR>
<B>96,8</B> Ascribe unto the LORD the glory due unto His name; bring an offering, and come into His courts.<BR>
<B>96,9</B> O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; tremble before Him, all the earth.<BR>
<B>96,10</B> Say among the nations: 'The LORD reigneth.' The world also is established that it cannot be moved; <B>{N}</B><BR>He will judge the peoples with equity.<BR>
<B>96,11</B> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;<BR>
<B>96,12</B> Let the field exult; and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy;<BR>
<B>96,13</B> Before the LORD, for He is come; for He is come to judge the earth; <B>{N}</B><BR>He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples in His faithfulness. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>97,1</B> The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad.<BR>
<B>97,2</B> Clouds and darkness are round about Him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.<BR>
<B>97,3</B> A fire goeth before Him, and burneth up His adversaries round about.<BR>
<B>97,4</B> His lightnings lighted up the world; the earth saw, and trembled.<BR>
<B>97,5</B> The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.<BR>
<B>97,6</B> The heavens declared His righteousness, and all the peoples saw His glory.<BR>
<B>97,7</B> Ashamed be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of things of nought; <B>{N}</B><BR>bow down to Him, all ye gods.<BR>
<B>97,8</B> Zion heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced; <B>{N}</B><BR>because of Thy judgments, O LORD.<BR>
<B>97,9</B> For Thou, LORD, art most high above all the earth; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou art exalted far above all gods.<BR>
<B>97,10</B> O ye that love the LORD, hate evil; <B>{N}</B><BR>He preserveth the souls of His saints; He delivered them out of the hand of the wicked.<BR>
<B>97,11</B> Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.<BR>
<B>97,12</B> Be glad in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks to His holy name. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>98,1</B> A Psalm. O sing unto the LORD a new song; for He hath done marvellous things; <B>{N}</B><BR>His right hand, and His holy arm, hath wrought salvation for Him.<BR>
<B>98,2</B> The LORD hath made known His salvation; His righteousness hath He revealed in the sight of the nations.<BR>
<B>98,3</B> He hath remembered His mercy and His faithfulness toward the house of Israel; <B>{N}</B><BR>all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.<BR>
<B>98,4</B> Shout unto the LORD, all the earth; break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.<BR>
<B>98,5</B> Sing praises unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp and the voice of melody.<BR>
<B>98,6</B> With trumpets and sound of the horn shout ye before the King, the LORD.<BR>
<B>98,7</B> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein;<BR>
<B>98,8</B> Let the floods clap their hands; let the mountains sing for joy together;<BR>
<B>98,9</B> Before the LORD, for He is come to judge the earth; <B>{N}</B><BR>He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>99,1</B> The LORD reigneth; let the peoples tremble; He is enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake.<BR>
<B>99,2</B> The LORD is great in Zion; and He is high above all the peoples.<BR>
<B>99,3</B> Let them praise Thy name as great and awful; Holy is He.<BR>
<B>99,4</B> The strength also of the king who loveth justice-- <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou hast established equity, Thou hast executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.<BR>
<B>99,5</B> Exalt ye the LORD our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool; Holy is He.<BR>
<B>99,6</B> Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name, <B>{N}</B><BR>did call upon the LORD, and He answered them.<BR>
<B>99,7</B> He spoke unto them in the pillar of cloud; they kept His testimonies, and the statute that He gave them.<BR>
<B>99,8</B> O LORD our God, Thou didst answer them; <B>{N}</B><BR>a forgiving God wast Thou unto them, though Thou tookest vengeance of their misdeeds.<BR>
<B>99,9</B> Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at His holy hill; <B>{N}</B><BR>for the LORD our God is holy. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>100,1</B> A Psalm of thanksgiving. Shout unto the LORD, all the earth.<BR>
<B>100,2</B> Serve the LORD with gladness; come before His presence with singing.<BR>
<B>100,3</B> Know ye that the LORD He is God; <B>{N}</B><BR>it is He that hath made us, and we are His, His people, and the flock of His pasture.<BR>
<B>100,4</B> Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise; give thanks unto Him, and bless His name.<BR>
<B>100,5</B> For the LORD is good; His mercy endureth for ever; and His faithfulness unto all generations. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>101,1</B> A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and justice; unto Thee, O LORD, will I sing praises.<BR>
<B>101,2</B> I will give heed unto the way of integrity; oh when wilt Thou come unto me? <B>{N}</B><BR>I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart.<BR>
<B>101,3</B> I will set no base thing before mine eyes; <B>{N}</B><BR>I hate the doing of things crooked; it shall not cleave unto me.<BR>
<B>101,4</B> A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know no evil thing.<BR>
<B>101,5</B> Whoso slandereth his neighbour in secret, him will I destroy; <B>{N}</B><BR>whoso is haughty of eye and proud of heart, him will I not suffer.<BR>
<B>101,6</B> Mine eyes are upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; <B>{N}</B><BR>he that walketh in a way of integrity, he shall minister unto me.<BR>
<B>101,7</B> He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house; <B>{N}</B><BR>he that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.<BR>
<B>101,8</B> Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; <B>{N}</B><BR>to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>102,1</B> A Prayer of the afflicted, when he fainteth, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD.<BR>
<B>102,2</B> O LORD, hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto Thee.<BR>
<B>102,3</B> Hide not Thy face from me in the day of my distress; <B>{N}</B><BR>incline Thine ear unto me; in the day when I call answer me speedily.<BR>
<B>102,4</B> For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as a hearth.<BR>
<B>102,5</B> My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; for I forget to eat my bread.<BR>
<B>102,6</B> By reason of the voice of my sighing my bones cleave to my flesh.<BR>
<B>102,7</B> I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places.<BR>
<B>102,8</B> I watch, and am become like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop.<BR>
<B>102,9</B> Mine enemies taunt me all the day; they that are mad against me do curse by me.<BR>
<B>102,10</B> For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,<BR>
<B>102,11</B> Because of Thine indignation and Thy wrath; for Thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.<BR>
<B>102,12</B> My days are like a lengthening shadow; and I am withered like grass.<BR>
<B>102,13</B> But Thou, O LORD, sittest enthroned for ever; and Thy name is unto all generations.<BR>
<B>102,14</B> Thou wilt arise, and have compassion upon Zion; for it is time to be gracious unto her, for the appointed time is come.<BR>
<B>102,15</B> For Thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and love her dust.<BR>
<B>102,16</B> So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth Thy glory;<BR>
<B>102,17</B> When the LORD hath built up Zion, when He hath appeared in His glory;<BR>
<B>102,18</B> When He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, and hath not despised their prayer.<BR>
<B>102,19</B> This shall be written for the generation to come; and a people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.<BR>
<B>102,20</B> For He hath looked down from the height of His sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;<BR>
<B>102,21</B> To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;<BR>
<B>102,22</B> That men may tell of the name of the LORD in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem;<BR>
<B>102,23</B> When the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.<BR>
<B>102,24</B> He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.<BR>
<B>102,25</B> I say: 'O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days, Thou whose years endure throughout all generations.<BR>
<B>102,26</B> Of old Thou didst lay the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of Thy hands.<BR>
<B>102,27</B> They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure; <B>{N}</B><BR>yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall pass away;<BR>
<B>102,28</B> But Thou art the selfsame, and Thy years shall have no end.<BR>
<B>102,29</B> The children of Thy servants shall dwell securely, and their seed shall be established before Thee.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>103,1</B> [A Psalm] of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name.<BR>
<B>103,2</B> Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits;<BR>
<B>103,3</B> Who forgiveth all thine iniquity; who healeth all thy diseases;<BR>
<B>103,4</B> Who redeemeth thy life from the pit; who encompasseth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;<BR>
<B>103,5</B> Who satisfieth thine old age with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle.<BR>
<B>103,6</B> The LORD executeth righteousness, and acts of justice for all that are oppressed.<BR>
<B>103,7</B> He made known His ways unto Moses, His doings unto the children of Israel.<BR>
<B>103,8</B> The LORD is full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.<BR>
<B>103,9</B> He will not always contend; neither will He keep His anger for ever.<BR>
<B>103,10</B> He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor requited us according to our iniquities.<BR>
<B>103,11</B> For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward them that fear Him.<BR>
<B>103,12</B> As far as the east is from the west, so far hath He removed our transgressions from us.<BR>
<B>103,13</B> Like as a father hath compassion upon his children, so hath the LORD compassion upon them that fear Him.<BR>
<B>103,14</B> For He knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust.<BR>
<B>103,15</B> As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.<BR>
<B>103,16</B> For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof knoweth it no more.<BR>
<B>103,17</B> But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him, <B>{N}</B><BR>and His righteousness unto children's children;<BR>
<B>103,18</B> To such as keep His covenant, and to those that remember His precepts to do them.<BR>
<B>103,19</B> The LORD hath established His throne in the heavens; and His kingdom ruleth over all.<BR>
<B>103,20</B> Bless the LORD, ye angels of His, <B>{N}</B><BR>ye mighty in strength, that fulfil His word, hearkening unto the voice of His word.<BR>
<B>103,21</B> Bless the LORD, all ye His hosts; ye ministers of His, that do His pleasure.<BR>
<B>103,22</B> Bless the LORD, all ye His works, in all places of His dominion; <B>{N}</B><BR>bless the LORD, O my soul. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>104,1</B> Bless the LORD, O my soul. <B>{N}</B><BR>O LORD my God, Thou art very great; Thou art clothed with glory and majesty.<BR>
<B>104,2</B> Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment, who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;<BR>
<B>104,3</B> Who layest the beams of Thine upper chambers in the waters, <B>{N}</B><BR>who makest the clouds Thy chariot, who walkest upon the wings of the wind;<BR>
<B>104,4</B> Who makest winds Thy messengers, the flaming fire Thy ministers.<BR>
<B>104,5</B> Who didst establish the earth upon its foundations, that it should not be moved for ever and ever;<BR>
<B>104,6</B> Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a vesture; the waters stood above the mountains.<BR>
<B>104,7</B> At Thy rebuke they fled, at the voice of Thy thunder they hasted away--<BR>
<B>104,8</B> The mountains rose, the valleys sank down--unto the place which Thou hadst founded for them;<BR>
<B>104,9</B> Thou didst set a bound which they should not pass over, that they might not return to cover the earth.<BR>
<B>104,10</B> Who sendest forth springs into the valleys; they run between the mountains;<BR>
<B>104,11</B> They give drink to every beast of the field, the wild asses quench their thirst.<BR>
<B>104,12</B> Beside them dwell the fowl of the heaven, from among the branches they sing.<BR>
<B>104,13</B> Who waterest the mountains from Thine upper chambers; the earth is full of the fruit of Thy works.<BR>
<B>104,14</B> Who causeth the grass to spring up for the cattle, and herb for the service of man; <B>{N}</B><BR>to bring forth bread out of the earth,<BR>
<B>104,15</B> And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, making the face brighter than oil, <B>{N}</B><BR>and bread that stayeth man's heart.<BR>
<B>104,16</B> The trees of the LORD have their fill, the cedars of Lebanon, which He hath planted;<BR>
<B>104,17</B> Wherein the birds make their nests; as for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.<BR>
<B>104,18</B> The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the conies.<BR>
<B>104,19</B> Who appointedst the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down.<BR>
<B>104,20</B> Thou makest darkness, and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.<BR>
<B>104,21</B> The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from God.<BR>
<B>104,22</B> The sun ariseth, they slink away, and couch in their dens.<BR>
<B>104,23</B> Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.<BR>
<B>104,24</B> How manifold are Thy works, O LORD! In wisdom hast Thou made them all; <B>{N}</B><BR>the earth is full of Thy creatures.<BR>
<B>104,25</B> Yonder sea, great and wide, <B>{N}</B><BR>therein are creeping things innumerable, living creatures, both small and great.<BR>
<B>104,26</B> There go the ships; there is leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to sport therein.<BR>
<B>104,27</B> All of them wait for Thee, that Thou mayest give them their food in due season.<BR>
<B>104,28</B> Thou givest it unto them, they gather it; Thou openest Thy hand, they are satisfied with good.<BR>
<B>104,29</B> Thou hidest Thy face, they vanish; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou withdrawest their breath, they perish, and return to their dust.<BR>
<B>104,30</B> Thou sendest forth Thy spirit, they are created; and Thou renewest the face of the earth.<BR>
<B>104,31</B> May the glory of the LORD endure for ever; let the LORD rejoice in His works!<BR>
<B>104,32</B> Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.<BR>
<B>104,33</B> I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.<BR>
<B>104,34</B> Let my musing be sweet unto Him; as for me, I will rejoice in the LORD.<BR>
<B>104,35</B> Let sinners cease out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. <B>{N}</B><BR>Bless the LORD, O my soul. <B>{N}</B><BR>Hallelujah.<BR>
<B>105,1</B> O give thanks unto the LORD, call upon His name; make known His doings among the peoples.<BR>
<B>105,2</B> Sing unto Him, sing praises unto Him; speak ye of all His marvellous works.<BR>
<B>105,3</B> Glory ye in His holy name; let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.<BR>
<B>105,4</B> Seek ye the LORD and His strength; seek His face continually.<BR>
<B>105,5</B> Remember His marvellous works that He hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth;<BR>
<B>105,6</B> O ye seed of Abraham His servant, ye children of Jacob, His chosen ones.<BR>
<B>105,7</B> He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth.<BR>
<B>105,8</B> He hath remembered His covenant for ever, the word which He commanded to a thousand generations;<BR>
<B>105,9</B> [The covenant] which He made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac;<BR>
<B>105,10</B> And He established it unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant;<BR>
<B>105,11</B> Saying: 'Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance.'<BR>
<B>105,12</B> When they were but a few men in number. Yea, very few, and sojourners in it,<BR>
<B>105,13</B> And when they went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,<BR>
<B>105,14</B> He suffered no man to do them wrong, yea, for their sake He reproved kings:<BR>
<B>105,15</B> 'Touch not Mine anointed ones, and do My prophets no harm.'<BR>
<B>105,16</B> And He called a famine upon the land; He broke the whole staff of bread.<BR>
<B>105,17</B> He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant;<BR>
<B>105,18</B> His feet they hurt with fetters, his person was laid in iron;<BR>
<B>105,19</B> Until the time that his word came to pass, the word of the LORD tested him.<BR>
<B>105,20</B> The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the peoples, and set him free.<BR>
<B>105,21</B> He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possessions;<BR>
<B>105,22</B> To bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his elders wisdom.<BR>
<B>105,23</B> Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.<BR>
<B>105,24</B> And He increased His people greatly, and made them too mighty for their adversaries.<BR>
<B>105,25</B> He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal craftily with His servants.<BR>
<B>105,26</B> He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron whom He had chosen.<BR>
<B>105,27</B> They wrought among them His manifold signs, and wonders in the land of Ham.<BR>
<B>105,28</B> He sent darkness, and it was dark; and they rebelled not against His word.<BR>
<B>105,29</B> He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.<BR>
<B>105,30</B> Their land swarmed with frogs, in the chambers of their kings.<BR>
<B>105,31</B> He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats in all their borders.<BR>
<B>105,32</B> He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.<BR>
<B>105,33</B> He smote their vines also and their fig-trees; and broke the trees of their borders.<BR>
<B>105,34</B> He spoke, and the locust came, and the canker-worm without number,<BR>
<B>105,35</B> And did eat up every herb in their land, and did eat up the fruit of their ground.<BR>
<B>105,36</B> He smote also all the first-born in their land, the first-fruits of all their strength.<BR>
<B>105,37</B> And He brought them forth with silver and gold; and there was none that stumbled among His tribes.<BR>
<B>105,38</B> Egypt was glad when they departed; for the fear of them had fallen upon them.<BR>
<B>105,39</B> He spread a cloud for a screen; and fire to give light in the night.<BR>
<B>105,40</B> They asked, and He brought quails, and gave them in plenty the bread of heaven.<BR>
<B>105,41</B> He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; they ran, a river in the dry places.<BR>
<B>105,42</B> For He remembered His holy word unto Abraham His servant;<BR>
<B>105,43</B> And He brought forth His people with joy, His chosen ones with singing.<BR>
<B>105,44</B> And He gave them the lands of the nations, and they took the labour of the peoples in possession;<BR>
<B>105,45</B> That they might keep His statutes, and observe His laws. <B>{N}</B><BR>Hallelujah.<BR>
<B>106,1</B> Hallelujah. <B>{N}</B><BR>O give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good; for His mercy endureth for ever.<BR>
<B>106,2</B> Who can express the mighty acts of the LORD, or make all His praise to be heard?<BR>
<B>106,3</B> Happy are they that keep justice, that do righteousness at all times.<BR>
<B>106,4</B> Remember me, O LORD, when Thou favourest Thy people; O think of me at Thy salvation;<BR>
<B>106,5</B> That I may behold the prosperity of Thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Thy nation, <B>{N}</B><BR>that I may glory with Thine inheritance.<BR>
<B>106,6</B> We have sinned with our fathers, we have done iniquitously, we have dealt wickedly.<BR>
<B>106,7</B> Our fathers in Egypt gave no heed unto Thy wonders; <B>{N}</B><BR>they remembered not the multitude of Thy mercies; <B>{N}</B><BR>but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.<BR>
<B>106,8</B> Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake, that He might make His mighty power to be known.<BR>
<B>106,9</B> And He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; and He led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.<BR>
<B>106,10</B> And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.<BR>
<B>106,11</B> And the waters covered their adversaries; there was not one of them left.<BR>
<B>106,12</B> Then believed they His words; they sang His praise.<BR>
<B>106,13</B> They soon forgot His works; they waited not for His counsel;<BR>
<B>106,14</B> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tried God in the desert.<BR>
<B>106,15</B> And He gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.<BR>
<B>106,16</B> They were jealous also of Moses in the camp, and of Aaron the holy one of the LORD.<BR>
<B>106,17</B> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.<BR>
<B>106,18</B> And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.<BR>
<B>106,19</B> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped a molten image.<BR>
<B>106,20</B> Thus they exchanged their glory for the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.<BR>
<B>106,21</B> They forgot God their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt;<BR>
<B>106,22</B> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, terrible things by the Red Sea.<BR>
<B>106,23</B> Therefore He said that He would destroy them, <B>{N}</B><BR>had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach, <B>{N}</B><BR>to turn back His wrath, lest He should destroy them.<BR>
<B>106,24</B> Moreover, they scorned the desirable land, they believed not His word;<BR>
<B>106,25</B> And they murmured in their tents, they hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.<BR>
<B>106,26</B> Therefore He swore concerning them, that He would overthrow them in the wilderness;<BR>
<B>106,27</B> And that He would cast out their seed among the nations, and scatter them in the lands.<BR>
<B>106,28</B> They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.<BR>
<B>106,29</B> Thus they provoked Him with their doings, and the plague broke in upon them.<BR>
<B>106,30</B> Then stood up Phinehas, and wrought judgment, and so the plague was stayed.<BR>
<B>106,31</B> And that was counted unto him for righteousness, unto all generations for ever.<BR>
<B>106,32</B> They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses because of them;<BR>
<B>106,33</B> For they embittered his spirit, and he spoke rashly with his lips.<BR>
<B>106,34</B> They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them;<BR>
<B>106,35</B> But mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works;<BR>
<B>106,36</B> And they served their idols, which became a snare unto them;<BR>
<B>106,37</B> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,<BR>
<B>106,38</B> And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; <B>{N}</B><BR>and the land was polluted with blood.<BR>
<B>106,39</B> Thus were they defiled with their works, and went astray in their doings.<BR>
<B>106,40</B> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against His people, and He abhorred His inheritance.<BR>
<B>106,41</B> And He gave them into the hand of the nations; and they that hated them ruled over them.<BR>
<B>106,42</B> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were subdued under their hand.<BR>
<B>106,43</B> Many times did He deliver them; <B>{N}</B><BR>but they were rebellious in their counsel, and sank low through their iniquity.<BR>
<B>106,44</B> Nevertheless He looked upon their distress, when He heard their cry;<BR>
<B>106,45</B> And He remembered for them His covenant, and repented according to the multitude of His mercies.<BR>
<B>106,46</B> He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captive.<BR>
<B>106,47</B> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, <B>{N}</B><BR>that we may give thanks unto Thy holy name, that we may triumph in Thy praise.<BR>
<B>106,48</B> Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting, <B>{N}</B><BR>and let all the people say: 'Amen.' <B>{N}</B><BR>Hallelujah. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>107,1</B> 'O give thanks unto the LORD, for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever.'<BR>
<B>107,2</B> So let the redeemed of the LORD say, whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary;<BR>
<B>107,3</B> And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the sea.<BR>
<B>107,4</B> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; they found no city of habitation.<BR>
<B>107,5</B> Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.<BR>
<B>107,6</B> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses.<BR>
<B>107,7</B> And He led them by a straight way, that they might go to a city of habitation.<BR>
<B>107,8</B> Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy, and for His wonderful works to the children of men!<BR>
<B>107,9</B> For He hath satisfied the longing soul, and the hungry soul He hath filled with good.<BR>
<B>107,10</B> Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron--<BR>
<B>107,11</B> Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the Most High.<BR>
<B>107,12</B> Therefore He humbled their heart with travail, they stumbled, and there was none to help--<BR>
<B>107,13</B> They cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them out of their distresses.<BR>
<B>107,14</B> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bands in sunder.<BR>
<B>107,15</B> Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy, and for His wonderful works to the children of men!<BR>
<B>107,16</B> For He hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.<BR>
<B>107,17</B> Crazed because of the way of their transgression, and afflicted because of their iniquities--<BR>
<B>107,18</B> Their soul abhorred all manner of food, and they drew near unto the gates of death--<BR>
<B>107,19</B> They cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and He saved them out of their distresses;<BR>
<B>107,20</B> He sent His word, and healed them, and delivered them from their graves.<BR>
<B>107,21</B> Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy, and for His wonderful works to the children of men!<BR>
<B>107,22</B> And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare His works with singing.<BR>
<B>107,23</B> They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters--<BR>
<B>107,24</B> These saw the works of the LORD, and His wonders in the deep;<BR>
<B>107,25</B> For He commanded, and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves thereof;<BR>
<B>107,26</B> They mounted up to the heaven, they went down to the deeps; their soul melted away because of trouble;<BR>
<B>107,27</B> They reeled to and fro, and staggered like a drunken man, and all their wisdom was swallowed up--<BR>
<B>107,28</B> They cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and He brought them out of their distresses.<BR>
<B>107,29</B> He made the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof were still.<BR>
<B>107,30</B> Then were they glad because they were quiet, and He led them unto their desired haven.<BR>
<B>107,31</B> Let them give thanks unto the LORD for His mercy, and for His wonderful works to the children of men!<BR>
<B>107,32</B> Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people, and praise Him in the seat of the elders.<BR>
<B>107,33</B> He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and watersprings into a thirsty ground;<BR>
<B>107,34</B> A fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.<BR>
<B>107,35</B> He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, and a dry land into watersprings.<BR>
<B>107,36</B> And there He maketh the hungry to dwell, and they establish a city of habitation;<BR>
<B>107,37</B> And sow fields, and plant vineyards, which yield fruits of increase.<BR>
<B>107,38</B> He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly, and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.<BR>
<B>107,39</B> Again, they are minished and dwindle away through oppression of evil and sorrow.<BR>
<B>107,40</B> He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.<BR>
<B>107,41</B> Yet setteth He the needy on high from affliction, and maketh his families like a flock.<BR>
<B>107,42</B> The upright see it, and are glad; and all iniquity stoppeth her mouth.<BR>
<B>107,43</B> Whoso is wise, let him observe these things, and let them consider the mercies of the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>108,1</B> A Song, a Psalm of David. <B>108,2</B> My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.<BR>
<B>108,3</B> Awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake the dawn.<BR>
<B>108,4</B> I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD, among the peoples; and I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations.<BR>
<B>108,5</B> For Thy mercy is great above the heavens, and Thy truth reacheth unto the skies.<BR>
<B>108,6</B> Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and Thy glory be above all the earth.<BR>
<B>108,7</B> That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand, and answer me.<BR>
<B>108,8</B> God spoke in His holiness, that I would exult; that I would divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.<BR>
<B>108,9</B> Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.<BR>
<B>108,10</B> Moab is my washpot; upon Edom do I cast my shoe; over Philistia do I cry aloud.<BR>
<B>108,11</B> Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me unto Edom?<BR>
<B>108,12</B> Hast not Thou cast us off, O God? and Thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts?<BR>
<B>108,13</B> Give us help against the adversary; for vain is the help of man.<BR>
<B>108,14</B> Through God we shall do valiantly; for He it is that will tread down our adversaries. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>109,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of David. <B>{N}</B><BR>O God of my praise, keep not silence;<BR>
<B>109,2</B> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me; they have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.<BR>
<B>109,3</B> They compassed me about also with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.<BR>
<B>109,4</B> In return for my love they are my adversaries; but I am all prayer.<BR>
<B>109,5</B> And they have laid upon me evil for good, and hatred for my love:<BR>
<B>109,6</B> 'Set Thou a wicked man over him; and let an adversary stand at his right hand.<BR>
<B>109,7</B> When he is judged, let him go forth condemned; and let his prayer be turned into sin.<BR>
<B>109,8</B> Let his days be few; let another take his charge.<BR>
<B>109,9</B> Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.<BR>
<B>109,10</B> Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; and let them seek their bread out of their desolate places.<BR>
<B>109,11</B> Let the creditor distrain all that he hath; and let strangers make spoil of his labour.<BR>
<B>109,12</B> Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; neither let there be any to be gracious unto his fatherless children.<BR>
<B>109,13</B> Let his posterity be cut off; in the generation following let their name be blotted out.<BR>
<B>109,14</B> Let the iniquity of his fathers be brought to remembrance unto the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.<BR>
<B>109,15</B> Let them be before the LORD continually, that He may cut off the memory of them from the earth.<BR>
<B>109,16</B> Because that he remembered not to do kindness, <B>{N}</B><BR>but persecuted the poor and needy man, and the broken in heart he was ready to slay.<BR>
<B>109,17</B> Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; and he delighted not in blessing, and it is far from him.<BR>
<B>109,18</B> He clothed himself also with cursing as with his raiment, and it is come into his inward parts like water, and like oil into his bones.<BR>
<B>109,19</B> Let it be unto him as the garment which he putteth on, and for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.'<BR>
<B>109,20</B> This would mine adversaries effect from the LORD, and they that speak evil against my soul.<BR>
<B>109,21</B> But Thou, O GOD the Lord, deal with me for Thy name's sake; <B>{N}</B><BR>because Thy mercy is good, deliver Thou me.<BR>
<B>109,22</B> For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.<BR>
<B>109,23</B> I am gone like the shadow when it lengtheneth; I am shaken off as the locust.<BR>
<B>109,24</B> My knees totter through fasting; and my flesh is lean, and hath no fatness.<BR>
<B>109,25</B> I am become also a taunt unto them; when they see me, they shake their head.<BR>
<B>109,26</B> Help me, O LORD my God; O save me according to Thy mercy;<BR>
<B>109,27</B> That they may know that this is Thy hand; that Thou, LORD, hast done it.<BR>
<B>109,28</B> Let them curse, but bless Thou; when they arise, they shall be put to shame, but Thy servant shall rejoice.<BR>
<B>109,29</B> Mine adversaries shall be clothed with confusion, and shall put on their own shame as a robe.<BR>
<B>109,30</B> I will give great thanks unto the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise Him among the multitude;<BR>
<B>109,31</B> Because He standeth at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that judge his soul. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>110,1</B> A Psalm of David. <B>{N}</B><BR>The LORD saith unto my lord: 'Sit thou at My right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.'<BR>
<B>110,2</B> The rod of Thy strength the LORD will send out of Zion: 'Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.'<BR>
<B>110,3</B> Thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of thy warfare; <B>{N}</B><BR>in adornments of holiness, from the womb of the dawn, thine is the dew of thy youth.<BR>
<B>110,4</B> The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent: 'Thou art a priest for ever <B>{N}</B><BR>after the manner of Melchizedek.'<BR>
<B>110,5</B> The Lord at thy right hand doth crush kings in the day of His wrath.<BR>
<B>110,6</B> He will judge among the nations; He filleth it with dead bodies, He crusheth the head over a wide land.<BR>
<B>110,7</B> He will drink of the brook in the way; therefore will he lift up the head. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>111,1</B> Hallelujah. <B>{N}</B><BR>I will give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the congregation.<BR>
<B>111,2</B> The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have delight therein.<BR>
<B>111,3</B> His work is glory and majesty; and His righteousness endureth for ever.<BR>
<B>111,4</B> He hath made a memorial for His wonderful works; the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.<BR>
<B>111,5</B> He hath given food unto them that fear Him; He will ever be mindful of His covenant.<BR>
<B>111,6</B> He hath declared to His people the power of His works, in giving them the heritage of the nations.<BR>
<B>111,7</B> The works of His hands are truth and justice; all His precepts are sure.<BR>
<B>111,8</B> They are established for ever and ever, they are done in truth and uprightness.<BR>
<B>111,9</B> He hath sent redemption unto His people; He hath commanded His covenant for ever; <B>{N}</B><BR>Holy and awful is His name.<BR>
<B>111,10</B> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do thereafter; <B>{N}</B><BR>His praise endureth for ever. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>112,1</B> Hallelujah. <B>{N}</B><BR>Happy is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in His commandments.<BR>
<B>112,2</B> His seed shall be mighty upon earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed.<BR>
<B>112,3</B> Wealth and riches are in his house; and his merit endureth for ever.<BR>
<B>112,4</B> Unto the upright He shineth as a light in the darkness, gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.<BR>
<B>112,5</B> Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth, that ordereth his affairs rightfully.<BR>
<B>112,6</B> For he shall never be moved; the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.<BR>
<B>112,7</B> He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is stedfast, trusting in the LORD.<BR>
<B>112,8</B> His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he gaze upon his adversaries.<BR>
<B>112,9</B> He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the needy; his righteousness endureth for ever; <B>{N}</B><BR>his horn shall be exalted in honour.<BR>
<B>112,10</B> The wicked shall see it, and be vexed; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away; <B>{N}</B><BR>the desire of the wicked shall perish. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>113,1</B> Hallelujah. <B>{N}</B><BR>Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.<BR>
<B>113,2</B> Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for ever.<BR>
<B>113,3</B> From the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof the LORD'S name is to be praised.<BR>
<B>113,4</B> The LORD is high above all nations, His glory is above the heavens.<BR>
<B>113,5</B> Who is like unto the LORD our God, that is enthroned on high,<BR>
<B>113,6</B> That looketh down low upon heaven and upon the earth?<BR>
<B>113,7</B> Who raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the needy out of the dunghill;<BR>
<B>113,8</B> That He may set him with princes, even with the princes of His people.<BR>
<B>113,9</B> Who maketh the barren woman to dwell in her house as a joyful mother of children. <B>{N}</B><BR>Hallelujah.<BR>
<B>114,1</B> When Israel came forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;<BR>
<B>114,2</B> Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominion.<BR>
<B>114,3</B> The sea saw it, and fled; the Jordan turned backward.<BR>
<B>114,4</B> The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like young sheep.<BR>
<B>114,5</B> What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? thou Jordan, that thou turnest backward?<BR>
<B>114,6</B> Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; ye hills, like young sheep?<BR>
<B>114,7</B> Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;<BR>
<B>114,8</B> Who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.<BR>
<B>115,1</B> Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto Thy name give glory, for Thy mercy, and for Thy truth's sake.<BR>
<B>115,2</B> Wherefore should the nations say: 'Where is now their God?'<BR>
<B>115,3</B> But our God is in the heavens; whatsoever pleased Him He hath done.<BR>
<B>115,4</B> Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.<BR>
<B>115,5</B> They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;<BR>
<B>115,6</B> They have ears, but they hear not; noses have they, but they smell not;<BR>
<B>115,7</B> They have hands, but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not; neither speak they with their throat.<BR>
<B>115,8</B> They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them.<BR>
<B>115,9</B> O Israel, trust thou in the LORD! He is their help and their shield!<BR>
<B>115,10</B> O house of Aaron, trust ye in the LORD! He is their help and their shield!<BR>
<B>115,11</B> Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield.<BR>
<B>115,12</B> The LORD hath been mindful of us, He will bless-- <B>{N}</B><BR>He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.<BR>
<B>115,13</B> He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.<BR>
<B>115,14</B> The LORD increase you more and more, you and your children.<BR>
<B>115,15</B> Blessed be ye of the LORD who made heaven and earth.<BR>
<B>115,16</B> The heavens are the heavens of the LORD; but the earth hath He given to the children of men.<BR>
<B>115,17</B> The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence;<BR>
<B>115,18</B> But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for ever. <B>{N}</B><BR>Hallelujah.<BR>
<B>116,1</B> I love that the LORD should hear my voice and my supplications.<BR>
<B>116,2</B> Because He hath inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon Him all my days.<BR>
<B>116,3</B> The cords of death compassed me, and the straits of the nether-world got hold upon me; I found trouble and sorrow.<BR>
<B>116,4</B> But I called upon the name of the LORD: 'I beseech thee, O LORD, deliver my soul.'<BR>
<B>116,5</B> Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is compassionate.<BR>
<B>116,6</B> The LORD preserveth the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me.<BR>
<B>116,7</B> Return, O my soul, unto thy rest; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.<BR>
<B>116,8</B> For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.<BR>
<B>116,9</B> I shall walk before the LORD in the lands of the living.<BR>
<B>116,10</B> I trusted even when I spoke: 'I am greatly afflicted.'<BR>
<B>116,11</B> I said in my haste: 'All men are liars.'<BR>
<B>116,12</B> How can I repay unto the LORD all His bountiful dealings toward me?<BR>
<B>116,13</B> I will lift up the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.<BR>
<B>116,14</B> My vows will I pay unto the LORD, yea, in the presence of all His people.<BR>
<B>116,15</B> Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints.<BR>
<B>116,16</B> I beseech Thee, O LORD, for I am Thy servant; <B>{N}</B><BR>I am Thy servant, the son of Thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bands.<BR>
<B>116,17</B> I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.<BR>
<B>116,18</B> I will pay my vows unto the LORD, yea, in the presence of all His people;<BR>
<B>116,19</B> In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. <B>{N}</B><BR>Hallelujah.<BR>
<B>117,1</B> O praise the LORD, all ye nations; laud Him, all ye peoples.<BR>
<B>117,2</B> For His mercy is great toward us; and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. <B>{N}</B><BR>Hallelujah.<BR>
<B>118,1</B> 'O give thanks unto the LORD, for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever.'<BR>
<B>118,2</B> So let Israel now say, for His mercy endureth for ever,<BR>
<B>118,3</B> So let the house of Aaron now say, for His mercy endureth for ever.<BR>
<B>118,4</B> So let them now that fear the LORD say, for His mercy endureth for ever.<BR>
<B>118,5</B> Out of my straits I called upon the LORD; He answered me with great enlargement.<BR>
<B>118,6</B> The LORD is for me; I will not fear; what can man do unto me?<BR>
<B>118,7</B> The LORD is for me as my helper; and I shall gaze upon them that hate me.<BR>
<B>118,8</B> It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man.<BR>
<B>118,9</B> It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes.<BR>
<B>118,10</B> All nations compass me about; verily, in the name of the LORD I will cut them off.<BR>
<B>118,11</B> They compass me about, yea, they compass me about; verily, in the name of the LORD I will cut them off.<BR>
<B>118,12</B> They compass me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns; <B>{N}</B><BR>verily, in the name of the LORD I will cut them off.<BR>
<B>118,13</B> Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall; but the LORD helped me.<BR>
<B>118,14</B> The LORD is my strength and song; and He is become my salvation.<BR>
<B>118,15</B> The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous; the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.<BR>
<B>118,16</B> The right hand of the LORD is exalted; the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.<BR>
<B>118,17</B> I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.<BR>
<B>118,18</B> The LORD hath chastened me sore; but He hath not given me over unto death.<BR>
<B>118,19</B> Open to me the gates of righteousness; I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto the LORD.<BR>
<B>118,20</B> This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter into it.<BR>
<B>118,21</B> I will give thanks unto Thee, for Thou hast answered me, and art become my salvation.<BR>
<B>118,22</B> The stone which the builders rejected is become the chief corner-stone.<BR>
<B>118,23</B> This is the LORD'S doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.<BR>
<B>118,24</B> This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.<BR>
<B>118,25</B> We beseech Thee, O LORD, save now! We beseech Thee, O LORD, make us now to prosper!<BR>
<B>118,26</B> Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD; we bless you out of the house of the LORD.<BR>
<B>118,27</B> The LORD is God, and hath given us light; order the festival procession with boughs, even unto the horns of the altar.<BR>
<B>118,28</B> Thou art my God, and I will give thanks unto Thee; Thou art my God, I will exalt Thee.<BR>
<B>118,29</B> O give thanks unto the LORD, for He is good, for His mercy endureth for ever. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>119,1</B> ALEPH. Happy are they that are upright in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.<BR>
<B>119,2</B> Happy are they that keep His testimonies, that seek Him with the whole heart.<BR>
<B>119,3</B> Yea, they do no unrighteousness; they walk in His ways.<BR>
<B>119,4</B> Thou hast ordained Thy precepts, that we should observe them diligently.<BR>
<B>119,5</B> Oh that my ways were directed to observe Thy statutes!<BR>
<B>119,6</B> Then should I not be ashamed, when I have regard unto all Thy commandments.<BR>
<B>119,7</B> I will give thanks unto Thee with uprightness of heart, when I learn Thy righteous ordinances.<BR>
<B>119,8</B> I will observe Thy statutes; O forsake me not utterly. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>119,9</B> BETH. Wherewithal shall a young man keep his way pure? By taking heed thereto according to Thy word.<BR>
<B>119,10</B> With my whole heart have I sought Thee; O let me not err from Thy commandments.<BR>
<B>119,11</B> Thy word have I laid up in my heart, that I might not sin against Thee.<BR>
<B>119,12</B> Blessed art Thou, O LORD; teach me Thy statutes.<BR>
<B>119,13</B> With my lips have I told all the ordinances of Thy mouth.<BR>
<B>119,14</B> I have rejoiced in the way of Thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.<BR>
<B>119,15</B> I will meditate in Thy precepts, and have respect unto Thy ways.<BR>
<B>119,16</B> I will delight myself in Thy statutes; I will not forget Thy word. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>119,17</B> GIMEL. Deal bountifully with Thy servant that I may live, and I will observe Thy word.<BR>
<B>119,18</B> Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law.<BR>
<B>119,19</B> I am a sojourner in the earth; hide not Thy commandments from me.<BR>
<B>119,20</B> My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto Thine ordinances at all times.<BR>
<B>119,21</B> Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, that do err from Thy commandments.<BR>
<B>119,22</B> Take away from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept Thy testimonies.<BR>
<B>119,23</B> Even though princes sit and talk against me, thy servant doth meditate in Thy statutes.<BR>
<B>119,24</B> Yea, Thy testimonies are my delight, they are my counsellors. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>119,25</B> DALETH. My soul cleaveth unto the dust; quicken Thou me according to Thy word.<BR>
<B>119,26</B> I told of my ways, and Thou didst answer me; teach me Thy statutes.<BR>
<B>119,27</B> Make me to understand the way of Thy precepts, that I may talk of Thy wondrous works.<BR>
<B>119,28</B> My soul melteth away for heaviness; sustain me according unto Thy word.<BR>
<B>119,29</B> Remove from me the way of falsehood; and grant me Thy law graciously.<BR>
<B>119,30</B> I have chosen the way of faithfulness; Thine ordinances have I set [before me].<BR>
<B>119,31</B> I cleave unto Thy testimonies; O LORD, put me not to shame.<BR>
<B>119,32</B> I will run the way of Thy commandments, for Thou dost enlarge my heart. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>119,33</B> HE. Teach me, O LORD, the way of Thy statutes; and I will keep it at every step.<BR>
<B>119,34</B> Give me understanding, that I keep Thy law and observe it with my whole heart.<BR>
<B>119,35</B> Make me to tread in the path of Thy commandments; for therein do I delight.<BR>

<P><B>119,49</B> ZAIN. Remember the word unto Thy servant, because Thou hast made me to hope.<BR>
<B>119,50</B> This is my comfort in my affliction, that Thy word hath quickened me.<BR>
<B>119,51</B> The proud have had me greatly in derision; yet have I not turned aside from Thy law.<BR>
<B>119,52</B> I have remembered Thine ordinances which are of old, O LORD, and have comforted myself.<BR>
<B>119,53</B> Burning indignation hath taken hold upon me, because of the wicked that forsake Thy law.<BR>
<B>119,54</B> Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.<BR>
<B>119,55</B> I have remembered Thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have observed Thy law.<BR>
<B>119,56</B> This I have had, that I have kept Thy precepts. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>119,57</B> HETH. My portion is the LORD, I have said that I would observe Thy words.<BR>
<B>119,58</B> I have entreated Thy favour with my whole heart; be gracious unto me according to Thy word.<BR>
<B>119,59</B> I considered my ways, and turned my feet unto Thy testimonies.<BR>
<B>119,60</B> I made haste, and delayed not, to observe Thy commandments.<BR>
<B>119,61</B> The bands of the wicked have enclosed me; but I have not forgotten Thy law.<BR>
<B>119,62</B> At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto Thee because of Thy righteous ordinances.<BR>
<B>119,63</B> I am a companion of all them that fear Thee, and of them that observe Thy precepts.<BR>
<B>119,64</B> The earth, O LORD, is full of Thy mercy; teach me Thy statutes. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>119,65</B> TETH. Thou hast dealt well with Thy servant, O LORD, according unto Thy word.<BR>
<B>119,66</B> Teach me good discernment and knowledge; for I have believed in Thy commandments.<BR>
<B>119,67</B> Before I was afflicted, I did err; but now I observe Thy word.<BR>
<B>119,68</B> Thou art good, and doest good; teach me Thy statutes.<BR>
<B>119,69</B> The proud have forged a lie against me; but I with my whole heart will keep Thy precepts.<BR>
<B>119,70</B> Their heart is gross like fat; but I delight in Thy law.<BR>
<B>119,71</B> It is good for me that I have been afflicted, in order that I might learn Thy statutes.<BR>
<B>119,72</B> The law of Thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>119,73</B> IOD. Thy hands have made me and fashioned me; give me understanding, that I may learn Thy commandments.<BR>
<B>119,74</B> They that fear Thee shall see me and be glad, because I have hope in Thy word.<BR>
<B>119,75</B> I know, O LORD, that Thy judgments are righteous, and that in faithfulness Thou hast afflicted me.<BR>
<B>119,76</B> Let, I pray Thee, Thy lovingkindness be ready to comfort me, according to Thy promise unto Thy servant.<BR>
<B>119,77</B> Let Thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live; for Thy law is my delight.<BR>
<B>119,78</B> Let the proud be put to shame, for they have distorted my cause with falsehood; but I will meditate in Thy precepts.<BR>

<B>119,82</B> Mine eyes fail for Thy word, saying: 'When wilt Thou comfort me?'<BR>
<B>119,83</B> For I am become like a wine-skin in the smoke; yet do I not forget Thy statutes.<BR>
<B>119,84</B> How many are the days of Thy servant? When wilt Thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?<BR>
<B>119,85</B> The proud have digged pits for me, which is not according to Thy law.<BR>
<B>119,86</B> All Thy commandments are faithful; they persecute me for nought; help Thou me.<BR>
<B>119,87</B> They had almost consumed me upon earth; but as for me, I forsook not Thy precepts.<BR>
<B>119,88</B> Quicken me after Thy lovingkindness, and I will observe the testimony of Thy mouth. <B>{P}</B></P>

<B>119,91</B> They stand this day according to Thine ordinances; for all things are Thy servants.<BR>
<B>119,92</B> Unless Thy law had been my delight, I should then have perished in mine affliction.<BR>
<B>119,93</B> I will never forget Thy precepts; for with them Thou hast quickened me.<BR>
<B>119,94</B> I am Thine, save me; for I have sought Thy precepts.<BR>
<B>119,95</B> The wicked have waited for me to destroy me; but I will consider Thy testimonies.<BR>

<B>119,103</B> How sweet are Thy words unto my palate! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!<BR>
<B>119,104</B> From Thy precepts I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>119,105</B> NUN. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.<BR>
<B>119,106</B> I have sworn, and have confirmed it, to observe Thy righteous ordinances.<BR>
<B>119,107</B> I am afflicted very much; quicken me, O LORD, according unto Thy word.<BR>
<B>119,108</B> Accept, I beseech Thee, the freewill-offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me Thine ordinances.<BR>
<B>119,109</B> My soul is continually in my hand; yet have I not forgotten Thy law.<BR>
<B>119,110</B> The wicked have laid a snare for me; yet went I not astray from Thy precepts.<BR>
<B>119,111</B> Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage for ever; for they are the rejoicing of my heart.<BR>
<B>119,112</B> I have inclined my heart to perform Thy statutes, for ever, at every step. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>119,113</B> SAMECH. I hate them that are of a double mind; but Thy law do I love.<BR>
<B>119,114</B> Thou art my covert and my shield; in Thy word do I hope.<BR>
<B>119,115</B> Depart from me, ye evildoers; that I may keep the commandments of my God.<BR>
<B>119,116</B> Uphold me according unto Thy word, that I may live; and put me not to shame in my hope.<BR>
<B>119,117</B> Support Thou me, and I shall be saved; and I will occupy myself with Thy statutes continually.<BR>
<B>119,118</B> Thou hast made light of all them that err from Thy statutes; for their deceit is vain.<BR>
<B>119,119</B> Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross; therefore I love Thy testimonies.<BR>
<B>119,120</B> My flesh shuddereth for fear of Thee; and I am afraid of Thy judgments. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>119,121</B> AIN. I have done justice and righteousness; leave me not to mine oppressors.<BR>
<B>119,122</B> Be surety for Thy servant for good; let not the proud oppress me.<BR>
<B>119,123</B> Mine eyes fail for Thy salvation, and for Thy righteous word.<BR>
<B>119,124</B> Deal with Thy servant according unto Thy mercy, and teach me Thy statutes.<BR>
<B>119,125</B> I am Thy servant, give me understanding, that I may know Thy testimonies.<BR>
<B>119,126</B> It is time for the LORD to work; they have made void Thy law.<BR>
<B>119,127</B> Therefore I love Thy commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold.<BR>
<B>119,128</B> Therefore I esteem all [Thy] precepts concerning all things to be right; every false way I hate. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>119,129</B> PE. Thy testimonies are wonderful; therefore doth my soul keep them.<BR>
<B>119,130</B> The opening of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.<BR>
<B>119,131</B> I opened wide my mouth, and panted; for I longed for Thy commandments.<BR>
<B>119,132</B> Turn Thee towards me, and be gracious unto me, as is Thy wont to do unto those that love Thy name.<BR>
<B>119,133</B> Order my footsteps by Thy word; and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.<BR>
<B>119,134</B> Redeem me from the oppression of man, and I will observe Thy precepts.<BR>
<B>119,135</B> Make Thy face to shine upon Thy servant; and teach me Thy statutes.<BR>
<B>119,136</B> Mine eyes run down with rivers of water, because they observe not Thy law. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>119,137</B> TZADE. Righteous art Thou, O LORD, and upright are Thy judgments.<BR>
<B>119,138</B> Thou hast commanded Thy testimonies in righteousness and exceeding faithfulness.<BR>

<B>119,156</B> Great are Thy compassions, O LORD; quicken me as Thou art wont.<BR>
<B>119,157</B> Many are my persecutors and mine adversaries; yet have I not turned aside from Thy testimonies.<BR>

<B>120,4</B> Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of broom.<BR>
<B>120,5</B> Woe is me, that I sojourn with Meshech, that I dwell beside the tents of Kedar!<BR>
<B>120,6</B> My soul hath full long had her dwelling with him that hateth peace.<BR>

<B>122,3</B> Jerusalem, that art builded as a city that is compact together;<BR>
<B>122,4</B> Whither the tribes went up, even the tribes of the LORD, as a testimony unto Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.<BR>
<B>122,5</B> For there were set thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David.<BR>
<B>122,6</B> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; may they prosper that love thee.<BR>
<B>122,7</B> Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.<BR>
<B>122,8</B> For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say: 'Peace be within thee.'<BR>
<B>122,9</B> For the sake of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good. <B>{P}</B></P>

<B>123,2</B> Behold, as the eyes of servants unto the hand of their master, <B>{N}</B><BR>as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; <B>{N}</B><BR>so our eyes look unto the LORD our God, until He be gracious unto us.<BR>
<B>123,3</B> Be gracious unto us, O LORD, be gracious unto us; for we are full sated with contempt.<BR>
<B>123,4</B> Our soul is full sated <B>{N}</B><BR>with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud oppressors. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>124,1</B> A Song of Ascents; of David. <B>{N}</B><BR>'If it had not been the LORD who was for us', let Israel now say;<BR>

<B>125,2</B> As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, <B>{N}</B><BR>so the LORD is round about His people, from this time forth and for ever.<BR>

<B>132,4</B> I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids;<BR>

<B>132,6</B> Lo, we heard of it as being in Ephrath; we found it in the field of the wood.<BR>
<B>132,7</B> Let us go into His dwelling-place; let us worship at His footstool.<BR>
<B>132,8</B> Arise, O LORD, unto Thy resting-place; Thou, and the ark of Thy strength.<BR>
<B>132,9</B> Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let Thy saints shout for joy.<BR>
<B>132,10</B> For Thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of Thine anointed.<BR>
<B>132,11</B> The LORD swore unto David in truth; He will not turn back from it: <B>{N}</B><BR>'Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.<BR>

<B>132,14</B> 'This is My resting-place for ever; here will I dwell; for I have desired it.<BR>
<B>132,15</B> I will abundantly bless her provision; I will give her needy bread in plenty.<BR>

<B>133,2</B> It is like the precious oil upon the head, <B>{N}</B><BR>coming down upon the beard; even Aaron's beard, <B>{N}</B><BR>that cometh down upon the collar of his garments;<BR>
<B>133,3</B> Like the dew of Hermon, that cometh down upon the mountains of Zion; <B>{N}</B><BR>for there the LORD commanded the blessing, <B>{N}</B><BR>even life for ever. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>134,1</B> A Song of Ascents. <B>{N}</B><BR>Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, <B>{N}</B><BR>that stand in the house of the LORD in the night seasons.<BR>

<B>135,3</B> Praise ye the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praises unto His name, for it is pleasant.<BR>
<B>135,4</B> For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto Himself, and Israel for His own treasure.<BR>
<B>135,5</B> For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.<BR>
<B>135,6</B> Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that hath He done, <B>{N}</B><BR>in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps;<BR>
<B>135,7</B> Who causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; <B>{N}</B><BR>He maketh lightnings for the rain; He bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries.<BR>
<B>135,8</B> Who smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and beast.<BR>
<B>135,9</B> He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.<BR>
<B>135,10</B> Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings:<BR>
<B>135,11</B> Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan;<BR>
<B>135,12</B> And gave their land for a heritage, a heritage unto Israel His people.<BR>
<B>135,13</B> O LORD, Thy name endureth for ever; thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.<BR>
<B>135,14</B> For the LORD will judge His people, and repent Himself for His servants.<BR>
<B>135,15</B> The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.<BR>
<B>135,16</B> They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;<BR>
<B>135,17</B> They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.<BR>
<B>135,18</B> They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them.<BR>
<B>135,19</B> O house of Israel, bless ye the LORD; O house of Aaron, bless ye the LORD;<BR>
<B>135,20</B> O house of Levi, bless ye the LORD; ye that fear the LORD, bless ye the LORD.<BR>
<B>135,21</B> Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Hallelujah. <B>{P}</B></P>

<B>136,11</B> And brought out Israel from among them, for His mercy endureth for ever;<BR>
<B>136,12</B> With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, for His mercy endureth for ever.<BR>
<B>136,13</B> To Him who divided the Red Sea in sunder, for His mercy endureth for ever;<BR>
<B>136,14</B> And made Israel to pass through the midst of it, for His mercy endureth for ever;<BR>
<B>136,15</B> But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea, for His mercy endureth for ever.<BR>
<B>136,16</B> To Him that led His people through the wilderness, for His mercy endureth for ever.<BR>

<B>136,20</B> And Og king of Bashan, for His mercy endureth for ever;<BR>
<B>136,21</B> And gave their land for a heritage, for His mercy endureth for ever;<BR>
<B>136,22</B> Even a heritage unto Israel His servant, for His mercy endureth for ever.<BR>
<B>136,23</B> Who remembered us in our low estate, for His mercy endureth for ever;<BR>
<B>136,24</B> And hath delivered us from our adversaries, for His mercy endureth for ever.<BR>
<B>136,25</B> Who giveth food to all flesh, for His mercy endureth for ever.<BR>
<B>136,26</B> O give thanks unto the God of heaven, for His mercy endureth for ever. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>137,1</B> By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.<BR>
<B>137,2</B> Upon the willows in the midst thereof we hanged up our harps.<BR>
<B>137,3</B> For there they that led us captive asked of us words of song, and our tormentors asked of us mirth: <B>{N}</B><BR>'Sing us one of the songs of Zion.'<BR>
<B>137,4</B> How shall we sing the LORD'S song in a foreign land?<BR>
<B>137,5</B> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.<BR>
<B>137,6</B> Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I remember thee not; <B>{N}</B><BR>if I set not Jerusalem above my chiefest joy.<BR>
<B>137,7</B> Remember, O LORD, against the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem; <B>{N}</B><BR>who said: 'Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.'<BR>
<B>137,8</B> O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed; <B>{N}</B><BR>happy shall he be, that repayeth thee as thou hast served us.<BR>
<B>137,9</B> Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the rock. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>138,1</B> [A Psalm] of David. I will give Thee thanks with my whole heart, in the presence of the mighty will I sing praises unto Thee.<BR>
<B>138,2</B> I will bow down toward Thy holy temple, and give thanks unto Thy name <B>{N}</B><BR>for Thy mercy and for Thy truth; <B>{N}</B><BR>for Thou hast magnified Thy word above all Thy name.<BR>
<B>138,3</B> In the day that I called, Thou didst answer me; Thou didst encourage me in my soul with strength.<BR>
<B>138,4</B> All the kings of the earth shall give Thee thanks, O LORD, for they have heard the words of Thy mouth.<BR>
<B>138,5</B> Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD; for great is the glory of the LORD.<BR>
<B>138,6</B> For though the LORD be high, yet regardeth He the lowly, and the haughty He knoweth from afar.<BR>
<B>138,7</B> Though I walk in the midst of trouble, Thou quickenest me; <B>{N}</B><BR>Thou stretchest forth Thy hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and Thy right hand doth save me.<BR>
<B>138,8</B> The LORD will accomplish that which concerneth me; Thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever; forsake not the work of Thine own hands. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>139,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of David. <B>{N}</B><BR>O LORD, Thou hast searched me, and known me.<BR>
<B>139,2</B> Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, Thou understandest my thought afar off.<BR>
<B>139,3</B> Thou measurest my going about and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.<BR>
<B>139,4</B> For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, Thou knowest it altogether.<BR>
<B>139,5</B> Thou hast hemmed me in behind and before, and laid Thy hand upon me.<BR>
<B>139,6</B> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; too high, I cannot attain unto it.<BR>
<B>139,7</B> Whither shall I go from Thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from Thy presence?<BR>
<B>139,8</B> If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there; if I make my bed in the nether-world, behold, Thou art there.<BR>
<B>139,9</B> If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;<BR>
<B>139,10</B> Even there would Thy hand lead me, and Thy right hand would hold me.<BR>
<B>139,11</B> And if I say: 'Surely the darkness shall envelop me, and the light about me shall be night';<BR>
<B>139,12</B> Even the darkness is not too dark for Thee, <B>{N}</B><BR>but the night shineth as the day; the darkness is even as the light.<BR>
<B>139,13</B> For Thou hast made my reins; Thou hast knit me together in my mother's womb.<BR>
<B>139,14</B> I will give thanks unto Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; <B>{N}</B><BR>wonderful are Thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.<BR>
<B>139,15</B> My frame was not hidden from Thee, <B>{N}</B><BR>when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.<BR>
<B>139,16</B> Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance, and in Thy book they were all written-- <B>{N}</B><BR>even the days that were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.<BR>
<B>139,17</B> How weighty also are Thy thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!<BR>
<B>139,18</B> If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand; were I to come to the end of them, I would still be with Thee.<BR>
<B>139,19</B> If Thou but wouldest slay the wicked, O God--depart from me therefore, ye men of blood;<BR>
<B>139,20</B> Who utter Thy name with wicked thought, they take it for falsehood, even Thine enemies--<BR>
<B>139,21</B> Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate Thee? And do not I strive with those that rise up against Thee?<BR>
<B>139,22</B> I hate them with utmost hatred; I count them mine enemies.<BR>
<B>139,23</B> Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts;<BR>
<B>139,24</B> And see if there be any way in me that is grievous, and lead me in the way everlasting. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>140,1</B> For the Leader. A Psalm of David.<BR>
<B>140,2</B> Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man; preserve me from the violent man;<BR>
<B>140,3</B> Who devise evil things in their heart; every day do they stir up wars.<BR>
<B>140,4</B> They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; vipers' venom is under their lips. Selah<BR>
<B>140,5</B> Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; <B>{N}</B><BR>who have purposed to make my steps slip.<BR>
<B>140,6</B> The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; <B>{N}</B><BR>they have set gins for me. Selah<BR>
<B>140,7</B> I have said unto the LORD: 'Thou art my God'; give ear, O LORD, unto the voice of my supplications.<BR>
<B>140,8</B> O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, who hast screened my head in the day of battle,<BR>
<B>140,9</B> Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; further not his evil device, so that they exalt themselves. Selah<BR>
<B>140,10</B> As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.<BR>
<B>140,11</B> Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits, that they rise not up again.<BR>
<B>140,12</B> A slanderer shall not be established in the earth; the violent and evil man shall be hunted with thrust upon thrust.<BR>
<B>140,13</B> I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the poor, and the right of the needy.<BR>
<B>140,14</B> Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto Thy name; the upright shall dwell in Thy presence. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>141,1</B> A Psalm of David. <B>{N}</B><BR>LORD, I have called Thee; make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I call unto Thee.<BR>
<B>141,2</B> Let my prayer be set forth as incense before Thee, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.<BR>
<B>141,3</B> Set a guard, O LORD, to my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.<BR>
<B>141,4</B> Incline not my heart to any evil thing, <B>{N}</B><BR>to be occupied in deeds of wickedness <B>{N}</B><BR>with men that work iniquity; <B>{N}</B><BR>and let me not eat of their dainties.<BR>
<B>141,5</B> Let the righteous smite me in kindness, and correct me; <B>{N}</B><BR>oil so choice let not my head refuse; <B>{N}</B><BR>for still is my prayer because of their wickedness.<BR>
<B>141,6</B> Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; and they shall hear my words, that they are sweet.<BR>
<B>141,7</B> As when one cleaveth and breaketh up the earth, our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth.<BR>
<B>141,8</B> For mine eyes are unto Thee, O GOD the Lord; in Thee have I taken refuge, O pour not out my soul.<BR>
<B>141,9</B> Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the gins of the workers of iniquity.<BR>
<B>141,10</B> Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst I withal escape. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>142,1</B> Maschil of David, <B>{N}</B><BR>when he was in the cave; a Prayer.<BR>
<B>142,2</B> With my voice I cry unto the LORD; with my voice I make supplication unto the LORD.<BR>
<B>142,3</B> I pour out my complaint before Him, I declare before Him my trouble;<BR>
<B>142,4</B> When my spirit fainteth within me--Thou knowest my path-- <B>{N}</B><BR>in the way wherein I walk have they hidden a snare for me.<BR>
<B>142,5</B> Look on my right hand, and see, for there is no man that knoweth me; <B>{N}</B><BR>I have no way to flee; no man careth for my soul.<BR>
<B>142,6</B> I have cried unto Thee, O LORD; <B>{N}</B><BR>I have said: 'Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.'<BR>
<B>142,7</B> Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low; <B>{N}</B><BR>deliver me from my persecutors; for they are too strong for me.<BR>
<B>142,8</B> Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto Thy name; <B>{N}</B><BR>the righteous shall crown themselves because of me; for Thou wilt deal bountifully with me. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>143,1</B> A Psalm of David. <B>{N}</B><BR>O LORD, hear my prayer, give ear to my supplications; <B>{N}</B><BR>in Thy faithfulness answer me, and in Thy righteousness.<BR>
<B>143,2</B> And enter not into judgment with Thy servant; <B>{N}</B><BR>for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.<BR>
<B>143,3</B> For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath crushed my life down to the ground; <B>{N}</B><BR>he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.<BR>
<B>143,4</B> And my spirit fainteth within me; my heart within me is appalled.<BR>
<B>143,5</B> I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Thy doing; <B>{N}</B><BR>I muse on the work of Thy hands.<BR>
<B>143,6</B> I spread forth my hands unto Thee; my soul [thirsteth] after Thee, as a weary land. Selah<BR>
<B>143,7</B> Answer me speedily, O LORD, my spirit faileth; <B>{N}</B><BR>hide not Thy face from me; lest I become like them that go down into the pit.<BR>
<B>143,8</B> Cause me to hear Thy lovingkindness in the morning, for in Thee do I trust; <B>{N}</B><BR>cause me to know the way wherein I should walk, for unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.<BR>
<B>143,9</B> Deliver me from mine enemies, O LORD; with Thee have I hidden myself.<BR>
<B>143,10</B> Teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my God; <B>{N}</B><BR>let Thy good spirit lead me in an even land.<BR>
<B>143,11</B> For Thy name's sake, O LORD, quicken me; in Thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.<BR>
<B>143,12</B> And in Thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that harass my soul; for I am Thy servant. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>144,1</B> [A Psalm] of David. Blessed be the LORD my Rock, who traineth my hands for war, <B>{N}</B><BR>and my fingers for battle;<BR>
<B>144,2</B> My lovingkindness, and my fortress, my high tower, and my deliverer; <B>{N}</B><BR>my shield, and He in whom I take refuge; who subdueth my people under me.<BR>
<B>144,3</B> LORD, what is man, that Thou takest knowledge of him? or the son of man, that Thou makest account of him?<BR>
<B>144,4</B> Man is like unto a breath; his days are as a shadow that passeth away.<BR>
<B>144,5</B> O LORD, bow Thy heavens, and come down; touch the mountains, that they may smoke.<BR>
<B>144,6</B> Cast forth lightning, and scatter them; send out Thine arrows, and discomfit them.<BR>
<B>144,7</B> Stretch forth Thy hands from on high; rescue me, and deliver me out of many waters, out of the hand of strangers;<BR>
<B>144,8</B> Whose mouth speaketh falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of lying.<BR>
<B>144,9</B> O God, I will sing a new song unto Thee, upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto Thee;<BR>
<B>144,10</B> Who givest salvation unto kings, who rescuest David Thy servant from the hurtful sword.<BR>
<B>144,11</B> Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of strangers, <B>{N}</B><BR>whose mouth speaketh falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of lying.<BR>
<B>144,12</B> We whose sons are as plants grown up in their youth; <B>{N}</B><BR>whose daughters are as corner-pillars carved after the fashion of a palace;<BR>
<B>144,13</B> Whose garners are full, affording all manner of store; <B>{N}</B><BR>whose sheep increase by thousands and ten thousands in our fields;<BR>
<B>144,14</B> Whose oxen are well laden; with no breach, and no going forth, and no outcry in our broad places;<BR>
<B>144,15</B> Happy is the people that is in such a case. Yea, happy is the people whose God is the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>

<B>145,3</B> Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; and His greatness is unsearchable.<BR>
<B>145,4</B> One generation shall laud Thy works to another, and shall declare Thy mighty acts.<BR>
<B>145,5</B> The glorious splendour of Thy majesty, and Thy wondrous works, will I rehearse.<BR>

<B>145,8</B> The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.<BR>
<B>145,9</B> The LORD is good to all; and His tender mercies are over all His works.<BR>
<B>145,10</B> All Thy works shall praise Thee, O LORD; and Thy saints shall bless Thee.<BR>
<B>145,11</B> They shall speak of the glory of Thy kingdom, and talk of Thy might;<BR>
<B>145,12</B> To make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, and the glory of the majesty of His kingdom.<BR>
<B>145,13</B> Thy kingdom is a kingdom for all ages, and Thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.<BR>
<B>145,14</B> The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that are bowed down.<BR>
<B>145,15</B> The eyes of all wait for Thee, and Thou givest them their food in due season.<BR>
<B>145,16</B> Thou openest Thy hand, and satisfiest every living thing with favour.<BR>
<B>145,17</B> The LORD is righteous in all His ways, and gracious in all His works.<BR>
<B>145,18</B> The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon Him, to all that call upon Him in truth.<BR>

<B>146,3</B> Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.<BR>
<B>146,4</B> His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his dust; in that very day his thoughts perish.<BR>
<B>146,5</B> Happy is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God,<BR>
<B>146,6</B> Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is; <B>{N}</B><BR>who keepeth truth for ever;<BR>

<B>147,19</B> He declareth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and His ordinances unto Israel.<BR>

<B>149,4</B> For the LORD taketh pleasure in His people; He adorneth the humble with salvation.<BR>
<B>149,5</B> Let the saints exult in glory; let them sing for joy upon their beds.<BR>
<B>149,6</B> Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand;<BR>
<B>149,7</B> To execute vengeance upon the nations, and chastisements upon the peoples;<BR>
