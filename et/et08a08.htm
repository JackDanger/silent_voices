<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">1 Samuel Chapter 8</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beer-sheba.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<P><B>4</B> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And they said unto him: 'Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways; now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said: 'Give us a king to judge us.' And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<P><B>7</B> And the LORD said unto Samuel: 'Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected Me, that I should not be king over them.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken Me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Now therefore hearken unto their voice; howbeit thou shalt earnestly forewarn them, and shalt declare unto them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And he said: 'This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> He will take the tenth of your flocks; and ye shall be his servants.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not answer you in that day.'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said: 'Nay; but there shall be a king over us;
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.'
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he spoke them in the ears of the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<P><B>22</B> And the LORD said to Samuel: 'Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king.' And Samuel said unto the men of Israel: 'Go ye every man unto his city.' <B>{P}</B></P>
