<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed to Zaphon; and they said unto Jephthah: 'Wherefore didst thou pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And Jephthah said unto them: 'I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye saved me not out of their hand.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And when I saw that ye saved me not, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand; wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said: 'Ye are fugitives of Ephraim, ye Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites; and it was so, that when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said: 'Let me go over,' the men of Gilead said unto him: 'Art thou an Ephraimite?' If he said: 'Nay';
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> then said they unto him: 'Say now Shibboleth'; and he said 'Sibboleth'; for he could not frame to pronounce it right; then they laid hold on him, and slew him at the fords of the Jordan; and there fell at that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<P><B>8</B> And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> and Ibzan died, and was buried at Beth-lehem. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<P><B>11</B> And after him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<P><B>13</B> And after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And he had forty sons and thirty sons' sons, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts; and he judged Israel eight years.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekites. <B>{P}</B></P>
