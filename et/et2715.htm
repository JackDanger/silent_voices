<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Job Chapter 15</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> <B>{S}</B> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:<BR>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Should a wise man make answer with windy knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?<BR>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Yea, thou doest away with fear, and impairest devotion before God.<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; yea, thine own lips testify against thee.<BR>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Art thou the first man that was born? Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?<BR>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Dost thou hearken in the council of God? And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> What knowest thou, that we know not? What understandest thou, which is not in us?<BR>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, much older than thy father.<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Are the consolations of God too small for thee, and the word that dealeth gently with thee?<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Why doth thy heart carry thee away? And why do thine eyes wink?<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth.<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Behold, He putteth no trust in His holy ones; yea, the heavens are not clean in His sight.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> How much less one that is abominable and impure, man who drinketh iniquity like water!<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> I will tell thee, hear thou me; and that which I have seen I will declare--<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it;<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Unto whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them.<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> A sound of terrors is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> He wandereth abroad for bread: 'Where is it?' He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> Distress and anguish overwhelm him; they prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, and behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;<BR>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> He runneth upon him with a stiff neck, with the thick bosses of his bucklers.<BR>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, and made collops of fat on his loins;<BR>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, in houses which no man would inhabit, which were ready to become heaps.<BR>
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall their produce bend to the earth.<BR>
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of His mouth shall he go away.<BR>
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; for vanity shall be his recompense.<BR>
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be leafy.<BR>
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.<BR>
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> For the company of the godless shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery.<BR>
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</P>
