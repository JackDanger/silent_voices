<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Jonah Chapter 3</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> 'Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and make unto it the proclamation that I bid thee.'
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days' journey.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he proclaimed, and said: 'Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying: 'Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing; let them not feed, nor drink water;
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not?'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, which He said He would do unto them; and He did it not.</P>
