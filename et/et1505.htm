<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Amos Chapter 5</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Hear ye this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> The virgin of Israel is fallen, she shall no more rise; she is cast down upon her land, there is none to raise her up.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> For thus saith the Lord GOD: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, of the house of Israel.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel: Seek ye Me, and live;
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> But seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba; for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Seek the LORD, and live--lest He break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Bethel--
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and cast righteousness to the ground;
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Him that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, and bringeth on the shadow of death in the morning, and darkeneth the day into night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; the LORD is His name;
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> That causeth destruction to flash upon the strong, so that destruction cometh upon the fortress.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Therefore, because ye trample upon the poor, and take from him exactions of wheat; ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them, ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine thereof.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins; ye that afflict the just, that take a ransom, and that turn aside the needy in the gate.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Therefore the prudent doth keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so the LORD, the God of hosts, will be with you, as ye say.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate; it may be that the LORD, the God of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord: Lamentation shall be in all the broad places, and they shall say in all the streets: 'Alas! alas!' and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and proclaim lamentation to such as are skilful of wailing.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And in all vineyards shall be lamentation; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<P><B>18</B> Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! Wherefore would ye have the day of the LORD? It is darkness, and not light.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; and went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? Even very dark, and no brightness in it?
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Yea, though ye offer me burnt-offerings and your meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> Take thou away from Me the noise of thy songs; and let Me not hear the melody of thy psalteries.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> But let justice well up as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> Did ye bring unto Me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> So shall ye take up Siccuth your king and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith He, whose name is the LORD God of hosts. <B>{P}</B></P>
