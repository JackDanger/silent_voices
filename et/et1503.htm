<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Amos Chapter 3</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Will two walk together, except they have agreed?
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? Will a young lion give forth his voice out of his den, if he have taken nothing?
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Will a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where there is no lure for it? Will a snare spring up from the ground, and have taken nothing at all?
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Shall the horn be blown in a city, and the people not tremble? Shall evil befall a city, and the LORD hath not done it?
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> For the Lord GOD will do nothing, but He revealeth His counsel unto His servants the prophets.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> The lion hath roared, who will not fear? The Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Proclaim it upon the palaces at Ashdod, and upon the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say: 'Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great confusions therein, and the oppressions in the midst thereof.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<P><B>11</B> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: An adversary, even round about the land! And he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Thus saith the LORD: As the shepherd rescueth out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the children of Israel that dwell in Samaria escape with the corner of a couch, and the leg of a bed.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Hear ye, and testify against the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> For in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also punish the altars of Beth-el, and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And I will smite the winter-house with the summer-house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD. <B>{S}</B></P>
