<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">1 Samuel Chapter 16</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the LORD said unto Samuel: 'How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided Me a king among his sons.'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And Samuel said: 'How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.' And the LORD said: 'Take a heifer with thee, and say: I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will tell thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint unto Me him whom I name unto thee.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said: 'Comest thou peaceably?'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And he said: 'Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.' And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And it came to pass, when they were come, that he beheld Eliab, and said: 'Surely the LORD'S anointed is before Him.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> But the LORD said unto Samuel: 'Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him; for it is not as man seeth: for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said: 'Neither hath the LORD chosen this.'
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said: 'Neither hath the LORD chosen this.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse: 'The LORD hath not chosen these.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And Samuel said unto Jesse: 'Are here all thy children?' And he said: 'There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep.' And Samuel said unto Jesse: 'Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of beautiful eyes, and goodly to look upon. <B>{P}</B><BR> <BR>And the LORD said: 'Arise, anoint him; for this is he.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren; and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Now the spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD terrified him.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And Saul's servants said unto him: 'Behold now, an evil spirit from God terrifieth thee.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp; and it shall be, when the evil spirit from God cometh upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<P><B>17</B> And Saul said unto his servants: 'Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.'
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Then answered one of the young men, and said: 'Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valour, and a man of war, and prudent in affairs, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said: 'Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And David came to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour-bearer.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And Saul sent to Jesse, saying: 'Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.'
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand; so Saul found relief, and it was well with him, and the evil spirit departed from him. <B>{P}</B></P>
