<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Proverbs Chapter 18</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> He that separateth himself seeketh his own desire, and snarlest against all sound wisdom.<BR>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> A fool hath no delight in understanding, but only that his heart may lay itself bare.<BR>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters; a flowing brook, a fountain of wisdom.<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> It is not good to respect the person of the wicked, so as to turn aside the righteous in judgment.<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.<BR>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> A fool's mouth is his ruin, and his lips are the snare of his soul.<BR>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Even one that is slack in his work is brother to him that is a destroyer.<BR>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is set up on high.<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as a high wall in his own conceit.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Before destruction the heart of a man is haughty, and before honour goeth humility.<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> He that giveth answer before he heareth, it is folly and confusion unto him.<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a broken spirit who can bear?<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> He that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him out.<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> The lot causeth strife to cease, and parteth asunder the contentious.<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city; and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> A man's belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth; with the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied.<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Death and life are in the power of the tongue; and they that indulge it shall eat the fruit thereof.<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a great good, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> The poor useth entreaties; but the rich answereth impudently.<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> There are friends that one hath to his own hurt; but there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.</P>
