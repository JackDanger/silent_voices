<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for purification and for sprinkling.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begot him shall say unto him: 'Thou shalt not live, for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD'; and his father and his mother that begot him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be brought to shame every one through his vision, when he prophesieth; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive;
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> but he shall say: 'I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondman from my youth.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And one shall say unto him: 'What are these wounds between thy hands?' Then he shall answer: 'Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<P><B>7</B> Awake, O sword, against My shepherd, and against the man that is near unto Me, saith the LORD of hosts; smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn My hand upon the little ones.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried; they shall call on My name, and I will answer them; I will say: 'It is My people', and they shall say: 'The LORD is my God.' <B>{P}</B></P>
