<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">2 Kings Chapter 2</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And Elijah said unto Elisha: 'Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me as far as Beth-el.' And Elisha said: 'As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' So they went down to Beth-el.--
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him: 'Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day?' And he said: 'Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.'--
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And Elijah said unto him: 'Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho.' And he said: 'As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' So they came to Jericho.--
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him: 'Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day?' And he answered: 'Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.'--
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And Elijah said unto him: 'Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to the Jordan.' And he said: 'As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' And they two went on.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off; and they two stood by the Jordan.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha: 'Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken from thee.' And Elisha said: 'I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And he said: 'Thou hast asked a hard thing; nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both assunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And Elisha saw it, and he cried: 'My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!' And he saw him no more; and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said: 'Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?' and when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided hither and thither; and Elisha went over.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho some way off saw him, they said: 'The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha.' And they came to meet him, and bowed down to the ground before him.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And they said unto him: 'Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master; lest peradventure the spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.' And he said: 'Ye shall not send.'
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said: 'Send.' They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto them: 'Did I not say unto you: Go not?' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And the men of the city said unto Elisha: 'Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth; but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And he said: 'Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein.' And they brought it to him.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said: 'Thus saith the LORD: I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying.'
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<P><B>23</B> And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him: 'Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.'
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two children of them.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria. <B>{P}</B></P>
