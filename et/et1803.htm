<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Micah Chapter 3</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And I said: Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know justice?
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Who hate the good, and love the evil; who rob their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones; yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but He will not answer them; yea, He will hide His face from them at that time, according as they have wrought evil in their doings. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<P><B>5</B> Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people to err; that cry: 'Peace', when their teeth have any thing to bite; and whoso putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their upper lips; for there shall be no answer of God.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> But I truly am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of justice, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor justice, and pervert all equity;
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> That build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money; yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say: 'Is not the LORD in the midst of us? No evil shall come upon us'?
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. <B>{P}</B></P>
