<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Say unto Aaron: Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the canals, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And the magicians did in like manner with their secret arts, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said: 'Entreat the LORD, that He take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto the LORD.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And Moses said unto Pharaoh: 'Have thou this glory over me; against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And he said: 'Against to-morrow.' And he said: 'Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto the LORD concerning the frogs, which He had brought upon Pharaoh.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And they gathered them together in heaps; and the land stank.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Say unto Aaron: Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were gnats upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And the magicians did so with their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not; and there were gnats upon man, and upon beast.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh: 'This is the finger of God'; and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him: Thus saith the LORD: Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Else, if thou wilt not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end that thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And I will put a division between My people and thy people--by to-morrow shall this sign be.'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And the LORD did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses; and in all the land of Egypt the land was ruined by reason of the swarms of flies.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said: 'Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.'
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And Moses said: 'It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God; lo, if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us?
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as He shall command us.'
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And Pharaoh said: 'I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away; entreat for me.'
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And Moses said: 'Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.'
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go. <B>{P}</B></P>
