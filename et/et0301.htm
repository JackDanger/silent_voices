<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Leviticus Chapter 1</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the LORD called unto Moses, and spoke unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When any man of you bringeth an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd or of the flock.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish; he shall bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD; and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and dash the blood round about against the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, and the head, and the suet, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar;
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall make the whole smoke on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And if his offering be of the flock, whether of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD; and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall dash its blood against the altar round about.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And he shall cut it into its pieces; and the priest shall lay them, with its head and its suet, in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> But the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall offer the whole, and make it smoke upon the altar; it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<P><B>14</B> And if his offering to the LORD be a burnt-offering of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and pinch off its head, and make it smoke on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And he shall take away its crop with the feathers thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And he shall rend it by the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder; and the priest shall make it smoke upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire; it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. <B>{S}</B></P>
