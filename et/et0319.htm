<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Leviticus Chapter 19</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them: Ye shall be holy; for I the LORD your God am holy.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and ye shall keep My sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Turn ye not unto the idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow; and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is a vile thing; it shall not be accepted.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> But every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from his people.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And ye shall not swear by My name falsely, so that thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbour, nor rob him; the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but thou shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment; thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor favour the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart; thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Ye shall keep My statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind; thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed; neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, designated for a man, and not at all redeemed, nor was freedom given her; there shall be inquisition; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And he shall bring his forfeit unto the LORD, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a guilt-offering.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned; and he shall be forgiven for his sin which he hath sinned. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<P><B>23</B> And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as forbidden; three years shall it be as forbidden unto you; it shall not be eaten.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto the LORD.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> But in the fifth year may ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you more richly the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> Ye shall not eat with the blood; neither shall ye practise divination nor soothsaying.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor imprint any marks upon you: I am the LORD.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot, lest the land fall into harlotry, and the land become full of lewdness.
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary: I am the LORD.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> Turn ye not unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar spirits; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and thou shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> And ye shall observe all My statutes, and all Mine ordinances, and do them: I am the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
