<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Jeremiah Chapter 30</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> 'Thus speaketh the LORD, the God of Israel, saying: Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will turn the captivity of My people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<P><B>4</B> And these are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> For thus saith the LORD: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child; wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it; and it is a time of trouble unto Jacob, but out of it shall he be saved.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bands; and strangers shall no more make him their bondman;
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob My servant, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel; for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall again be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; for I will correct thee in measure, and will not utterly destroy thee. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<P><B>12</B> For thus saith the LORD: Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> None deemeth of thy wound that it may be bound up; thou hast no healing medicines.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> All thy lovers have forgotten thee, they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one; for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Why criest thou for thy hurt, that thy pain is incurable? For the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured, and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they have called thee an outcast: 'She is Zion, there is none that careth for her.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will turn the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be builded upon her own mound, and the palace shall be inhabited upon its wonted place.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry; and I will multiply them, and they shall not be diminished, I will also increase them, and they shall not dwindle away.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before Me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto Me; for who is he that hath pledged his heart to approach unto Me? saith the LORD.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And ye shall be My people, and I will be your God. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> Behold, a storm of the LORD is gone forth in fury, a sweeping storm; it shall whirl upon the head of the wicked.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until He have executed, and till He have performed the purposes of His heart; in the end of days ye shall consider it.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> At that time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be My people. <B>{S}</B></P>
