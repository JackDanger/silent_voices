<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">2 Samuel Chapter 5</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spoke, saying: 'Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that didst lead out and bring in Israel; and the LORD said to thee: Thou shalt feed My people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.'
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke unto David, saying: 'Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither'; thinking: 'David cannot come in hither.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And David said on that day: 'Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, and getteth up to the gutter, and [taketh away] the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul--.' Wherefore they say: 'There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.'
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And David waxed greater and greater; for the LORD, the God of hosts, was with him. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<P><B>11</B> And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for His people Israel's sake. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon;
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia;
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<P><B>17</B> And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And David inquired of the LORD, saying: 'Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt Thou deliver them into my hand?' <B>{P}</B><BR> <BR>And the LORD said unto David: 'Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.'
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said: 'The LORD hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters.' Therefore the name of that place was called Baal-perazim.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<P><B>22</B> And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And when David inquired of the LORD, He said: 'Thou shalt not go up; make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is the LORD gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.'
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And David did so, as the LORD commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
