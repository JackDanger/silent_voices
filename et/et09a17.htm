<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the settlers of Gilead, said unto Ahab: 'As the LORD, the God of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying:
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> 'Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying:
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> 'Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.'
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her, and said: 'Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said: 'Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.'
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And she said: 'As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, only a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse; and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And Elijah said unto her: 'Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: The jar of meal shall not be spent, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the land.'
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah; and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> The jar of meal was not spent, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which He spoke by Elijah. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<P><B>17</B> And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And she said unto Elijah: 'What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And he said unto her: 'Give me thy son.' And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the upper chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And he cried unto the LORD, and said: 'O LORD my God, hast Thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?'
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said: 'O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come back into him.'
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And the LORD hearkened unto the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came back into him, and he revived.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the upper chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother; and Elijah said: 'See, thy son liveth.'
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And the woman said to Elijah: 'Now I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.' <B>{P}</B></P>
