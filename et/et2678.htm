<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Psalms Chapter 78</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Maschil of Asaph. <B>{N}</B><BR>Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<BR>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter dark sayings concerning days of old;<BR>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> That which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us,<BR>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> We will not hide from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, <B>{N}</B><BR>and His strength, and His wondrous works that He hath done.<BR>
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> For He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, <B>{N}</B><BR>which He commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;<BR>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; who should arise and tell them to their children,<BR>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> That they might put their confidence in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments;<BR>
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; <B>{N}</B><BR>a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.<BR>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> The children of Ephraim were as archers handling the bow, that turned back in the day of battle.<BR>
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in His law;<BR>
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And they forgot His doings, and His wondrous works that He had shown them.<BR>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> Marvellous things did He in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<BR>
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> He cleaved the sea, and caused them to pass through; and He made the waters to stand as a heap.<BR>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> By day also He led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.<BR>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> He cleaved rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the great deep.<BR>
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.<BR>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> Yet went they on still to sin against Him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.<BR>
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And they tried God in their heart by asking food for their craving.<BR>
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> Yea, they spoke against God; they said: 'Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?<BR>
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Behold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; <B>{N}</B><BR>can He give bread also? or will He provide flesh for His people?'<BR>
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> Therefore the LORD heard, and was wroth; <B>{N}</B><BR>and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel;<BR>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in His salvation.<BR>
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven;<BR>
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And He caused manna to rain upon them for food, and gave them of the corn of heaven.<BR>
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> Man did eat the bread of the mighty; He sent them provisions to the full.<BR>
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> He caused the east wind to set forth in heaven; and by His power He brought on the south wind.<BR>
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> He caused flesh also to rain upon them as the dust, and winged fowl as the sand of the seas;<BR>
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And He let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their dwellings.<BR>
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> So they did eat, and were well filled; and He gave them that which they craved.<BR>
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> They were not estranged from their craving, their food was yet in their mouths,<BR>
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> When the anger of God went up against them, and slew of the lustieth among them, <B>{N}</B><BR>and smote down the young men of Israel.<BR>
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> For all this they sinned still, and believed not in His wondrous works.<BR>
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> Therefore He ended their days as a breath, and their years in terror.<BR>
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> When He slew them, then they would inquire after Him, and turn back and seek God earnestly.<BR>
<A NAME="35"> </A>
<B>35</B> And they remembered that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their redeemer.<BR>
<A NAME="36"> </A>
<B>36</B> But they beguiled Him with their mouth, and lied unto Him with their tongue.<BR>
<A NAME="37"> </A>
<B>37</B> For their heart was not stedfast with Him, neither were they faithful in His covenant.<BR>
<A NAME="38"> </A>
<B>38</B> But He, being full of compassion, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not; <B>{N}</B><BR>yea, many a time doth He turn His anger away, and doth not stir up all His wrath.<BR>
<A NAME="39"> </A>
<B>39</B> So He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.<BR>
<A NAME="40"> </A>
<B>40</B> How oft did they rebel against Him in the wilderness, and grieve Him in the desert!<BR>
<A NAME="41"> </A>
<B>41</B> And still again they tried God, and set bounds to the Holy One of Israel.<BR>
<A NAME="42"> </A>
<B>42</B> They remembered not His hand, nor the day when He redeemed them from the adversary.<BR>
<A NAME="43"> </A>
<B>43</B> How He set His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the field of Zoan;<BR>
<A NAME="44"> </A>
<B>44</B> And turned their rivers into blood, so that they could not drink their streams.<BR>
<A NAME="45"> </A>
<B>45</B> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.<BR>
<A NAME="46"> </A>
<B>46</B> He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust.<BR>
<A NAME="47"> </A>
<B>47</B> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore-trees with frost.<BR>
<A NAME="48"> </A>
<B>48</B> He gave over their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to fiery bolts.<BR>
<A NAME="49"> </A>
<B>49</B> He sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, a sending of messengers of evil.<BR>
<A NAME="50"> </A>
<B>50</B> He levelled a path for His anger; He spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;<BR>
<A NAME="51"> </A>
<B>51</B> And smote all the first-born in Egypt, the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham;<BR>
<A NAME="52"> </A>
<B>52</B> But He made His own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<BR>
<A NAME="53"> </A>
<B>53</B> And He led them safely, and they feared not; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<BR>
<A NAME="54"> </A>
<B>54</B> And He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain, which His right hand had gotten.<BR>
<A NAME="55"> </A>
<B>55</B> He drove out the nations also before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, <B>{N}</B><BR>and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<BR>
<A NAME="56"> </A>
<B>56</B> Yet they tried and provoked God, the Most High, and kept not His testimonies;<BR>
<A NAME="57"> </A>
<B>57</B> But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers; they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.<BR>
<A NAME="58"> </A>
<B>58</B> For they provoked Him with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.<BR>
<A NAME="59"> </A>
<B>59</B> God heard, and was wroth, and He greatly abhorred Israel;<BR>
<A NAME="60"> </A>
<B>60</B> And He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He had made to dwell among men;<BR>
<A NAME="61"> </A>
<B>61</B> And delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the adversary's hand.<BR>
<A NAME="62"> </A>
<B>62</B> He gave His people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with His inheritance.<BR>
<A NAME="63"> </A>
<B>63</B> Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins had no marriage-song.<BR>
<A NAME="64"> </A>
<B>64</B> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.<BR>
<A NAME="65"> </A>
<B>65</B> Then the Lord awaked as one asleep, like a mighty man recovering from wine.<BR>
<A NAME="66"> </A>
<B>66</B> And He smote His adversaries backward; He put upon them a perpetual reproach.<BR>
<A NAME="67"> </A>
<B>67</B> Moreover He abhorred the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;<BR>
<A NAME="68"> </A>
<B>68</B> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which He loved.<BR>
<A NAME="69"> </A>
<B>69</B> And He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which He hath founded for ever.<BR>
<A NAME="70"> </A>
<B>70</B> He chose David also His servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;<BR>
<A NAME="71"> </A>
<B>71</B> From following the ewes that give suck He brought him, to be shepherd over Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.<BR>
<A NAME="72"> </A>
<B>72</B> So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart; and lead them by the skilfulness of his hands. <B>{P}</B></P>
