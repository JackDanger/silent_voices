<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Exodus Chapter 19</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying: 'Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto Myself.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> Now therefore, if ye will hearken unto My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be Mine own treasure from among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine;
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD commanded him.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And all the people answered together, and said: 'All that the LORD hath spoken we will do.' And Moses reported the words of the people unto the LORD.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever.' And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments,
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> and be ready against the third day; for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying: Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it; whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death;
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live; when the ram's horn soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And he said unto the people: 'Be ready against the third day; come not near a woman.'
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a horn exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Now mount Sinai was altogether on smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And when the voice of the horn waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount; and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And let the priests also, that come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.'
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And Moses said unto the LORD: 'The people cannot come up to mount Sinai; for thou didst charge us, saying: Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.'
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And the LORD said unto him: 'Go, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest He break forth upon them.'
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> So Moses went down unto the people, and told them. <B>{S}</B></P>
