<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the LORD remembered Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as He had spoken.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And Sarah said: 'God hath made laughter for me; every one that heareth will laugh on account of me.'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And she said: 'Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, making sport.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Wherefore she said unto Abraham: 'Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And God said unto Abraham: 'Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall seed be called to thee.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.'
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And Abraham arose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and strayed in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow-shot; for she said: 'Let me not look upon the death of the child.' And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her: 'What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him fast by thy hand; for I will make him a great nation.'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<P><B>22</B> And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spoke unto Abraham, saying: 'God is with thee in all that thou doest.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son; but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.'
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And Abraham said: 'I will swear.'
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And Abimelech said: 'I know not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.'
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant.
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And Abimelech said unto Abraham: 'What mean these seven ewe-lambs which thou hast set by themselves?'
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And he said: 'Verily, these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.'
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> Wherefore that place was called Beer-sheba; because there they swore both of them.
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba; and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> And Abraham planted a tamarisk-tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days. <B>{P}</B></P>
