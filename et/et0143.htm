<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the famine was sore in the land.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, that their father said unto them: 'Go again, buy us a little food.'
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And Judah spoke unto him, saying: 'The man did earnestly forewarn us, saying: Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food;
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down, for the man said unto us: Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And Israel said: 'Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And they said: 'The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying: Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words; could we in any wise know that he would say: Bring your brother down?'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Judah said unto Israel his father: 'Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him; if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> For except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And their father Israel said unto them: 'If it be so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and ladanum, nuts, and almonds;
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry back in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight;
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man;
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.'
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house: 'Bring the men into the house, and kill the beasts, and prepare the meat; for the men shall dine with me at noon.'
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said: 'Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.'
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke unto him at the door of the house,
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> and said: 'Oh my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; and we have brought it back in our hand.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food. We know not who put our money in our sacks.'
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And he said: 'Peace be to you, fear not; your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money.' And he brought Simeon out unto them.
<A NAME="24"> </A>
<B>24</B> And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
<A NAME="25"> </A>
<B>25</B> And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon; for they heard that they should eat bread there.
<A NAME="26"> </A>
<B>26</B> And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down to him to the earth.
<A NAME="27"> </A>
<B>27</B> And he asked them of their welfare, and said: 'Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?'
<A NAME="28"> </A>
<B>28</B> And they said: 'Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive.' And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.
<A NAME="29"> </A>
<B>29</B> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said: 'Is this your youngest brother of whom ye spoke unto me?' And he said: 'God be gracious unto thee, my son.'
<A NAME="30"> </A>
<B>30</B> And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned toward his brother; and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
<A NAME="31"> </A>
<B>31</B> And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said: 'Set on bread.'
<A NAME="32"> </A>
<B>32</B> And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
<A NAME="33"> </A>
<B>33</B> And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marvelled one with another.
<A NAME="34"> </A>
<B>34</B> And portions were taken unto them from before him; but Benjamin's portion was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</P>
