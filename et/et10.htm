<P><B>1,1</B> The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
<B>1,2</B> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the LORD hath spoken: Children I have reared, and brought up, and they have rebelled against Me.
<B>1,3</B> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but Israel doth not know, My people doth not consider.
<B>1,4</B> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly; they have forsaken the LORD, they have contemned the Holy One of Israel, they are turned away backward.
<B>1,5</B> On what part will ye yet be stricken, seeing ye stray away more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint;
<B>1,6</B> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and festering sores: they have not been pressed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.
<B>1,7</B> Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by floods.
<B>1,8</B> And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
<B>1,9</B> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>1,10</B> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
<B>1,11</B> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me? saith the LORD; I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.
<B>1,12</B> When ye come to appear before Me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample My courts?
<B>1,13</B> Bring no more vain oblations; it is an offering of abomination unto Me; new moon and sabbath, the holding of convocations--I cannot endure iniquity along with the solemn assembly.
<B>1,14</B> Your new moons and your appointed seasons My soul hateth; they are a burden unto Me; I am weary to bear them.
<B>1,15</B> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide Mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.
<B>1,16</B> Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes, cease to do evil;
<B>1,17</B> Learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. <B>{S}</B>
<B>1,18</B> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
<B>1,19</B> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land;
<B>1,20</B> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>1,21</B> How is the faithful city become a harlot! She that was full of justice, righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
<B>1,22</B> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.
<B>1,23</B> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards; they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. <B>{S}</B>
<B>1,24</B> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah, I will ease Me of Mine adversaries, and avenge Me of Mine enemies;
<B>1,25</B> And I will turn My hand upon thee, and purge away thy dross as with lye, and will take away all thine alloy;
<B>1,26</B> And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning; afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.
<B>1,27</B> Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and they that return of her with righteousness.
<B>1,28</B> But the destruction of the transgressors and the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
<B>1,29</B> For they shall be ashamed of the terebinths which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
<B>1,30</B> For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.
<B>1,31</B> And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>2,1</B> The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
<B>2,2</B> And it shall come to pass in the end of days, that the mountain of the LORD'S house shall be established as the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.
<B>2,3</B> And many peoples shall go and say: 'Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths.' For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
<B>2,4</B> And He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>2,5</B> O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.
<B>2,6</B> For Thou hast forsaken Thy people the house of Jacob; for they are replenished from the east, and with soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the brood of aliens.
<B>2,7</B> Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land also is full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.
<B>2,8</B> Their land also is full of idols; every one worshippeth the work of his own hands, that which his own fingers have made.
<B>2,9</B> And man boweth down, and man lowereth himself; and Thou canst not bear with them.
<B>2,10</B> Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the glory of His majesty.
<B>2,11</B> The lofty looks of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>2,12</B> For the LORD of hosts hath a day upon all that is proud and lofty, and upon all that is lifted up, and it shall be brought low;
<B>2,13</B> And upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan;
<B>2,14</B> And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up;
<B>2,15</B> And upon every lofty tower, and upon every fortified wall;
<B>2,16</B> And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all delightful imagery.
<B>2,17</B> And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
<B>2,18</B> And the idols shall utterly pass away.
<B>2,19</B> And men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the glory of His majesty, when He ariseth to shake mightily the earth.
<B>2,20</B> In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made for themselves to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
<B>2,21</B> To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the crevices of the crags, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the glory of His majesty, when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.
<B>2,22</B> Cease ye from man, in whose nostrils is a breath; for how little is he to be accounted! <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>3,1</B> For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, every stay of bread, and every stay of water;
<B>3,2</B> The mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder;
<B>3,3</B> The captain of fifty, and the man of rank, and the counsellor, and the cunning charmer, and the skilful enchanter.
<B>3,4</B> And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
<B>3,5</B> And the people shall oppress one another, every man his fellow, and every man his neighbour; the child shall behave insolently against the aged, and the base against the honourable,
<B>3,6</B> For a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father: 'Thou hast a mantle, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand.'
<B>3,7</B> In that day shall he swear, saying: 'I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor a mantle; ye shall not make me ruler of a people.'
<B>3,8</B> For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of His glory.
<B>3,9</B> The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have wrought evil unto themselves.
<B>3,10</B> Say ye of the righteous, that it shall be well with him; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
<B>3,11</B> Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him; for the work of his hands shall be done to him.
<B>3,12</B> As for My people, a babe is their master, and women rule over them. O My people, they that lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>3,13</B> The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the peoples.
<B>3,14</B> The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of His people, and the princes thereof: 'It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses;
<B>3,15</B> What mean ye that ye crush My people, and grind the face of the poor?' saith the Lord, the GOD of hosts. <B>{S}</B>
<B>3,16</B> Moreover the LORD said: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;
<B>3,17</B> Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will lay bare their secret parts. <B>{S}</B>
<B>3,18</B> In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their anklets, and the fillets, and the crescents;
<B>3,19</B> the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils;
<B>3,20</B> the headtires, and the armlets, and the sashes, and the corselets, and the amulets;
<B>3,21</B> the rings, and the nose-jewels;
<B>3,22</B> the aprons, and the mantelets, and the cloaks, and the girdles;
<B>3,23</B> and the gauze robes, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the mantles.
<B>3,24</B> And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle rags; and instead of curled hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; branding instead of beauty.
<B>3,25</B> Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
<B>3,26</B> And her gates shall lament and mourn; and utterly bereft she shall sit upon the ground.
<B>4,1</B> And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying: 'We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name; take thou away our reproach.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>4,2</B> In that day shall the growth of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.
<B>4,3</B> And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written unto life in Jerusalem;
<B>4,4</B> when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of destruction.
<B>4,5</B> And the LORD will create over the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy.
<B>4,6</B> And there shall be a pavilion for a shadow in the day-time from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>5,1</B> Let me sing of my well-beloved, a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well-beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill;
<B>5,2</B> And he digged it, and cleared it of stones, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a vat therein; and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
<B>5,3</B> And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
<B>5,4</B> What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
<B>5,5</B> And now come, I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the fence thereof, and it shall be trodden down;
<B>5,6</B> And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned nor hoed, but there shall come up briers and thorns; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
<B>5,7</B> For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah the plant of His delight; and He looked for justice, but behold violence; for righteousness, but behold a cry. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>5,8</B> Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!
<B>5,9</B> In mine ears said the LORD of hosts: of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.
<B>5,10</B> For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah. <B>{S}</B>
<B>5,11</B> Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!
<B>5,12</B> And the harp and the psaltery, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are in their feasts; but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither have they considered the operation of His hands.
<B>5,13</B> Therefore My people are gone into captivity, for want of knowledge; and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.
<B>5,14</B> Therefore the nether-world hath enlarged her desire, and opened her mouth without measure; and down goeth their glory, and their tumult, and their uproar, and he that rejoiceth among them.
<B>5,15</B> And man is bowed down, and man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled;
<B>5,16</B> But the LORD of hosts is exalted through justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified through righteousness.
<B>5,17</B> Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat. <B>{S}</B>
<B>5,18</B> Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope,
<B>5,19</B> That say: 'Let Him make speed, let Him hasten His work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>5,20</B> Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that change darkness into light, and light into darkness; that change bitter into sweet, and sweet into bitter! <B>{S}</B>
<B>5,21</B> Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! <B>{S}</B>
<B>5,22</B> Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;
<B>5,23</B> That justify the wicked for a reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him! <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>5,24</B> Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the chaff is consumed in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of the LORD of hosts, and contemned the word of the Holy One of Israel.
<B>5,25</B> Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against His people, and He hath stretched forth His hand against them, and hath smitten them, and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.
<B>5,26</B> And He will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly;
<B>5,27</B> None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken;
<B>5,28</B> Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind;
<B>5,29</B> Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions, yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.
<B>5,30</B> And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea; and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and distress, and the light is darkened in the skies thereof. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>6,1</B> In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.
<B>6,2</B> Above Him stood the seraphim; each one had six wings: with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
<B>6,3</B> And one called unto another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory.
<B>6,4</B> And the posts of the door were moved at the voice of them that called, and the house was filled with smoke.
<B>6,5</B> Then said I: Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.
<B>6,6</B> Then flew unto me one of the seraphim, with a glowing stone in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;
<B>6,7</B> and he touched my mouth with it, and said: Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin expiated.
<B>6,8</B> And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said: 'Here am I; send me.'
<B>6,9</B> And He said: 'Go, and tell this people: hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
<B>6,10</B> Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they, seeing with their eyes, and hearing with their ears, and understanding with their heart, return, and be healed.'
<B>6,11</B> Then said I: 'Lord, how long?' And He answered: 'Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,
<B>6,12</B> And the LORD have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.
<B>6,13</B> And if there be yet a tenth in it, it shall again be eaten up; as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they cast their leaves, so the holy seed shall be the stock thereof.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>7,1</B> And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Aram, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it; but could not prevail against it.
<B>7,2</B> And it was told the house of David, saying: 'Aram is confederate with Ephraim.' And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are moved with the wind. <B>{S}</B>
<B>7,3</B> Then said the LORD unto Isaiah: 'Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fullers' field;
<B>7,4</B> and say unto him: Keep calm, and be quiet; fear not, neither let thy heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram, and of the son of Remaliah.
<B>7,5</B> Because Aram hath counselled evil against thee, Ephraim also, and the son of Remaliah, saying:
<B>7,6</B> Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel; <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>7,7</B> thus saith the Lord GOD: It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
<B>7,8</B> For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people;
<B>7,9</B> And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not have faith, surely ye shall not be established.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>7,10</B> And the LORD spoke again unto Ahaz, saying:
<B>7,11</B> 'Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God: ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.'
<B>7,12</B> But Ahaz said: 'I will not ask, neither will I try the LORD.'
<B>7,13</B> And he said: 'Hear ye now, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to weary men, that ye will weary my God also?
<B>7,14</B> Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: behold, the young woman shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
<B>7,15</B> Curd and honey shall he eat, when he knoweth to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
<B>7,16</B> Yea, before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou hast a horror of shall be forsaken.
<B>7,17</B> The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>7,18</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
<B>7,19</B> And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the rugged valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all brambles.
<B>7,20</B> In that day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also sweep away the beard. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>7,21</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall rear a young cow, and two sheep;
<B>7,22</B> and it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give, he shall eat curd; for curd and honey shall every one eat that is left in the midst of the land. <B>{S}</B>
<B>7,23</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, shall even be for briers and thorns.
<B>7,24</B> With arrows and with bow shall one come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
<B>7,25</B> And all the hills that were digged with the mattock, thou shalt not come thither for fear of briers and thorns, but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>8,1</B> And the LORD said unto me: 'Take thee a great tablet, and write upon it in common script: The spoil speedeth, the prey hasteth;
<B>8,2</B> and I will take unto Me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.'
<B>8,3</B> And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. <B>{S}</B> Then said the LORD unto me: 'Call his name Maher-shalal-hashbaz.
<B>8,4</B> For before the child shall have knowledge to cry: My father, and: My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>8,5</B> And the LORD spoke unto me yet again, saying:
<B>8,6</B> Forasmuch as this people hath refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoiceth with Rezin and Remaliah's son;
<B>8,7</B> Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the River, mighty and many, even the king of Assyria and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks;
<B>8,8</B> And he shall sweep through Judah overflowing as he passeth through he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel. <B>{S}</B>
<B>8,9</B> Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.
<B>8,10</B> Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for God is with us. <B>{S}</B>
<B>8,11</B> For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, admonishing me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying:
<B>8,12</B> 'Say ye not: A conspiracy, concerning all whereof this people do say: A conspiracy; neither fear ye their fear, nor account it dreadful.
<B>8,13</B> The LORD of hosts, Him shall ye sanctify; and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.
<B>8,14</B> And He shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<B>8,15</B> And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>8,16</B> 'Bind up the testimony, seal the instruction among My disciples.'
<B>8,17</B> And I will wait for the LORD, that hideth His face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for Him.
<B>8,18</B> Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me shall be for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion. <B>{S}</B>
<B>8,19</B> And when they shall say unto you: 'Seek unto the ghosts and the familiar spirits, that chirp and that mutter; should not a people seek unto their God? on behalf of the living unto the dead
<B>8,20</B> for instruction and for testimony?'--Surely they will speak according to this word, wherein there is no light.--
<B>8,21</B> And they shall pass this way that are sore bestead and hungry; and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their God, and, whether they turn their faces upward,
<B>8,22</B> or look unto the earth, behold distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish, and outspread thick darkness.
<B>8,23</B> For is there no gloom to her that was stedfast? Now the former hath lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but the latter hath dealt a more grievous blow by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, in the district of the nations.
<B>9,1</B> The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.
<B>9,2</B> Thou hast multiplied the nation, Thou hast increased their joy; they joy before Thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
<B>9,3</B> For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, Thou hast broken as in the day of Midian.
<B>9,4</B> For every boot stamped with fierceness, and every cloak rolled in blood, shall even be for burning, for fuel of fire.
<B>9,5</B> For a child is born unto us, a son is given unto us; and the government is upon his shoulder; and his name is called Pele-joez-el-gibbor-Abi-ad-sar-shalom;
<B>9,6</B> That the government may be increased, and of peace there be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it through justice and through righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts doth perform this. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>9,7</B> The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.
<B>9,8</B> And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and in arrogancy of heart:
<B>9,9</B> 'The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but cedars will we put in their place.'
<B>9,10</B> Therefore the LORD doth set upon high the adversaries of Rezin against him, and spur his enemies;
<B>9,11</B> The Arameans on the east, and the Philistines on the west; and they devour Israel with open mouth. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.
<B>9,12</B> Yet the people turneth not unto Him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts. <B>{S}</B>
<B>9,13</B> Therefore the LORD doth cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.
<B>9,14</B> The elder and the man of rank, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.
<B>9,15</B> For they that lead this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.
<B>9,16</B> Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall He have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for every one is ungodly and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh wantonness. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.
<B>9,17</B> For wickedness burneth as the fire; it devoureth the briers and thorns; yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in thick clouds of smoke.
<B>9,18</B> Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land burnt up; the people also are as the fuel of fire; no man spareth his brother.
<B>9,19</B> And one snatcheth on the right hand, and is hungry; and he eateth on the left hand, and is not satisfied; they eat every man the flesh of his own arm:
<B>9,20</B> Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together are against Judah. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still. <B>{S}</B>
<B>10,1</B> Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers that write iniquity;
<B>10,2</B> To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right of the poor of My people, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!
<B>10,3</B> And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the ruin which shall come from far? To whom will ye flee for help? And where will ye leave your glory?
<B>10,4</B> They can do nought except crouch under the captives, and fall under the slain. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>10,5</B> O Asshur, the rod of Mine anger, in whose hand as a staff is Mine indignation!
<B>10,6</B> I do send him against an ungodly nation, and against the people of My wrath do I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.
<B>10,7</B> Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.
<B>10,8</B> For he saith: 'Are not my princes all of them kings?
<B>10,9</B> Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus?
<B>10,10</B> As my hand hath reached the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images did exceed them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
<B>10,11</B> Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>10,12</B> Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed His whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his haughty looks.
<B>10,13</B> For he hath said: by the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I am prudent; in that I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and have brought down as one mighty the inhabitants;
<B>10,14</B> And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the peoples; and as one gathereth eggs that are forsaken, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or that opened the mouth, or chirped.
<B>10,15</B> Should the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? Should the saw magnify itself against him that moveth it? as if a rod should move them that lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up him that is not wood. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>10,16</B> Therefore will the Lord, the LORD of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire.
<B>10,17</B> And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.
<B>10,18</B> And the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, he will consume both soul and body; and it shall be as when a sick man wasteth away.
<B>10,19</B> And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them down. <B>{S}</B>
<B>10,20</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and they that are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
<B>10,21</B> A remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto God the Mighty.
<B>10,22</B> For though thy people, O Israel, be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them shall return; an extermination is determined, overflowing with righteousness.
<B>10,23</B> For an extermination wholly determined shall the Lord, the GOD of hosts, make in the midst of all the earth. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>10,24</B> Therefore thus saith the Lord, the GOD of hosts: O My people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of Asshur, though he smite thee with the rod, and lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.
<B>10,25</B> For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall be accomplished, and Mine anger shall be to their destruction.
<B>10,26</B> And the LORD of hosts shall stir up against him a scourge, as in the slaughter of Midian at the Rock of Oreb; and as His rod was over the sea, so shall He lift it up after the manner of Egypt.
<B>10,27</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall depart from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed by reason of fatness.
<B>10,28</B> He is come to Aiath, he is passed through Migron; at Michmas he layeth up his baggage;
<B>10,29</B> They are gone over the pass; they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah trembleth; Gibeath-shaul is fled.
<B>10,30</B> Cry thou with a shrill voice, O daughter of Gallim! Hearken, O Laish! O thou poor Anathoth!
<B>10,31</B> Madmenah is in mad flight; the inhabitants of Gebim flee to cover.
<B>10,32</B> This very day shall he halt at Nob, shaking his hand at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>10,33</B> Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the boughs with terror; and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the lofty shall be laid low.
<B>10,34</B> And He shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one. <B>{S}</B>
<B>11,1</B> And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a twig shall grow forth out of his roots.
<B>11,2</B> And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD.
<B>11,3</B> And his delight shall be in the fear of the LORD; and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither decide after the hearing of his ears;
<B>11,4</B> But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the land; and he shall smite the land with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
<B>11,5</B> And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
<B>11,6</B> And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
<B>11,7</B> And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
<B>11,8</B> And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the basilisk's den.
<B>11,9</B> They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea. <B>{S}</B>
<B>11,10</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the root of Jesse, that standeth for an ensign of the peoples, unto him shall the nations seek; and his resting-place shall be glorious. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>11,11</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord will set His hand again the second time to recover the remnant of His people, that shall remain from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
<B>11,12</B> And He will set up an ensign for the nations, and will assemble the dispersed of Israel, and gather together the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
<B>11,13</B> The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and they that harass Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.
<B>11,14</B> And they shall fly down upon the shoulder of the Philistines on the west; together shall they spoil the children of the east; they shall put forth their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.
<B>11,15</B> And the LORD will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with His scorching wind will He shake His hand over the River, and will smite it into seven streams, and cause men to march over dry-shod.
<B>11,16</B> And there shall be a highway for the remnant of His people, that shall remain from Assyria, like as there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
<B>12,1</B> And in that day thou shalt say: 'I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD; for though Thou was angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, and Thou comfortest me.
<B>12,2</B> Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for GOD the LORD is my strength and song; and He is become my salvation.'
<B>12,3</B> Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.
<B>12,4</B> And in that day shall ye say: 'Give thanks unto the LORD, proclaim His name, declare His doings among the peoples, make mention that His name is exalted.
<B>12,5</B> Sing unto the LORD; for He hath done gloriously; this is made known in all the earth.
<B>12,6</B> Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>13,1</B> The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.
<B>13,2</B> Set ye up an ensign upon the high mountain, lift up the voice unto them, wave the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.
<B>13,3</B> I have commanded My consecrated ones, yea, I have called My mighty ones for mine anger, even My proudly exulting ones.
<B>13,4</B> Hark, a tumult in the mountains, like as of a great people! Hark, the uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! The LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.
<B>13,5</B> They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of His indignation, to destroy the whole earth. <B>{S}</B>
<B>13,6</B> Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; as destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
<B>13,7</B> Therefore shall all hands be slack, and every heart of man shall melt.
<B>13,8</B> And they shall be affrighted; pangs and throes shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman in travail; they shall look aghast one at another; their faces shall be faces of flame.
<B>13,9</B> Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel, and full of wrath and fierce anger; to make the earth a desolation, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it,
<B>13,10</B> For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
<B>13,11</B> And I will visit upon the world their evil, and upon the wicked their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the tyrants.
<B>13,12</B> I will make man more rare than fine gold, even man than the pure gold of Ophir.
<B>13,13</B> Therefore I will make the heavens to tremble, and the earth shall be shaken out of her place, for the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and for the day of His fierce anger.
<B>13,14</B> And it shall come to pass, that as the chased gazelle, and as sheep that no man gathereth, they shall turn every man to his own people, and shall flee every man to his own land.
<B>13,15</B> Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is caught shall fall by the sword.
<B>13,16</B> Their babes also shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.
<B>13,17</B> Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who shall not regard silver, and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.
<B>13,18</B> And their bows shall dash the young men in pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.
<B>13,19</B> And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans' pride, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
<B>13,20</B> It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation; neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
<B>13,21</B> But wild-cats shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of ferrets; and ostriches shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.
<B>13,22</B> And jackals shall howl in their castles, and wild-dogs in the pleasant palaces; and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.
<B>14,1</B> For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land; and the stranger shall join himself with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.
<B>14,2</B> And the peoples shall take them, and bring them to their place; and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and for handmaids; and they shall take them captive, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors. <B>{S}</B>
<B>14,3</B> And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy travail, and from thy trouble, and from the hard service wherein thou wast made to serve,
<B>14,4</B> that thou shalt take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say: How hath the oppressor ceased! the exactress of gold ceased!
<B>14,5</B> The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, the sceptre of the rulers,
<B>14,6</B> That smote the peoples in wrath with an incessant stroke, that ruled the nations in anger, with a persecution that none restrained.
<B>14,7</B> The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet; they break forth into singing.
<B>14,8</B> Yea, the cypresses rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon: 'Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.'
<B>14,9</B> The nether-world from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming; the shades are stirred up for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; all the kings of the nations are raised up from their thrones.
<B>14,10</B> All they do answer and say unto thee: 'Art thou also become weak as we? Art thou become like unto us?
<B>14,11</B> Thy pomp is brought down to the nether-world, and the noise of thy psalteries; the maggot is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.'
<B>14,12</B> How art thou fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, that didst cast lots over the nations!
<B>14,13</B> And thou saidst in thy heart: 'I will ascend into heaven, above the stars of God will I exalt my throne, and I will sit upon the mount of meeting, in the uttermost parts of the north;
<B>14,14</B> I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.'
<B>14,15</B> Yet thou shalt be brought down to the nether-world, to the uttermost parts of the pit.
<B>14,16</B> They that saw thee do narrowly look upon thee, they gaze earnestly at thee: 'Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;
<B>14,17</B> That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?'
<B>14,18</B> All the kings of the nations, all of them, sleep in glory, every one in his own house.
<B>14,19</B> But thou art cast forth away from thy grave like an abhorred offshoot, in the raiment of the slain, that are thrust through with the sword, that go down to the pavement of the pit, as a carcass trodden under foot.
<B>14,20</B> Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people; the seed of evil-doers shall not be named for ever.
<B>14,21</B> Prepare ye slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they rise not up, and possess the earth, and fill the face of the world with cities.
<B>14,22</B> And I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and offshoot and offspring, saith the LORD.
<B>14,23</B> I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water; and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts. <B>{S}</B>
<B>14,24</B> The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying: Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand,
<B>14,25</B> That I will break Asshur in My land, and upon My mountains tread him under foot; then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulder.
<B>14,26</B> This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.
<B>14,27</B> For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? And His hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back? <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>14,28</B> In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.
<B>14,29</B> Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of thee, because the rod that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a basilisk, and his fruit shall be a flying serpent.
<B>14,30</B> And the first-born of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will kill thy root with famine, and thy remnant shall be slain.
<B>14,31</B> Howl, O gate; cry, O city; melt away, O Philistia, all of thee; for there cometh a smoke out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.
<B>14,32</B> What then shall one answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and in her shall the afflicted of His people take refuge. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>15,1</B> The burden of Moab. For in the night that Ar of Moab is laid waste, he is brought to ruin; for in the night that Kir of Moab is laid waste, he is brought to ruin.
<B>15,2</B> He is gone up to Baith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep; upon Nebo, and upon Medeba, Moab howleth; on all their heads is baldness, every beard is shaven.
<B>15,3</B> In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; on their housetops, and in their broad places, every one howleth, weeping profusely.
<B>15,4</B> And Heshbon crieth out, and Elealeh; their voice is heard even unto Jahaz; therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul is faint within him.
<B>15,5</B> My heart crieth out for Moab; her fugitives reach unto Zoar, a heifer of three years old; for by the ascent of Luhith with weeping they go up; for in the way of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction.
<B>15,6</B> For the Waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; for the grass is withered away, the herbage faileth, there is no green thing.
<B>15,7</B> Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.
<B>15,8</B> For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim.
<B>15,9</B> For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more upon Dimon, a lion upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.
<B>16,1</B> Send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land from the crags that are toward the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
<B>16,2</B> For it shall be that, as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of Arnon.
<B>16,3</B> 'Give counsel, execute justice; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; betray not the fugitive.
<B>16,4</B> Let mine outcasts dwell with thee; as for Moab, be thou a covert to him from the face of the spoiler.' For the extortion is at an end, spoiling ceaseth, they that trampled down are consumed out of the land; <B>{S}</B>
<B>16,5</B> And a throne is established through mercy, and there sitteth thereon in truth, in the tent of David, one that judgeth, and seeketh justice, and is ready in righteousness.
<B>16,6</B> We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud; even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his arrogancy, his ill-founded boastings.
<B>16,7</B> Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab, every one shall wail; for the sweet cakes of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn, sorely stricken.
<B>16,8</B> For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah, whose choice plants did overcome the lords of nations; they reached even unto Jazer, they wandered into the wilderness; her branches were spread abroad, they passed over the sea.
<B>16,9</B> Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh; for upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest the battle shout is fallen.
<B>16,10</B> And gladness and joy are taken away out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting; no treader shall tread out wine in the presses; I have made the vintage shout to cease.
<B>16,11</B> Wherefore my heart moaneth like a harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-heres.
<B>16,12</B> And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab hath wearied himself upon the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail. <B>{S}</B>
<B>16,13</B> This is the word that the LORD spoke concerning Moab in time past.
<B>16,14</B> But now the LORD hath spoken, saying: 'Within three years, as the years of a hireling, and the glory of Moab shall wax contemptible for all his great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and without strength.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>17,1</B> The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.
<B>17,2</B> The cities of Aroer are forsaken; they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
<B>17,3</B> The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus; and the remnant of Aram shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>17,4</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.
<B>17,5</B> And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the standing corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; yea, it shall be as when one gleaneth ears in the valley of Rephaim.
<B>17,6</B> Yet there shall be left therein gleanings, as at the beating of an olive-tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the branches of the fruitful tree, saith the LORD, the God of Israel.
<B>17,7</B> In that day shall a man regard his Maker, and his eyes shall look to the Holy One of Israel.
<B>17,8</B> And he shall not regard the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall he look to that which his fingers have made, either the Asherim, or the sun-images. <B>{S}</B>
<B>17,9</B> In that day shall his strong cities be as the forsaken places, which were forsaken from before the children of Israel, after the manner of woods and lofty forests; and it shall be a desolation.
<B>17,10</B> For thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and thou hast not been mindful of the Rock of thy stronghold; therefore thou didst plant plants of pleasantness, and didst set it with slips of a stranger;
<B>17,11</B> In the day of thy planting thou didst make it to grow, and in the morning thou didst make thy seed to blossom--a heap of boughs in the day of grief and of desperate pain. <B>{S}</B>
<B>17,12</B> Ah, the uproar of many peoples, that roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!
<B>17,13</B> The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters; but He shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like the whirling dust before the storm.
<B>17,14</B> At eventide behold terror; and before the morning they are not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>18,1</B> Ah, land of the buzzing of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;
<B>18,2</B> That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters! Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation tall and of glossy skin, to a people terrible from their beginning onward; a nation that is sturdy and treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide!
<B>18,3</B> All ye inhabitants of the world, and ye dwellers on the earth, when an ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see ye; and when the horn is blown, hear ye. <B>{S}</B>
<B>18,4</B> For thus hath the LORD said unto me: I will hold Me still, and I will look on in My dwelling-place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
<B>18,5</B> For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the bud becometh a ripening grape, He will cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks, and the shoots will He take away and lop off.
<B>18,6</B> They shall be left together unto the ravenous birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth; and the ravenous birds shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them. <B>{S}</B>
<B>18,7</B> In that time shall a present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a people tall and of glossy skin, and from a people terrible from their beginning onward; a nation that is sturdy and treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>19,1</B> The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and cometh unto Egypt; and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at His presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt within it.
<B>19,2</B> And I will spur Egypt against Egypt; and they shall fight every one against his brother, and everyone against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.
<B>19,3</B> And the spirit of Egypt shall be made empty within it; and I will make void the counsel thereof; and they shall seek unto the idols, and to the whisperers, and to the ghosts, and to the familiar spirits.
<B>19,4</B> And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.
<B>19,5</B> And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be drained dry,
<B>19,6</B> And the rivers shall become foul; the streams of Egypt shall be minished and dried up; the reeds and flags shall wither.
<B>19,7</B> The mosses by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all that is sown by the Nile, shall become dry, be driven away, and be no more.
<B>19,8</B> The fishers also shall lament, and all they that cast angle into the Nile shall mourn, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.
<B>19,9</B> Moreover they that work in combed flax, and they that weave cotton, shall be ashamed.
<B>19,10</B> And her foundations shall be crushed, all they that make dams shall be grieved in soul.
<B>19,11</B> The princes of Zoan are utter fools; the wisest counsellors of Pharaoh are a senseless counsel; how can ye say unto Pharaoh: 'I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings'?
<B>19,12</B> Where are they, then, thy wise men? And let them tell thee now; and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed concerning Egypt.
<B>19,13</B> The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have caused Egypt to go astray, that are the corner-stone of her tribes.
<B>19,14</B> The LORD hath mingled within her a spirit of dizziness; and they have caused Egypt to stagger in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.
<B>19,15</B> Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do.
<B>19,16</B> In that day shall Egypt be like unto women; and it shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which He shaketh over it.
<B>19,17</B> And the land of Judah shall become a terror unto Egypt, whensoever one maketh mention thereof to it; it shall be afraid, because of the purpose of the LORD of hosts, which He purposeth against it. <B>{S}</B>
<B>19,18</B> In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called the city of destruction. <B>{S}</B>
<B>19,19</B> In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.
<B>19,20</B> And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and He will send them a saviour, and a defender, who will deliver them.
<B>19,21</B> And the LORD shall make Himself known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day; yea, they shall worship with sacrifice and offering, and shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and shall perform it.
<B>19,22</B> And the LORD will smite Egypt, smiting and healing; and they shall return unto the LORD, and He will be entreated of them, and will heal them. <B>{S}</B>
<B>19,23</B> In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians. <B>{S}</B>
<B>19,24</B> In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth;
<B>19,25</B> for that the LORD of hosts hath blessed him, saying: 'Blessed be Egypt My people and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel Mine inheritance.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>20,1</B> In the year that Tartan came into Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it;
<B>20,2</B> at that time the LORD spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying: 'Go, and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put thy shoe from off thy foot.' And he did so, walking naked and barefoot. <B>{S}</B>
<B>20,3</B> And the LORD said: 'Like as My servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot to be for three years a sign and a wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia,
<B>20,4</B> so shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt, and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
<B>20,5</B> And they shall be dismayed and ashamed, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
<B>20,6</B> And the inhabitant of this coast-land shall say in that day: Behold, such is our expectation, whither we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria; and how shall we escape?' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>21,1</B> The burden of the wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweeping on, it cometh from the wilderness, from a dreadful land.
<B>21,2</B> A grievous vision is declared unto me: 'The treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam! besiege, O Media! All the sighing thereof have I made to cease.'
<B>21,3</B> Therefore are my loins filled with convulsion; pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail; I am bent so that I cannot hear; I am affrighted so that I cannot see.
<B>21,4</B> My heart is bewildered, terror hath overwhelmed me; the twilight that I longed for hath been turned for me into trembling.
<B>21,5</B> They prepare the table, they light the lamps, they eat, they drink--'Rise up, ye princes, anoint the shield.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>21,6</B> For thus hath the Lord said unto me: Go, set a watchman; let him declare what he seeth!
<B>21,7</B> And when he seeth a troop, horsemen by pairs, a troop of asses, a troop of camels, he shall hearken diligently with much heed.
<B>21,8</B> And he cried as a lion: 'Upon the watch-tower, O Lord, I stand continually in the daytime, and I am set in my ward all the nights.'
<B>21,9</B> And, behold, there came a troop of men, horsemen by pairs. And he spoke and said: 'Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground.'
<B>21,10</B> O thou my threshing, and the winnowing of my floor, that which I have heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>21,11</B> The burden of Dumah. One calleth unto me out of Seir: 'Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?'
<B>21,12</B> The watchman said: 'The morning cometh, and also the night--if ye will inquire, inquire ye; return, come.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>21,13</B> The burden upon Arabia. In the thickets in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye caravans of Dedanites.
<B>21,14</B> Unto him that is thirsty bring ye water! The inhabitants of the land of Tema did meet the fugitive with his bread.
<B>21,15</B> For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war. <B>{S}</B>
<B>21,16</B> For thus hath the Lord said unto me: 'Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail;
<B>21,17</B> and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished; for the LORD, the God of Israel, hath spoken it.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>22,1</B> The burden concerning the Valley of Vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops,
<B>22,2</B> Thou that art full of uproar, a tumultuous city, a joyous town? Thy slain are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.
<B>22,3</B> All thy rulers are fled together, without the bow they are bound; all that are found of thee are bound together, they are fled afar off.
<B>22,4</B> Therefore said I: 'Look away from me, I will weep bitterly; strain not to comfort me, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.'
<B>22,5</B> For it is a day of trouble, and of trampling, and of perplexity, from the Lord, the GOD of hosts, in the Valley of Vision; Kir shouting, and Shoa at the mount.
<B>22,6</B> And Elam bore the quiver, with troops of men, even horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.
<B>22,7</B> And it came to pass, when thy choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate,
<B>22,8</B> And the covering of Judah was laid bare, that thou didst look in that day to the armour in the house of the forest.
<B>22,9</B> And ye saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many; and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.
<B>22,10</B> And ye numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and ye broke down the houses to fortify the wall;
<B>22,11</B> ye made also a basin between the two walls for the water of the old pool--but ye looked not unto Him that had done this, neither had ye respect unto Him that fashioned it long ago.
<B>22,12</B> And in that day did the Lord, the GOD of hosts, call to weeping, and to lamentation, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth;
<B>22,13</B> And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine--'Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die!'
<B>22,14</B> And the LORD of hosts revealed Himself in mine ears: Surely this iniquity shall not be expiated by you till ye die, saith the Lord, the GOD of hosts. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>22,15</B> Thus saith the Lord, the GOD of hosts: Go, get thee unto this steward, even unto Shebna, who is over the house:
<B>22,16</B> What hast thou here, and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out here a sepulchre, thou that hewest thee out a sepulchre on high, and gravest a habitation for thyself in the rock?
<B>22,17</B> Behold, the LORD will hurl thee up and down with a man's throw; yea, He will wind thee round and round;
<B>22,18</B> He will violently roll and toss thee like a ball into a large country; there shalt thou die, and there shall be the chariots of thy glory, thou shame of the lord's house.
<B>22,19</B> And I will thrust thee from thy post, and from thy station shalt thou be pulled down.
<B>22,20</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah;
<B>22,21</B> And I will clothe him with thy robe, and bind him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.
<B>22,22</B> And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; and he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.
<B>22,23</B> And I will fasten him as a peg in a sure place; and he shall be for a throne of honour to his father's house.
<B>22,24</B> And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of flagons.
<B>22,25</B> In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the peg that was fastened in a sure place give way; and it shall be hewn down, and fall, and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off; for the LORD hath spoken it. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>23,1</B> The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in; from the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.
<B>23,2</B> Be still, ye inhabitants of the coast-land; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.
<B>23,3</B> And on great waters the seed of Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue; and she was the mart of nations.
<B>23,4</B> Be thou ashamed, O Zidon; for the sea hath spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying: 'I have not travailed, nor brought forth, neither have I reared young men, nor brought up virgins.'
<B>23,5</B> When the report cometh to Egypt, they shall be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.
<B>23,6</B> Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the coast-land.
<B>23,7</B> Is this your joyous city, whose feet in antiquity, in ancient days, carried her afar off to sojourn?
<B>23,8</B> Who hath devised this against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth?
<B>23,9</B> The LORD of hosts hath devised it, to pollute the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth.
<B>23,10</B> Overflow thy land as the Nile, O daughter of Tarshish! there is no girdle any more.
<B>23,11</B> He hath stretched out His hand over the sea, He hath shaken the kingdoms; the LORD hath given commandment concerning Canaan, to destroy the strongholds thereof;
<B>23,12</B> And He said: 'Thou shalt no more rejoice.' O thou oppressed virgin daughter of Zidon, arise, pass over to Kittim; even there shalt thou have no rest.
<B>23,13</B> Behold, the land of the Chaldeans--this is the people that was not, when Asshur founded it for shipmen--they set up their towers, they overthrew the palaces thereof; it is made a ruin.
<B>23,14</B> Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste. <B>{S}</B>
<B>23,15</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king; after the end of seventy years it shall fare with Tyre as in the song of the harlot:
<B>23,16</B> Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot long forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.
<B>23,17</B> And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will remember Tyre, and she shall return to her hire, and shall have commerce with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.
<B>23,18</B> And her gain and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD; it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her gain shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to eat their fill, and for stately clothing. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>24,1</B> Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.
<B>24,2</B> And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.
<B>24,3</B> The earth shall be utterly emptied, and clean despoiled; for the LORD hath spoken this word.
<B>24,4</B> The earth fainteth and fadeth away, the world faileth and fadeth away, the lofty people of the earth do fail.
<B>24,5</B> The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statute, broken the everlasting covenant.
<B>24,6</B> Therefore hath a curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are found guilty; therefore the inhabitants of the earth waste away, and men are left few.
<B>24,7</B> The new wine faileth, the vine fadeth; all the merry-hearted do sigh.
<B>24,8</B> The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.
<B>24,9</B> They drink not wine with a song; strong drink is bitter to them that drink it.
<B>24,10</B> Broken down is the city of wasteness; every house is shut up, that none may come in.
<B>24,11</B> There is a crying in the streets amidst the wine; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.
<B>24,12</B> In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten unto ruin.
<B>24,13</B> For thus shall it be in the midst of the earth, among the peoples, as at the beating of an olive-tree, as at the gleanings when the vintage is done.
<B>24,14</B> Those yonder lift up their voice, they sing for joy; for the majesty of the LORD they shout from the sea:
<B>24,15</B> 'Therefore glorify ye the LORD in the regions of light, even the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>24,16</B> From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs: 'Glory to the righteous.' But I say: I waste away, I waste away, woe is me! The treacherous deal treacherously; yea, the treacherous deal very treacherously.
<B>24,17</B> Terror, and the pit, and the trap, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.
<B>24,18</B> And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the terror shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the trap; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth do shake;
<B>24,19</B> The earth is broken, broken down, the earth is crumbled in pieces, the earth trembleth and tottereth;
<B>24,20</B> The earth reeleth to and fro like a drunken man, and swayeth to and fro as a lodge; and the transgression thereof is heavy upon it, and it shall fall, and not rise again. <B>{S}</B>
<B>24,21</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD will punish the host of the high heaven on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.
<B>24,22</B> And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the dungeon, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be punished.
<B>24,23</B> Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for the LORD of hosts will reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before His elders shall be Glory. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>25,1</B> O LORD, Thou art my God, I will exalt Thee, I will praise Thy name, for Thou hast done wonderful things; even counsels of old, in faithfulness and truth.
<B>25,2</B> For Thou hast made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin; a castle of strangers to be no city, it shall never be built.
<B>25,3</B> Therefore shall the strong people glorify Thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear Thee.
<B>25,4</B> For Thou hast been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat; for the blast of the terrible ones was as a storm against the wall.
<B>25,5</B> As the heat in a dry place, Thou didst subdue the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the terrible ones was brought low. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>25,6</B> And in this mountain will the LORD of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
<B>25,7</B> And He will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that is cast over all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.
<B>25,8</B> He will swallow up death for ever; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of His people will He take away from off all the earth; for the LORD hath spoken it. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>25,9</B> And it shall be said in that day: 'Lo, this is our God, for whom we waited, that He might save us; this is the LORD, for whom we waited, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.'
<B>25,10</B> For in this mountain will the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down in his place, even as straw is trodden down in the dunghill.
<B>25,11</B> And when he shall spread forth his hands in the midst thereof, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim, his pride shall be brought down together with the cunning of his hands.
<B>25,12</B> And the high fortress of thy walls will He bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust. <B>{S}</B>
<B>26,1</B> In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; walls and bulwarks doth He appoint for salvation.
<B>26,2</B> Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation that keepeth faithfulness may enter in.
<B>26,3</B> The mind stayed on Thee Thou keepest in perfect peace; because it trusteth in Thee.
<B>26,4</B> Trust ye in the LORD for ever, for the LORD is GOD, an everlasting Rock.
<B>26,5</B> For He hath brought down them that dwell on high, the lofty city, laying it low, laying it low even to the ground, bringing it even to the dust.
<B>26,6</B> The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.
<B>26,7</B> The way of the just is straight; Thou, Most Upright, makest plain the path of the just.
<B>26,8</B> Yea, in the way of Thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for Thee; to Thy name and to Thy memorial is the desire of our soul.
<B>26,9</B> With my soul have I desired Thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me have I sought Thee earnestly; for when Thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
<B>26,10</B> Let favour be shown to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>26,11</B> LORD, Thy hand was lifted up, yet they see not; they shall see with shame Thy zeal for the people; yea, fire shall devour Thine adversaries. <B>{S}</B>
<B>26,12</B> LORD, Thou wilt establish peace for us; for Thou hast indeed wrought all our works for us. <B>{S}</B>
<B>26,13</B> O LORD our God, other lords beside Thee have had dominion over us; but by Thee only do we make mention of Thy name.
<B>26,14</B> The dead live not, the shades rise not; to that end hast Thou punished and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.
<B>26,15</B> Thou hast gotten Thee honour with the nations, O LORD, yea, exceeding great honour with the nations; Thou art honoured unto the farthest ends of the earth. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>26,16</B> LORD, in trouble have they sought Thee, silently they poured out a prayer when Thy chastening was upon them.
<B>26,17</B> Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been at Thy presence, O LORD.
<B>26,18</B> We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the land; neither are the inhabitants of the world come to life.
<B>26,19</B> Thy dead shall live, my dead bodies shall arise--awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust--for Thy dew is as the dew of light, and the earth shall bring to life the shades. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>26,20</B> Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.
<B>26,21</B> For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of His place to visit upon the inhabitants of the earth their iniquity; the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>27,1</B> In that day the LORD with His sore and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the slant serpent, and leviathan the tortuous serpent; and He will slay the dragon that is in the sea. <B>{S}</B>
<B>27,2</B> In that day sing ye of her: 'A vineyard of foaming wine!'
<B>27,3</B> I the LORD do guard it, I water it every moment; lest Mine anger visit it, I guard it night and day.
<B>27,4</B> Fury is not in Me; would that I were as the briers and thorns in flame! I would with one step burn it altogether.
<B>27,5</B> Or else let him take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; yea, let him make peace with Me.
<B>27,6</B> In days to come shall Jacob take root, Israel shall blossom and bud; and the face of the world shall be filled with fruitage. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>27,7</B> Hath He smitten him as He smote those that smote him? Or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by Him?
<B>27,8</B> In full measure, when Thou sendest her away, Thou dost contend with her; He hath removed her with His rough blast in the day of the east wind.
<B>27,9</B> Therefore by this shall the iniquity of Jacob be expiated, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherim and the sun-images shall rise no more.
<B>27,10</B> For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation abandoned and forsaken, like the wilderness; there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.
<B>27,11</B> When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come, and set them on fire; for it is a people of no understanding; therefore He that made them will not have compassion upon them, and He that formed them will not be gracious unto them. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>27,12</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD will beat off [His fruit] from the flood of the River unto the Brook of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>27,13</B> And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great horn shall be blown; and they shall come that were lost in the land of Assyria, and they that were dispersed in the land of Egypt; and they shall worship the LORD in the holy mountain at Jerusalem. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>28,1</B> Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley of them that are smitten down with wine!
<B>28,2</B> Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, as a storm of hail, a tempest of destruction, as a storm of mighty waters overflowing, that casteth down to the earth with violence.
<B>28,3</B> The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under foot;
<B>28,4</B> And the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be as the first-ripe fig before the summer, which when one looketh upon it, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up. <B>{S}</B>
<B>28,5</B> In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of His people;
<B>28,6</B> And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn back the battle at the gate. <B>{S}</B>
<B>28,7</B> But these also reel through wine, and stagger through strong drink; the priest and the prophet reel through strong drink, they are confused because of wine, they stagger because of strong drink; they reel in vision, they totter in judgment.
<B>28,8</B> For all tables are full of filthy vomit, and no place is clean. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>28,9</B> Whom shall one teach knowledge? And whom shall one make to understand the message? Them that are weaned from the milk, them that are drawn from the breasts?
<B>28,10</B> For it is precept by precept, precept by precept, line by line, line by line; here a little, there a little.
<B>28,11</B> For with stammering lips and with a strange tongue shall it be spoken to this people;
<B>28,12</B> To whom it was said: 'This is the rest, give ye rest to the weary; and this is the refreshing'; yet they would not hear.
<B>28,13</B> And so the word of the LORD is unto them precept by precept, precept by precept, line by line, line by line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>28,14</B> Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scoffers, the ballad-mongers of this people which is in Jerusalem:
<B>28,15</B> Because ye have said: 'We have made a covenant with death, and with the nether-world are we at agreement; when the scouring scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and in falsehood have we hid ourselves'; <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>28,16</B> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a costly corner-stone of sure foundation; he that believeth shall not make haste.
<B>28,17</B> And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place. <B>{S}</B>
<B>28,18</B> And your covenant with death shall be disannulled and your agreement with the nether-world shall not stand; when the scouring scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it,
<B>28,19</B> As often as it passeth through, it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass through, by day and by night; and it shall be sheer terror to understand the message.
<B>28,20</B> For the bed is too short for a man to stretch himself; and the covering too narrow when he gathereth himself up.
<B>28,21</B> For the LORD will rise up as in mount Perazim, He will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon; that He may do His work, strange is His work, and bring to pass His act, strange is His act.
<B>28,22</B> Now therefore be ye not scoffers, lest your bands be made strong; for an extermination wholly determined have I heard from the Lord, the GOD of hosts, upon the whole land. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>28,23</B> Give ye ear, and hear my voice; attend, and hear my speech.
<B>28,24</B> Is the plowman never done with plowing to sow, with the opening and harrowing of his ground?
<B>28,25</B> When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the black cummin, and scatter the cummin, and put in the wheat in rows and the barley in the appointed place and the spelt in the border thereof?
<B>28,26</B> For He doth instruct him aright; his God doth teach him.
<B>28,27</B> For the black cummin is not threshed with a threshing-sledge, neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the black cummin is beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.
<B>28,28</B> Is bread corn crushed? Nay, he will not ever be threshing it; and though the roller of his wagon and its sharp edges move noisily, he doth not crush it.
<B>28,29</B> This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts: Wonderful is His counsel, and great His wisdom. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>29,1</B> Ah, Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add ye year to year, let the feasts come round!
<B>29,2</B> Then will I distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and moaning; and she shall be unto Me as a hearth of God.
<B>29,3</B> And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mound, and I will raise siege works against thee.
<B>29,4</B> And brought down thou shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust; and thy voice shall be as of a ghost out of the ground, and thy speech shall chirp out of the dust.
<B>29,5</B> But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away; yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly--
<B>29,6</B> There shall be a visitation from the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.
<B>29,7</B> And the multitude of all the nations that war against Ariel, even all that war against her, and the bulwarks about her, and they that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.
<B>29,8</B> And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth, but he awaketh, and his soul is empty; or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh, but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite--so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>29,9</B> Stupefy yourselves, and be stupid! Blind yourselves, and be blind! ye that are drunken, but not with wine, that stagger, but not with strong drink.
<B>29,10</B> For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the prophets, and your heads, the seers, hath He covered.
<B>29,11</B> And the vision of all this is become unto you as the words of a writing that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying: 'Read this, I pray thee'; and he saith: 'I cannot, for it is sealed';
<B>29,12</B> and the writing is delivered to him that is not learned, saying: 'Read this, I pray thee'; and he saith: 'I am not learned.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>29,13</B> And the Lord said: Forasmuch as this people draw near, and with their mouth and with their lips do honour Me, but have removed their heart far from Me, and their fear of Me is a commandment of men learned by rote;
<B>29,14</B> Therefore, behold, I will again do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the prudence of their prudent men shall be hid. <B>{S}</B>
<B>29,15</B> Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say: 'Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?'
<B>29,16</B> O your perversity! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it: 'He made me not'; or the thing framed say of him that framed it: 'He hath no understanding?'
<B>29,17</B> Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
<B>29,18</B> And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of a book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.
<B>29,19</B> The humble also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the neediest among men shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.
<B>29,20</B> For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off;
<B>29,21</B> That make a man an offender by words, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>29,22</B> Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale;
<B>29,23</B> When he seeth his children, the work of My hands, in the midst of him, that they sanctify My name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.
<B>29,24</B> They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmur shall learn instruction. <B>{S}</B>
<B>30,1</B> Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of Me; and that form projects, but not of My spirit, that they may add sin to sin;
<B>30,2</B> That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at My mouth; to take refuge in the stronghold of Pharaoh, and to take shelter in the shadow of Egypt!
<B>30,3</B> Therefore shall the stronghold of Pharaoh turn to your shame, and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your confusion.
<B>30,4</B> For his princes are at Zoan, and his ambassadors are come to Hanes.
<B>30,5</B> They shall all be ashamed of a people that cannot profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach. <B>{S}</B>
<B>30,6</B> The burden of the beasts of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the lioness and the lion, the viper and flying serpent, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the humps of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.
<B>30,7</B> For Egypt helpeth in vain, and to no purpose; therefore have I called her arrogancy that sitteth still.
<B>30,8</B> Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever.
<B>30,9</B> For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children that refuse to hear the teaching of the LORD;
<B>30,10</B> That say to the seers: 'See not,' and to the prophets: 'Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy delusions;
<B>30,11</B> Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>30,12</B> Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel: because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon;
<B>30,13</B> Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.
<B>30,14</B> And He shall break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing; so that there shall not be found among the pieces thereof a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water out of the cistern. <B>{S}</B>
<B>30,15</B> For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel: in sitting still and rest shall ye be saved, in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength; and ye would not.
<B>30,16</B> But ye said: 'No, for we will flee upon horses'; therefore shall ye flee; and: 'We will ride upon the swift'; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
<B>30,17</B> One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one, at the rebuke of five shall ye flee; till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.
<B>30,18</B> And therefore will the LORD wait, that He may be gracious unto you, and therefore will He be exalted, that He may have compassion upon you; for the LORD is a God of justice, happy are all they that wait for Him. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>30,19</B> For, O people that dwellest in Zion at Jerusalem, thou shalt weep no more; He will surely be gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry, when He shall hear, He will answer thee.
<B>30,20</B> And though the Lord give you sparing bread and scant water, yet shall not thy Teacher hide Himself any more, but thine eyes shall see thy Teacher;
<B>30,21</B> And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying: 'This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.'
<B>30,22</B> And ye shall defile thy graven images overlaid with silver, and thy molten images covered with gold; thou shalt put them far away as one unclean; thou shalt say unto it: 'Get thee hence.'
<B>30,23</B> And He will give the rain for thy seed, wherewith thou sowest the ground, and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous; in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.
<B>30,24</B> The oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savoury provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
<B>30,25</B> And there shall be upon every lofty mountain, and upon every high hill streams and watercourses, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
<B>30,26</B> Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of the seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the bruise of His people, and healeth the stroke of their wound. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>30,27</B> Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, with His anger burning, and in thick uplifting of smoke; His lips are full of indignation, and His tongue is as a devouring fire;
<B>30,28</B> And His breath is as an overflowing stream, that divideth even unto the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction; and a bridle that causeth to err shall be in the jaws of the peoples.
<B>30,29</B> Ye shall have a song as in the night when a feast is hallowed; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with the pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.
<B>30,30</B> And the LORD will cause His glorious voice to be heard, and will show the lighting down of His arm, with furious anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a bursting of clouds, and a storm of rain, and hailstones.
<B>30,31</B> For through the voice of the LORD shall Asshur be dismayed, the rod with which He smote.
<B>30,32</B> And in every place where the appointed staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps; and in battles of wielding will He fight with them.
<B>30,33</B> For a hearth is ordered of old; yea, for the king it is prepared, deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>31,1</B> Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many, and in horsemen, because they are exceeding mighty; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!
<B>31,2</B> Yet He also is wise, and bringeth evil, and doth not call back His words; but will arise against the house of the evil-doers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.
<B>31,3</B> Now the Egyptians are men, and not God, and their horses flesh, and not spirit; so when the LORD shall stretch out His hand, both he that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is helped shall fall, and they all shall perish together. <B>{S}</B>
<B>31,4</B> For thus saith the LORD unto me: Like as the lion, or the young lion, growling over his prey, though a multitude of shepherds be called forth against him, will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them; so will the LORD of hosts come down to fight upon mount Zion, and upon the hill thereof.
<B>31,5</B> As birds hovering, so will the LORD of hosts protect Jerusalem; He will deliver it as He protecteth it, He will rescue it as He passeth over.
<B>31,6</B> Turn ye unto Him against whom ye have deeply rebelled, O children of Israel.
<B>31,7</B> For in that day they shall cast away every man his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.
<B>31,8</B> Then shall Asshur fall with the sword, not of man, and the sword, not of men, shall devour him; and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become tributary.
<B>31,9</B> And his rock shall pass away by reason of terror, and his princes shall be dismayed at the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>32,1</B> Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and as for princes, they shall rule in justice.
<B>32,2</B> And a man shall be as in a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as by the watercourses in a dry place, as in the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
<B>32,3</B> And the eyes of them that see shall not be closed, and the ears of them that hear shall attend.
<B>32,4</B> The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
<B>32,5</B> The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be noble.
<B>32,6</B> For the vile person will speak villainy, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise ungodliness, and to utter wickedness against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
<B>32,7</B> The instruments also of the churl are evil; he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, and the needy when he speaketh right.
<B>32,8</B> But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand. <B>{S}</B>
<B>32,9</B> Rise up, ye women that are at ease, and hear my voice; ye confident daughters, give ear unto my speech.
<B>32,10</B> After a year and days shall ye be troubled, ye confident women; for the vintage shall fail, the ingathering shall not come.
<B>32,11</B> Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye confident ones; strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins,
<B>32,12</B> Smiting upon the breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine;
<B>32,13</B> For the land of my people whereon thorns and briers come up; yea, for all the houses of joy and the joyous city.
<B>32,14</B> For the palace shall be forsaken; the city with its stir shall be deserted; the mound and the tower shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
<B>32,15</B> Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.
<B>32,16</B> Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field.
<B>32,17</B> And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and confidence for ever.
<B>32,18</B> And my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation, and in secure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.
<B>32,19</B> And it shall hail, in the downfall of the forest; but the city shall descend into the valley.
<B>32,20</B> Happy are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth freely the feet of the ox and the ass. <B>{S}</B>
<B>33,1</B> Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou art weary with dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee. <B>{S}</B>
<B>33,2</B> O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for Thee; be Thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.
<B>33,3</B> At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of Thyself the nations are scattered.
<B>33,4</B> And your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathereth; as locusts leap do they leap upon it.
<B>33,5</B> The LORD is exalted, for He dwelleth on high; He hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
<B>33,6</B> And the stability of thy times shall be a hoard of salvation--wisdom and knowledge, and the fear of the LORD which is His treasure. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>33,7</B> Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.
<B>33,8</B> The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth; he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man.
<B>33,9</B> The land mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is ashamed, it withereth; Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel are clean bare. <B>{S}</B>
<B>33,10</B> Now will I arise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift Myself up.
<B>33,11</B> Ye conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble; your breath is a fire that shall devour you.
<B>33,12</B> And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime; as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>33,13</B> Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge My might.
<B>33,14</B> The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath seized the ungodly: 'Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?'
<B>33,15</B> He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil;
<B>33,16</B> He shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given, his waters shall be sure.
<B>33,17</B> Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty; they shall behold a land stretching afar.
<B>33,18</B> Thy heart shall muse on the terror: 'Where is he that counted, where is he that weighed? Where is he that counted the towers?'
<B>33,19</B> Thou shalt not see the fierce people; a people of a deep speech that thou canst not perceive, of a stammering tongue that thou canst not understand.
<B>33,20</B> Look upon Zion, the city of our solemn gatherings; thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a peaceful habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
<B>33,21</B> But there the LORD will be with us in majesty, in a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.
<B>33,22</B> For the LORD is our Judge, the LORD is our Lawgiver, the LORD is our King; He will save us.
<B>33,23</B> Thy tacklings are loosed; they do not hold the stand of their mast, they do not spread the sail; then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.
<B>33,24</B> And the inhabitant shall not say: 'I am sick'; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. <B>{S}</B>
<B>34,1</B> Come near, ye nations, to hear, and attend, ye peoples; let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof, the world, and all things that come forth of it.
<B>34,2</B> For the LORD hath indignation against all the nations, and fury against all their host; He hath utterly destroyed them, He hath delivered them to the slaughter.
<B>34,3</B> Their slain also shall be cast out, and the stench of their carcasses shall come up, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
<B>34,4</B> And all the host of heaven shall moulder away, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig-tree.
<B>34,5</B> For My sword hath drunk its fill in heaven; behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of My ban, to judgment.
<B>34,6</B> The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
<B>34,7</B> And the wild-oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
<B>34,8</B> For the LORD hath a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the controversy of Zion.
<B>34,9</B> And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
<B>34,10</B> It shall not be quenched night nor day, the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste: none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
<B>34,11</B> But the pelican and the bittern shall possess it, and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein; and He shall stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.
<B>34,12</B> As for her nobles, none shall be there to be called to the kingdom; and all her princes shall be nothing.
<B>34,13</B> And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be a habitation of wild-dogs, an enclosure for ostriches.
<B>34,14</B> And the wild-cats shall meet with the jackals, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall repose there, and shall find her a place of rest.
<B>34,15</B> There shall the arrowsnake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and brood under her shadow; yea, there shall the kites be gathered, every one with her mate.
<B>34,16</B> Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read; no one of these shall be missing, none shall want her mate; for My mouth it hath commanded, and the breath thereof it hath gathered them.
<B>34,17</B> And He hath cast the lot for them, and His hand hath divided it unto them by line; they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein. <B>{S}</B>
<B>35,1</B> The wilderness and the parched land shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
<B>35,2</B> It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice, even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon; they shall see the glory of the LORD, the excellency of our God. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>35,3</B> Strengthen ye the weak hands, and make firm the tottering knees.
<B>35,4</B> Say to them that are of a fearful heart: 'Be strong, fear not'; behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God He will come and save you.
<B>35,5</B> Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
<B>35,6</B> Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.
<B>35,7</B> And the parched land shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water; in the habitation of jackals herds shall lie down, it shall be an enclosure for reeds and rushes.
<B>35,8</B> And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called the way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those; the wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err therein.
<B>35,9</B> No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon, they shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there;
<B>35,10</B> And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. <B>{S}</B>
<B>36,1</B> Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
<B>36,2</B> And the king of Assyria sent Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers' field.
<B>36,3</B> Then came forth unto him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
<B>36,4</B> And Rab-shakeh said unto them: 'Say ye now to Hezekiah: Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
<B>36,5</B> I said: It is but vain words; for counsel and strength are for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?
<B>36,6</B> Behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.
<B>36,7</B> But if thou say unto me: We trust in the LORD our God; is not that He, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem: Ye shall worship before this altar?
<B>36,8</B> Now therefore, I pray thee, make a wager with my master, the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
<B>36,9</B> How then canst thou turn away the face of one captain, even of the least of my master's servants? yet thou puttest thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen!
<B>36,10</B> And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? The LORD said unto me: Go up against this land, and destroy it.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>36,11</B> Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rab-shakeh: 'Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Aramean language, for we understand it; and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.'
<B>36,12</B> But Rab-shakeh said: 'Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, to eat their own dung, and to drink their own water with you?'
<B>36,13</B> Then Rab-shakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said: 'Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
<B>36,14</B> Thus saith the king: Let not Hezekiah beguile you, for he will not be able to deliver you;
<B>36,15</B> neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying: The LORD will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
<B>36,16</B> Hearken not to Hezekiah; <B>{P}</B><BR><BR>for thus saith the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
<B>36,17</B> until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
<B>36,18</B> Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying: The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
<B>36,19</B> Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
<B>36,20</B> Who are they among all the gods of these countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'
<B>36,21</B> But they held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king's commandment was, saying: 'Answer him not.'
<B>36,22</B> Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh. <B>{S}</B>
<B>37,1</B> And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
<B>37,2</B> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
<B>37,3</B> And they said unto him: 'Thus saith Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of contumely; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
<B>37,4</B> It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to taunt the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD thy God hath heard; wherefore make prayer for the remnant that is left.'
<B>37,5</B> So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
<B>37,6</B> And Isaiah said unto them: 'Thus shall ye say to your master: Thus saith the LORD: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.
<B>37,7</B> Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return unto his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.'
<B>37,8</B> So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
<B>37,9</B> And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia: 'He is come out to fight against thee.' And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying:
<B>37,10</B> 'Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Let not thy God in whom thou trustest beguile thee, saying: Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
<B>37,11</B> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
<B>37,12</B> Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar?
<B>37,13</B> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?'
<B>37,14</B> And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<B>37,15</B> And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying:
<B>37,16</B> 'O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, that sittest upon the cherubim, Thou art the God, even Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made heaven and earth.
<B>37,17</B> Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open Thine eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to taunt the living God.
<B>37,18</B> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,
<B>37,19</B> and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
<B>37,20</B> Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art the LORD, even Thou only.'
<B>37,21</B> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying: 'Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,
<B>37,22</B> this is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
<B>37,23</B> Whom hast thou taunted and blasphemed? And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice? Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high, even against the Holy One of Israel!
<B>37,24</B> By thy servants hast thou taunted the Lord, and hast said: With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I have cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice cypress-trees thereof; and I have entered into his farthest height, the forest of his fruitful field.
<B>37,25</B> I have digged and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of Egypt.
<B>37,26</B> Hast thou not heard? Long ago I made it, in ancient times I fashioned it; now have I brought it to pass, yea, it is done; that fortified cities should be laid waste into ruinous heaps.
<B>37,27</B> Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as a field of corn before it is grown up.
<B>37,28</B> But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against Me.
<B>37,29</B> Because of thy raging against Me, and for that thine uproar is come up into Mine ears, therefore will I put My hook in thy nose, and My bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
<B>37,30</B> And this shall be the sign unto thee: ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
<B>37,31</B> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
<B>37,32</B> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that shall escape; the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall perform this. <B>{S}</B>
<B>37,33</B> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come unto this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast a mound against it.
<B>37,34</B> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come unto this city, saith the LORD.
<B>37,35</B> For I will defend this city to save it, for Mine own sake, and for My servant David's sake.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>37,36</B> And the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
<B>37,37</B> So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went, and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
<B>37,38</B> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sarezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. <B>{S}</B>
<B>38,1</B> In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him: 'Thus saith the LORD: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.'
<B>38,2</B> Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
<B>38,3</B> and said: 'Remember now, O LORD, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a whole heart, and have done that which is good in Thy sight.' And Hezekiah wept sore. <B>{S}</B>
<B>38,4</B> Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying:
<B>38,5</B> 'Go, and say to Hezekiah: Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.
<B>38,6</B> And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city.
<B>38,7</B> And this shall be the sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that He hath spoken:
<B>38,8</B> behold, I will cause the shadow of the dial, which is gone down on the sun-dial of Ahaz, to return backward ten degrees.' So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down. <B>{S}</B>
<B>38,9</B> The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness.
<B>38,10</B> I said: In the noontide of my days I shall go, even to the gates of the nether-world; I am deprived of the residue of my years.
<B>38,11</B> I said: I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD in the land of the living; I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
<B>38,12</B> My habitation is plucked up and carried away from me as a shepherd's tent; I have rolled up like a weaver my life; He will cut me off from the thrum; from day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me.
<B>38,13</B> The more I make myself like unto a lion until morning, the more it breaketh all my bones; from day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me.
<B>38,14</B> Like a swallow or a crane, so do I chatter, I do moan as a dove; mine eyes fail with looking upward. O LORD, I am oppressed, be Thou my surety.
<B>38,15</B> What shall I say? He hath both spoken unto me, and Himself hath done it; I shall go softly all my years for the bitterness of my soul.
<B>38,16</B> O Lord, by these things men live, and altogether therein is the life of my spirit; wherefore recover Thou me, and make me to live.
<B>38,17</B> Behold, for my peace I had great bitterness; but Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption; for Thou hast cast all my sins behind Thy back.
<B>38,18</B> For the nether-world cannot praise Thee, death cannot celebrate Thee; they that go down into the pit cannot hope for Thy truth.
<B>38,19</B> The living, the living, he shall praise Thee, as I do this day; the father to the children shall make known Thy truth.
<B>38,20</B> The LORD is ready to save me; therefore we will sing songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.
<B>38,21</B> And Isaiah said: 'Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.'
<B>38,22</B> And Hezekiah said. 'What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?' <B>{S}</B>
<B>39,1</B> At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.
<B>39,2</B> And Hezekiah was glad of them, and showed them his treasure-house, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures; there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not. <B>{S}</B>
<B>39,3</B> Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him: 'What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?' And Hezekiah said: 'They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.'
<B>39,4</B> Then said he: 'What have they seen in thy house?' And Hezekiah answered: 'All that is in my house have they seen; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.'
<B>39,5</B> Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah: 'Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
<B>39,6</B> Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.
<B>39,7</B> And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be officers in the palace of the king of Babylon.'
<B>39,8</B> Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah: 'Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken.' He said moreover: 'If but there shall be peace and truth in my days.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>40,1</B> Comfort ye, comfort ye My people, saith your God.
<B>40,2</B> Bid Jerusalem take heart, and proclaim unto her, that her time of service is accomplished, that her guilt is paid off; that she hath received of the LORD'S hand double for all her sins. <B>{S}</B>
<B>40,3</B> Hark! one calleth: 'Clear ye in the wilderness the way of the LORD, make plain in the desert a highway for our God.
<B>40,4</B> Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the rugged shall be made level, and the rough places a plain;
<B>40,5</B> And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>40,6</B> Hark! one saith: 'Proclaim!' And he saith: 'What shall I proclaim?' 'All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field;
<B>40,7</B> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; because the breath of the LORD bloweth upon it--surely the people is grass.
<B>40,8</B> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand for ever.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>40,9</B> O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up into the high mountain; O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah: 'Behold your God!'
<B>40,10</B> Behold, the Lord GOD will come as a Mighty One, and His arm will rule for Him; behold, His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.
<B>40,11</B> Even as a shepherd that feedeth his flock, that gathereth the lambs in his arm, and carrieth them in his bosom, and gently leadeth those that give suck. <B>{S}</B>
<B>40,12</B> Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
<B>40,13</B> Who hath meted out the spirit of the LORD? Or who was His counsellor that he might instruct Him?
<B>40,14</B> With whom took He counsel, and who instructed Him, and taught Him in the path of right, and taught Him knowledge, and made Him to know the way of discernment?
<B>40,15</B> Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance; behold the isles are as a mote in weight.
<B>40,16</B> And Lebanon is not sufficient fuel, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for burnt-offerings. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>40,17</B> All the nations are as nothing before Him; they are accounted by Him as things of nought, and vanity.
<B>40,18</B> To whom then will ye liken God? Or what likeness will ye compare unto Him?
<B>40,19</B> The image perchance, which the craftsman hath melted, and the goldsmith spread over with gold, the silversmith casting silver chains?
<B>40,20</B> A holm-oak is set apart, he chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning craftsman to set up an image, that shall not be moved. <B>{S}</B>
<B>40,21</B> Know ye not? hear ye not? Hath it not been told you from the beginning? Have ye not understood the foundations of the earth?
<B>40,22</B> It is He that sitteth above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in;
<B>40,23</B> That bringeth princes to nothing; He maketh the judges of the earth as a thing of nought.
<B>40,24</B> Scarce are they planted, scarce are they sown, scarce hath their stock taken root in the earth; when He bloweth upon them, they wither, and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble. <B>{S}</B>
<B>40,25</B> To whom then will ye liken Me, that I should be equal? saith the Holy One.
<B>40,26</B> Lift up your eyes on high, and see: who hath created these? He that bringeth out their host by number, He calleth them all by name; by the greatness of His might, and for that He is strong in power, not one faileth. <B>{S}</B>
<B>40,27</B> Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel: 'My way is hid from the LORD, and my right is passed over from my God'?
<B>40,28</B> Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? His discernment is past searching out.
<B>40,29</B> He giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might He increaseth strength.
<B>40,30</B> Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall;
<B>40,31</B> But they that wait for the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint. <B>{S}</B>
<B>41,1</B> Keep silence before Me, O islands, and let the peoples renew their strength; let them draw near, then let them speak; let us come near together to judgment.
<B>41,2</B> Who hath raised up one from the east, at whose steps victory attendeth? He giveth nations before him, and maketh him rule over kings; his sword maketh them as the dust, his bow as the driven stubble.
<B>41,3</B> He pursueth them, and passeth on safely; the way with his feet he treadeth not.
<B>41,4</B> Who hath wrought and done it? He that called the generations from the beginning. I, the LORD, who am the first, and with the last am the same.
<B>41,5</B> The isles saw, and feared; the ends of the earth trembled; they drew near, and came.
<B>41,6</B> They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his brother: 'Be of good courage.'
<B>41,7</B> So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smiteth the anvil, saying of the soldering: 'It is good'; and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved. <B>{S}</B>
<B>41,8</B> But thou, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham My friend;
<B>41,9</B> Thou whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the uttermost parts thereof, and said unto thee: 'Thou art My servant, I have chosen thee and not cast thee away';
<B>41,10</B> Fear thou not, for I am with thee, be not dismayed, for I am thy God; I strengthen thee, yea, I help thee; yea, I uphold thee with My victorious right hand.
<B>41,11</B> Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded; they that strove with thee shall be as nothing, and shall perish.
<B>41,12</B> Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee; they that warred against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.
<B>41,13</B> For I the LORD thy God hold thy right hand, who say unto thee: 'Fear not, I help thee.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>41,14</B> Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I help thee, saith the LORD, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
<B>41,15</B> Behold, I make thee a new threshing-sledge having sharp teeth; thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.
<B>41,16</B> Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them; and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, thou shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel. <B>{S}</B>
<B>41,17</B> The poor and needy seek water and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst; I the LORD will answer them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.
<B>41,18</B> I will open rivers on the high hills, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
<B>41,19</B> I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia-tree, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will set in the desert the cypress, the plane-tree, and the larch together;
<B>41,20</B> That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>41,21</B> Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your reasons, saith the King of Jacob.
<B>41,22</B> Let them bring them forth, and declare unto us the things that shall happen; the former things, what are they? Declare ye, that we may consider, and know the end of them; or announce to us things to come.
<B>41,23</B> Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods; yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.
<B>41,24</B> Behold, ye are nothing, and your work a thing of nought; an abomination is he that chooseth you. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>41,25</B> I have roused up one from the north, and he is come, from the rising of the sun one that calleth upon My name; and he shall come upon rulers as upon mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay.
<B>41,26</B> Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say that he is right? Yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that announceth, yea, there is none that heareth your utterances.
<B>41,27</B> A harbinger unto Zion will I give: 'Behold, behold them', and to Jerusalem a messenger of good tidings.
<B>41,28</B> And I look, but there is no man; even among them, but there is no counsellor, that, when I ask of them, can give an answer.
<B>41,29</B> Behold, all of them, their works are vanity and nought; their molten images are wind and confusion. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>42,1</B> Behold My servant, whom I uphold; Mine elect, in whom My soul delighteth; I have put My spirit upon him, he shall make the right to go forth to the nations.
<B>42,2</B> He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.
<B>42,3</B> A bruised reed shall he not break, and the dimly burning wick shall he not quench; he shall make the right to go forth according to the truth.
<B>42,4</B> He shall not fail nor be crushed, till he have set the right in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his teaching. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>42,5</B> Thus saith God the LORD, He that created the heavens, and stretched them forth, He that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it, He that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:
<B>42,6</B> I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and have taken hold of thy hand, and kept thee, and set thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the nations;
<B>42,7</B> To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house.
<B>42,8</B> I am the LORD, that is My name; and My glory will I not give to another, neither My praise to graven images.
<B>42,9</B> Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare; before they spring forth I tell you of them. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>42,10</B> Sing unto the LORD a new song, and His praise from the end of the earth; ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.
<B>42,11</B> Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of Sela exult, let them shout from the top of the mountains.
<B>42,12</B> Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare His praise in the islands.
<B>42,13</B> The LORD will go forth as a mighty man, He will stir up jealousy like a man of war; He will cry, yea, He will shout aloud, He will prove Himself mighty against His enemies. <B>{S}</B>
<B>42,14</B> I have long time held My peace, I have been still, and refrained Myself; now will I cry like a travailing woman, gasping and panting at once.
<B>42,15</B> I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.
<B>42,16</B> And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, in paths that they knew not will I lead them; I will make darkness light before them, and rugged places plain. These things will I do, and I will not leave them undone.
<B>42,17</B> They shall be turned back, greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say unto molten images: 'Ye are our gods.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>42,18</B> Hear, ye deaf, and look, ye blind, that ye may see.
<B>42,19</B> Who is blind, but My servant? Or deaf, as My messenger that I send? Who is blind as he that is wholehearted, and blind as the LORD'S servant?
<B>42,20</B> Seeing many things, thou observest not; opening the ears, he heareth not.
<B>42,21</B> The LORD was pleased, for His righteousness' sake, to make the teaching great and glorious.
<B>42,22</B> But this is a people robbed and spoiled, they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses; they are for a prey, and none delivereth, for a spoil, and none saith: 'Restore.'
<B>42,23</B> Who among you will give ear to this? Who will hearken and hear for the time to come?
<B>42,24</B> Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? Did not the LORD? He against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient unto His law.
<B>42,25</B> Therefore He poured upon him the fury of His anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not, and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.
<B>43,1</B> But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and He that formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art Mine.
<B>43,2</B> When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
<B>43,3</B> For I am the LORD thy God, The Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour; I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.
<B>43,4</B> Since thou art precious in My sight, and honourable, and I have loved thee; therefore will I give men for thee, and peoples for thy life.
<B>43,5</B> Fear not, for I am with thee; I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;
<B>43,6</B> I will say to the north: 'Give up,' and to the south: 'Keep not back, bring My sons from far, and My daughters from the end of the earth;
<B>43,7</B> Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him.'
<B>43,8</B> The blind people that have eyes shall be brought forth, and the deaf that have ears.
<B>43,9</B> All the nations are gathered together, and the peoples are assembled; who among them can declare this, and announce to us former things? Let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified; and let them hear, and say: 'It is truth.'
<B>43,10</B> Ye are My witnesses, saith the LORD, and My servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe Me, and understand that I am He; before Me there was no God formed, neither shall any be after Me. <B>{S}</B>
<B>43,11</B> I, even I, am the LORD; and beside Me there is no saviour.
<B>43,12</B> I have declared, and I have saved, and I have announced, and there was no strange god among you; therefore ye are My witnesses, saith the LORD, and I am God.
<B>43,13</B> Yea, since the day was I am He, and there is none that can deliver out of My hand; I will work, and who can reverse it? <B>{S}</B>
<B>43,14</B> Thus saith the LORD, your Redeemer, The Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring down all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their shouting.
<B>43,15</B> I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King. <B>{S}</B>
<B>43,16</B> Thus saith the LORD, who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;
<B>43,17</B> Who bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power--they lie down together, they shall not rise, they are extinct, they are quenched as a wick:
<B>43,18</B> Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
<B>43,19</B> Behold, I will do a new thing; now shall it spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.
<B>43,20</B> The beasts of the field shall honour Me, the jackals and the ostriches; because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, Mine elect;
<B>43,21</B> The people which I formed for Myself, that they might tell of My praise. <B>{S}</B>
<B>43,22</B> Yet thou hast not called upon Me, O Jacob, neither hast thou wearied thyself about Me, O Israel.
<B>43,23</B> Thou hast not brought Me the small cattle of thy burnt-offerings; neither hast thou honoured Me with thy sacrifices. I have not burdened thee with a meal-offering, nor wearied thee with frankincense.
<B>43,24</B> Thou hast bought Me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou satisfied Me with the fat of thy sacrifices; but thou hast burdened Me with thy sins, thou hast wearied Me with thine iniquities.
<B>43,25</B> I, even I, am He that blotteth out thy transgressions for Mine own sake; and thy sins I will not remember.
<B>43,26</B> Put Me in remembrance, let us plead together; declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.
<B>43,27</B> Thy first father sinned, and thine intercessors have transgressed against Me.
<B>43,28</B> Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and I have given Jacob to condemnation, and Israel to reviling. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>44,1</B> Yet now hear, O Jacob My servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen;
<B>44,2</B> Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, who will help thee: Fear not, O Jacob My servant, and thou, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
<B>44,3</B> For I will pour water upon the thirsty land, and streams upon the dry ground; I will pour My spirit upon thy seed, and My blessing upon thine offspring;
<B>44,4</B> And they shall spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.
<B>44,5</B> One shall say: 'I am the LORD'S'; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>44,6</B> Thus saith the LORD, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer the LORD of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last, and beside Me there is no God.
<B>44,7</B> And who, as I, can proclaim--let him declare it, and set it in order for Me--since I appointed the ancient people? And the things that are coming, and that shall come to pass, let them declare.
<B>44,8</B> Fear ye not, neither be afraid; have I not announced unto thee of old, and declared it? And ye are My witnesses. Is there a God beside Me? Yea, there is no Rock; I know not any.
<B>44,9</B> They that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity, and their delectable things shall not profit; and their own witnesses see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.
<B>44,10</B> Who hath fashioned a god, or molten an image that is profitable for nothing?
<B>44,11</B> Behold, all the fellows thereof shall be ashamed; and the craftsmen skilled above men; let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; they shall fear, they shall be ashamed together.
<B>44,12</B> The smith maketh an axe, and worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with his strong arm; yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth; he drinketh no water, and is faint.
<B>44,13</B> The carpenter stretcheth out a line; he marketh it out with a pencil; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compasses, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, to dwell in the house.
<B>44,14</B> He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the ilex and the oak, and strengtheneth for himself one among the trees of the forest; he planteth a bay-tree, and the rain doth nourish it.
<B>44,15</B> Then a man useth it for fuel; and he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.
<B>44,16</B> He burneth the half thereof in the fire; with the half thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied; yea, he warmeth himself, and saith: 'Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire';
<B>44,17</B> And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image; he falleth down unto it and worshippeth, and prayeth unto it, and saith: 'Deliver me, for thou art my god.'
<B>44,18</B> They know not, neither do they understand; for their eyes are bedaubed, that they cannot see, and their hearts, that they cannot understand.
<B>44,19</B> And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say: 'I have burned the half of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh and eaten it; and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? Shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?'
<B>44,20</B> He striveth after ashes, a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say: 'Is there not a lie in my right hand?' <B>{S}</B>
<B>44,21</B> Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel, for thou art My servant; I have formed thee, thou art Mine own servant; O Israel, thou shouldest not forget Me.
<B>44,22</B> I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins; return unto Me, for I have redeemed thee.
<B>44,23</B> Sing, O ye heavens, for the LORD hath done it; shout, ye lowest parts of the earth; break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein; for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and doth glorify Himself in Israel. <B>{S}</B>
<B>44,24</B> Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, and He that formed thee from the womb: I am the LORD, that maketh all things; that stretched forth the heavens alone; that spread abroad the earth by Myself;
<B>44,25</B> That frustrateth the tokens of the imposters, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;
<B>44,26</B> That confirmeth the word of His servant, and performeth the counsel of His messengers; that saith of Jerusalem: 'She shall be inhabited'; and of the cities of Judah: 'They shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places thereof';
<B>44,27</B> That saith to the deep: 'Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers';
<B>44,28</B> That saith of Cyrus: 'He is My shepherd, and shall perform all My pleasure'; even saying of Jerusalem: 'She shall be built'; and to the temple: 'My foundation shall be laid.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>45,1</B> Thus saith the LORD to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him, and to loose the loins of kings; to open the doors before him, and that the gates may not be shut:
<B>45,2</B> I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight; I will break in pieces the doors of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron;
<B>45,3</B> And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I am the LORD, who call thee by thy name, even the God of Israel.
<B>45,4</B> For the sake of Jacob My servant, and Israel Mine elect, I have called thee by thy name, I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known Me.
<B>45,5</B> I am the LORD, and there is none else, beside Me there is no God; I have girded thee, though thou hast not known Me;
<B>45,6</B> That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside Me; I am the LORD; and there is none else;
<B>45,7</B> I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I am the LORD, that doeth all these things. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>45,8</B> Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open, that they may bring forth salvation, and let her cause righteousness to spring up together; I the LORD have created it. <B>{S}</B>
<B>45,9</B> Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker, as a potsherd with the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to him that fashioned it: 'What makest thou?' Or: 'Thy work, it hath no hands'? <B>{S}</B>
<B>45,10</B> Woe unto him that saith unto his father: 'Wherefore begettest thou?' Or to a woman: 'Wherefore travailest thou?' <B>{S}</B>
<B>45,11</B> Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask Me of the things that are to come; concerning My sons, and concerning the work of My hands, command ye Me.
<B>45,12</B> I, even I, have made the earth, and created man upon it; I, even My hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.
<B>45,13</B> I have roused him up in victory, and I make level all his ways; he shall build My city, and he shall let Mine exiles go free, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts. <B>{S}</B>
<B>45,14</B> Thus saith the LORD: The labour of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine; they shall go after thee, in chains they shall come over; and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee: Surely God is in thee, and there is none else, there is no other God.
<B>45,15</B> Verily Thou art a God that hidest Thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.
<B>45,16</B> They shall be ashamed, yea, confounded, all of them; they shall go in confusion together that are makers of idols.
<B>45,17</B> O Israel, that art saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation; ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>45,18</B> For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens, He is God; that formed the earth and made it, He established it, He created it not a waste, He formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD, and there is none else.
<B>45,19</B> I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness; I said not unto the seed of Jacob: 'Seek ye Me in vain'; I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.
<B>45,20</B> Assemble yourselves and come, draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations; they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.
<B>45,21</B> Declare ye, and bring them near, yea, let them take counsel together: Who hath announced this from ancient time, and declared it of old? Have not I the LORD? And there is no God else beside Me, a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside Me.
<B>45,22</B> Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else.
<B>45,23</B> By Myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from My mouth in righteousness, and shall not come back, that unto Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
<B>45,24</B> Only in the LORD, shall one say of Me, is victory and strength; even to Him shall men come in confusion, all they that were incensed against Him.
<B>45,25</B> In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.
<B>46,1</B> Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle; the things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary beast.
<B>46,2</B> They stoop, they bow down together, they could not deliver the burden; and themselves are gone into captivity. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>46,3</B> Hearken unto Me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that are borne [by Me] from the birth, that are carried from the womb:
<B>46,4</B> Even to old age I am the same, and even to hoar hairs will I carry you; I have made, and I will bear; yea, I will carry, and will deliver. <B>{S}</B>
<B>46,5</B> To whom will ye liken Me, and make Me equal, and compare Me, that we may be like?
<B>46,6</B> Ye that lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance; ye that hire a goldsmith, that he make it a god, to fall down thereto, yea, to worship.
<B>46,7</B> He is borne upon the shoulder, he is carried, and set in his place, and he standeth, from his place he doth not remove; yea, though one cry unto him, he cannot answer, nor save him out of his trouble. <B>{S}</B>
<B>46,8</B> Remember this, and stand fast; bring it to mind, O ye transgressors.
<B>46,9</B> Remember the former things of old: that I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like Me;
<B>46,10</B> Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done; saying: 'My counsel shall stand, and all My pleasure will I do';
<B>46,11</B> Calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of My counsel from a far country; yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass, I have purposed, I will also do it. <B>{S}</B>
<B>46,12</B> Hearken unto Me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness:
<B>46,13</B> I bring near My righteousness, it shall not be far off, and My salvation shall not tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel My glory. <B>{S}</B>
<B>47,1</B> Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.
<B>47,2</B> Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove thy veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.
<B>47,3</B> Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen; I will take vengeance, and will let no man intercede. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>47,4</B> Our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is His name, The Holy One of Israel.
<B>47,5</B> Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou shalt no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.
<B>47,6</B> I was wroth with My people, I profaned Mine inheritance, and gave them into thy hand; thou didst show them no mercy; upon the aged hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.
<B>47,7</B> And thou saidst: 'For ever shall I be mistress'; so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the end thereof. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>47,8</B> Now therefore hear this, thou that art given to pleasures, that sittest securely, that sayest in thy heart: 'I am, and there is none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children';
<B>47,9</B> But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come upon thee, for the multitude of thy sorceries, and the great abundance of thine enchantments.
<B>47,10</B> And thou hast been secure in thy wickedness, thou hast said: 'None seeth me'; thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thy heart. 'I am, and there is none else beside me.'
<B>47,11</B> Yet shall evil came upon thee; thou shalt not know how to charm it away; and calamity shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it away; and ruin shall come upon thee suddenly, before thou knowest.
<B>47,12</B> Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.
<B>47,13</B> Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels; let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee.
<B>47,14</B> Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame; it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.
<B>47,15</B> Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured; they that have trafficked with thee from thy youth shall wander every one to his quarter; there shall be none to save thee. <B>{S}</B>
<B>48,1</B> Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the fountain of Judah; who swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.
<B>48,2</B> For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel, the LORD of hosts is His name. <B>{S}</B>
<B>48,3</B> I have declared the former things from of old; yea, they went forth out of My mouth, and I announced them; suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.
<B>48,4</B> Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;
<B>48,5</B> Therefore I have declared it to thee from of old; before it came to pass I announced it to thee; lest thou shouldest say: 'Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.'
<B>48,6</B> Thou hast heard, see, all this; and ye, will ye not declare it? I have announced unto thee new things from this time, even hidden things, which thou hast not known.
<B>48,7</B> They are created now, and not from of old, and before this day thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say: 'Behold, I knew them.'
<B>48,8</B> Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from of old thine ear was not opened; for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.
<B>48,9</B> For My name's sake will I defer Mine anger, and for My praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.
<B>48,10</B> Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver; I have tried thee in the furnace of affliction.
<B>48,11</B> For Mine own sake, for Mine own sake, will I do it; for how should it be profaned? And My glory will I not give to another. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>48,12</B> Hearken unto Me, O Jacob, and Israel My called: I am He; I am the first, I also am the last.
<B>48,13</B> Yea, My hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand hath spread out the heavens; when I call unto them, they stand up together.
<B>48,14</B> Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? He whom the LORD loveth shall perform His pleasure on Babylon, and show His arm on the Chaldeans.
<B>48,15</B> I, even I, have spoken, yea, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
<B>48,16</B> Come ye near unto Me, hear ye this: From the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I; and now the Lord GOD hath sent me, and His spirit. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>48,17</B> Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the LORD thy God, who teacheth thee for thy profit, who leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.
<B>48,18</B> Oh that thou wouldest hearken to My commandments! then would thy peace be as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea;
<B>48,19</B> Thy seed also would be as the sand, and the offspring of thy body like the grains thereof; his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before Me. <B>{S}</B>
<B>48,20</B> Go ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye: 'The LORD hath redeemed His servant Jacob.
<B>48,21</B> And they thirsted not when He led them through the deserts; He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; He cleaved the rock also, and the waters gushed out.'
<B>48,22</B> There is no peace, saith the LORD concerning the wicked. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>49,1</B> Listen, O isles, unto me, and hearken, ye peoples, from far: the LORD hath called me from the womb, from the bowels of my mother hath He made mention of my name;
<B>49,2</B> And He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword, in the shadow of His hand hath He hid me; and He hath made me a polished shaft, in His quiver hath He concealed me;
<B>49,3</B> And He said unto me: 'Thou art My servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.'
<B>49,4</B> But I said: 'I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought and vanity; yet surely my right is with the LORD, and my recompense with my God.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>49,5</B> And now saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be His servant, to bring Jacob back to Him, and that Israel be gathered unto Him--for I am honourable in the eyes of the LORD, and my God is become my strength--
<B>49,6</B> Yea, He saith: 'It is too light a thing that thou shouldest be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the offspring of Israel; I will also give thee for a light of the nations, that My salvation may be unto the end of the earth.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>49,7</B> Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to him who is despised of men, to him who is abhorred of nations, to a servant of rulers: kings shall see and arise, princes, and they shall prostrate themselves; because of the LORD that is faithful, even the Holy One of Israel, who hath chosen thee. <B>{S}</B>
<B>49,8</B> Thus saith the LORD: In an acceptable time have I answered thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee; and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;
<B>49,9</B> Saying to the prisoners: 'Go forth'; to them that are in darkness: 'Show yourselves'; they shall feed in the ways, and in all high hills shall be their pasture;
<B>49,10</B> They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor sun smite them; for He that hath compassion on them will lead them, even by the springs of water will He guide them.
<B>49,11</B> And I will make all My mountains a way, and My highways shall be raised on high.
<B>49,12</B> Behold, these shall come from far; and, lo, these from the north and from the west, and these from the land of Sinim.
<B>49,13</B> Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth, and break forth into singing, O mountains; for the LORD hath comforted His people, and hath compassion upon His afflicted. <B>{S}</B>
<B>49,14</B> But Zion said: 'The LORD hath forsaken me, and the Lord hath forgotten me.'
<B>49,15</B> Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, these may forget, yet will not I forget thee.
<B>49,16</B> Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of My hands; thy walls are continually before Me.
<B>49,17</B> Thy children make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth from thee.
<B>49,18</B> Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament, and gird thyself with them, like a bride.
<B>49,19</B> For thy waste and thy desolate places and thy land that hath been destroyed--surely now shalt thou be too strait for the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.
<B>49,20</B> The children of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears: 'The place is too strait for me; give place to me that I may dwell.'
<B>49,21</B> Then shalt thou say in thy heart: 'Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering to and fro? And who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>49,22</B> Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations, and set up Mine ensign to the peoples, and they shall bring thy sons in their bosom, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.
<B>49,23</B> And kings shall be thy foster-fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their face to the earth, and lick the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD, for they shall not be ashamed that wait for Me. <B>{S}</B>
<B>49,24</B> Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of the victorious be delivered? <B>{S}</B>
<B>49,25</B> But thus saith the LORD: Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; and I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.
<B>49,26</B> And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob. <B>{S}</B>
<B>50,1</B> Thus saith the LORD: Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, wherewith I have put her away? Or which of My creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities were ye sold, and for your transgressions was your mother put away.
<B>50,2</B> Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is My hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness; their fish become foul, because there is no water, and die for thirst.
<B>50,3</B> I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>50,4</B> The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of them that are taught, that I should know how to sustain with words him that is weary; He wakeneth morning by morning, He wakeneth mine ear to hear as they that are taught.
<B>50,5</B> The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward.
<B>50,6</B> I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
<B>50,7</B> For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore have I not been confounded; therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.
<B>50,8</B> He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand up together; who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.
<B>50,9</B> Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? Behold, they all shall wax old as a garment, the moth shall eat them up. <B>{S}</B>
<B>50,10</B> Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of His servant? though he walketh in darkness, and hath no light, let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God. <B>{S}</B>
<B>50,11</B> Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that gird yourselves with firebrands, begone in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of My hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow. <B>{S}</B>
<B>51,1</B> Hearken to Me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD; look unto the rock whence ye were hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye were digged.
<B>51,2</B> Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bore you; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed him, and made him many.
<B>51,3</B> For the LORD hath comforted Zion; He hath comforted all her waste places, and hath made her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody. <B>{S}</B>
<B>51,4</B> Attend unto Me, O My people, and give ear unto Me, O My nation; for instruction shall go forth from Me, and My right on a sudden for a light of the peoples.
<B>51,5</B> My favour is near, My salvation is gone forth, and Mine arms shall judge the peoples; the isles shall wait for Me, and on Mine arm shall they trust.
<B>51,6</B> Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner; but My salvation shall be for ever, and My favour shall not be abolished. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>51,7</B> Hearken unto Me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is My law; fear ye not the taunt of men, neither be ye dismayed at their revilings.
<B>51,8</B> For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but My favour shall be for ever, and My salvation unto all generations. <B>{S}</B>
<B>51,9</B> Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of ancient times. Art thou not it that hewed Rahab in pieces, that pierced the dragon?
<B>51,10</B> Art thou not it that dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; that made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?
<B>51,11</B> And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. <B>{S}</B>
<B>51,12</B> I, even I, am He that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou art afraid of man that shall die, and of the son of man that shall be made as grass;
<B>51,13</B> And hast forgotten the LORD thy Maker, that stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and fearest continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, as he maketh ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor?
<B>51,14</B> He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not go down dying into the pit, neither shall his bread fail.
<B>51,15</B> For I am the LORD thy God, who stirreth up the sea, that the waves thereof roar; the LORD of hosts is His name.
<B>51,16</B> And I have put My words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of My hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion: 'Thou art My people.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>51,17</B> Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, that hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of His fury; thou hast drunken the beaker, even the cup of staggering, and drained it.
<B>51,18</B> There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.
<B>51,19</B> These two things are befallen thee; who shall bemoan thee? desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword; how shall I comfort thee?
<B>51,20</B> Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.
<B>51,21</B> Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine; <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>51,22</B> Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of His people: behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of staggering; the beaker, even the cup of My fury, thou shalt no more drink it again;
<B>51,23</B> And I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; that have said to thy soul: 'Bow down, that we may go over'; and thou hast laid thy back as the ground, and as the street, to them that go over. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>52,1</B> Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.
<B>52,2</B> Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem; loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. <B>{S}</B>
<B>52,3</B> For thus saith the LORD: Ye were sold for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money. <B>{S}</B>
<B>52,4</B> For thus saith the Lord GOD: My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
<B>52,5</B> Now therefore, what do I here, saith the LORD, seeing that My people is taken away for nought? They that rule over them do howl, saith the LORD, and My name continually all the day is blasphemed.
<B>52,6</B> Therefore My people shall know My name; therefore they shall know in that day that I, even He that spoke, behold, here I am. <B>{S}</B>
<B>52,7</B> How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger of good tidings, that announceth peace, the harbinger of good tidings, that announceth salvation; that saith unto Zion: 'Thy God reigneth!'
<B>52,8</B> Hark, thy watchmen! they lift up the voice, together do they sing; for they shall see, eye to eye, the LORD returning to Zion.
<B>52,9</B> Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem; for the LORD hath comforted His people, He hath redeemed Jerusalem.
<B>52,10</B> The LORD hath made bare His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God. <B>{S}</B>
<B>52,11</B> Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, ye that bear the vessels of the LORD.
<B>52,12</B> For ye shall not go out in haste, neither shall ye go by flight; for the LORD will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rearward. <B>{S}</B>
<B>52,13</B> Behold, My servant shall prosper, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.
<B>52,14</B> According as many were appalled at thee--so marred was his visage unlike that of a man, and his form unlike that of the sons of men--
<B>52,15</B> So shall he startle many nations, kings shall shut their mouths because of him; for that which had not been told them shall they see, and that which they had not heard shall they perceive. <B>{S}</B>
<B>53,1</B> 'Who would have believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the LORD been revealed?
<B>53,2</B> For he shot up right forth as a sapling, and as a root out of a dry ground; he had no form nor comeliness, that we should look upon him, nor beauty that we should delight in him.
<B>53,3</B> He was despised, and forsaken of men, a man of pains, and acquainted with disease, and as one from whom men hide their face: he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
<B>53,4</B> Surely our diseases he did bear, and our pains he carried; whereas we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
<B>53,5</B> But he was wounded because of our transgressions, he was crushed because of our iniquities: the chastisement of our welfare was upon him, and with his stripes we were healed.
<B>53,6</B> All we like sheep did go astray, we turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath made to light on him the iniquity of us all.
<B>53,7</B> He was oppressed, though he humbled himself and opened not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before her shearers is dumb; yea, he opened not his mouth.
<B>53,8</B> By oppression and judgment he was taken away, and with his generation who did reason? for he was cut off out of the land of the living, for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due.
<B>53,9</B> And they made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich his tomb; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.'
<B>53,10</B> Yet it pleased the LORD to crush him by disease; to see if his soul would offer itself in restitution, that he might see his seed, prolong his days, and that the purpose of the LORD might prosper by his hand:
<B>53,11</B> Of the travail of his soul he shall see to the full, even My servant, who by his knowledge did justify the Righteous One to the many, and their iniquities he did bear.
<B>53,12</B> Therefore will I divide him a portion among the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the mighty; because he bared his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>54,1</B> Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear, break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail; for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.
<B>54,2</B> Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations, spare not; lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.
<B>54,3</B> For thou shalt spread abroad on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
<B>54,4</B> Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed. Neither be thou confounded, for thou shalt not be put to shame; for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and the reproach of thy widowhood shalt thou remember no more.
<B>54,5</B> For thy Maker is thy husband, the LORD of hosts is His name; and the Holy One of Israel is thy Redeemer, the God of the whole earth shall He be called.
<B>54,6</B> For the LORD hath called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit; and a wife of youth, can she be rejected? saith thy God.
<B>54,7</B> For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great compassion will I gather thee.
<B>54,8</B> In a little wrath I hid My face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have compassion on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer. <B>{S}</B>
<B>54,9</B> For this is as the waters of Noah unto Me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.
<B>54,10</B> For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but My kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall My covenant of peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath compassion on thee. <B>{S}</B>
<B>54,11</B> O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will set thy stones in fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.
<B>54,12</B> And I will make thy pinnacles of rubies, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy border of precious stones.
<B>54,13</B> And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children.
<B>54,14</B> In righteousness shalt thou be established; be thou far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear, and from ruin, for it shall not come near thee.
<B>54,15</B> Behold, they may gather together, but not by Me; whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee.
<B>54,16</B> Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the fire of coals, and bringeth forth a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.
<B>54,17</B> No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their due reward from Me, saith the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<B>55,1</B> Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye for water, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
<B>55,2</B> Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your gain for that which satisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto Me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
<B>55,3</B> Incline your ear, and come unto Me; hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
<B>55,4</B> Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a prince and commander to the peoples.
<B>55,5</B> Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and a nation that knew not thee shall run unto thee; because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, for He hath glorified thee. <B>{S}</B>
<B>55,6</B> Seek ye the LORD while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near;
<B>55,7</B> Let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts; and let him return unto the LORD, and He will have compassion upon him, and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.
<B>55,8</B> For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the LORD.
<B>55,9</B> For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.
<B>55,10</B> For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, except it water the earth, and make it bring forth and bud, and give seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
<B>55,11</B> So shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth: it shall not return unto Me void, except it accomplish that which I please, and make the thing whereto I sent it prosper.
<B>55,12</B> For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace; the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
<B>55,13</B> Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle; and it shall be to the LORD for a memorial, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>56,1</B> Thus saith the LORD: Keep ye justice, and do righteousness; for My salvation is near to come, and My favour to be revealed.
<B>56,2</B> Happy is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that holdeth fast by it: that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. <B>{S}</B>
<B>56,3</B> Neither let the alien, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying: 'The LORD will surely separate me from His people'; neither let the eunuch say: 'Behold, I am a dry tree.' <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>56,4</B> For thus saith the LORD concerning the eunuchs that keep My sabbaths, and choose the things that please Me, and hold fast by My covenant:
<B>56,5</B> Even unto them will I give in My house and within My walls a monument and a memorial better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting memorial, that shall not be cut off. <B>{S}</B>
<B>56,6</B> Also the aliens, that join themselves to the LORD, to minister unto Him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be His servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and holdeth fast by My covenant:
<B>56,7</B> Even them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon Mine altar; for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.
<B>56,8</B> Saith the Lord GOD who gathereth the dispersed of Israel: Yet I will gather others to him, beside those of him that are gathered.
<B>56,9</B> All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the forest. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>56,10</B> His watchmen are all blind, without knowledge; they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; raving, lying down, loving to slumber.
<B>56,11</B> Yea, the dogs are greedy, they know not when they have enough; and these are shepherds that cannot understand; they all turn to their own way, each one to his gain, one and all.
<B>56,12</B> 'Come ye, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to-morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.'
<B>57,1</B> The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart, and godly men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.
<B>57,2</B> He entereth into peace, they rest in their beds, each one that walketh in his uprightness. <B>{S}</B>
<B>57,3</B> But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot.
<B>57,4</B> Against whom do ye sport yourselves? Against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? Are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,
<B>57,5</B> Ye that inflame yourselves among the terebinths, under every leafy tree; that slay the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?
<B>57,6</B> Among the smooth stones of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot; even to them hast thou poured a drink-offering, thou hast offered a meal-offering. Should I pacify Myself for these things?
<B>57,7</B> Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed; thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.
<B>57,8</B> And behind the doors and the posts hast thou set up thy symbol; for thou hast uncovered, and art gone up from Me, thou hast enlarged thy bed, and chosen thee of them whose bed thou lovedst, whose hand thou sawest.
<B>57,9</B> And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thine ambassadors far off, even down to the nether-world.
<B>57,10</B> Thou wast wearied with the length of thy way; yet saidst thou not: 'There is no hope'; thou didst find a renewal of thy strength, therefore thou wast not affected.
<B>57,11</B> And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou wouldest fail? And as for Me, thou hast not remembered Me, nor laid it to thy heart. Have not I held My peace even of long time? Therefore thou fearest Me not.
<B>57,12</B> I will declare thy righteousness; thy works also--they shall not profit thee.
<B>57,13</B> When thou criest, let them that thou hast gathered deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away, a breath shall bear them off; but he that taketh refuge in Me shall possess the land, and shall inherit My holy mountain.
<B>57,14</B> And He will say: cast ye up, cast ye up, clear the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of My people. <B>{S}</B>
<B>57,15</B> For thus saith the High and Lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
<B>57,16</B> For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit that enwrappeth itself is from Me, and the souls which I have made.
<B>57,17</B> For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth and smote him, I hid Me and was wroth; and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.
<B>57,18</B> I have seen his ways, and will heal him; I will lead him also, and requite with comforts him and his mourners.
<B>57,19</B> Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith the LORD that createth the fruit of the lips; and I will heal him.
<B>57,20</B> But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.
<B>57,21</B> There is no peace, saith my God concerning the wicked. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>58,1</B> Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a horn, and declare unto My people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.
<B>58,2</B> Yet they seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways; as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of Me righteous ordinances, they delight to draw near unto God.
<B>58,3</B> 'Wherefore have we fasted, and Thou seest not? Wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and Thou takest no knowledge?'--Behold, in the day of your fast ye pursue your business, and exact all your labours.
<B>58,4</B> Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness; ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.
<B>58,5</B> Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?
<B>58,6</B> Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the fetters of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?
<B>58,7</B> Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
<B>58,8</B> Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee, the glory of the LORD shall be thy rearward.
<B>58,9</B> Then shalt thou call, and the LORD will answer; thou shalt cry, and He will say: 'Here I am.' If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedness;
<B>58,10</B> And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thy gloom be as the noon-day;
<B>58,11</B> And the LORD will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make strong thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.
<B>58,12</B> And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places, thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in.
<B>58,13</B> If thou turn away thy foot because of the sabbath, from pursuing thy business on My holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, and the holy of the LORD honourable; and shalt honour it, not doing thy wonted ways, nor pursuing thy business, nor speaking thereof;
<B>58,14</B> Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD, and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>59,1</B> Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, neither His ear heavy, that it cannot hear;
<B>59,2</B> But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid His face from you, that He will not hear.
<B>59,3</B> For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue muttereth wickedness.
<B>59,4</B> None sueth in righteousness, and none pleadeth in truth; they trust in vanity, and speak lies, they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
<B>59,5</B> They hatch basilisks' eggs, and weave the spider's web; he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.
<B>59,6</B> Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall men cover themselves with their works; their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.
<B>59,7</B> Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, desolation and destruction are in their paths.
<B>59,8</B> The way of peace they know not, and there is no right in their goings; they have made them crooked paths, whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace.
<B>59,9</B> Therefore is justice far from us, neither doth righteousness overtake us; we look for light, but behold darkness, for brightness, but we walk in gloom.
<B>59,10</B> We grope for the wall like the blind, yea, as they that have no eyes do we grope; we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; we are in dark places like the dead.
<B>59,11</B> We all growl like bears, and mourn sore like doves; we look for right, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.
<B>59,12</B> For our transgressions are multiplied before Thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are present to us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:
<B>59,13</B> Transgressing and denying the LORD, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and perverseness, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
<B>59,14</B> And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth hath stumbled in the broad place, and uprightness cannot enter. <B>{S}</B>
<B>59,15</B> And truth is lacking, and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey. And the LORD saw it, and it displeased Him that there was no justice;
<B>59,16</B> And He saw that there was no man, and was astonished that there was no intercessor; therefore His own arm brought salvation unto Him; and His righteousness, it sustained Him;
<B>59,17</B> And He put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and a helmet of salvation upon His head, and He put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.
<B>59,18</B> According to their deeds, accordingly He will repay, fury to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies; to the islands He will repay recompense.
<B>59,19</B> So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun; for distress will come in like a flood, which the breath of the LORD driveth.
<B>59,20</B> And a redeemer will come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.
<B>59,21</B> And as for Me, this is My covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and My words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever. <B>{S}</B>
<B>60,1</B> Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.
<B>60,2</B> For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but upon thee the LORD will arise, and His glory shall be seen upon thee.
<B>60,3</B> And nations shall walk at thy light, and kings at the brightness of thy rising.
<B>60,4</B> Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: they all are gathered together, and come to thee; thy sons come from far, and thy daughters are borne on the side.
<B>60,5</B> Then thou shalt see and be radiant, and thy heart shall throb and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned unto thee, the wealth of the nations shall come unto thee.
<B>60,6</B> The caravan of camels shall cover thee, and of the young camels of Midian and Ephah, all coming from Sheba; they shall bring gold and incense, and shall proclaim the praises of the LORD.
<B>60,7</B> All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee; they shall come up with acceptance on Mine altar, and I will glorify My glorious house.
<B>60,8</B> Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their cotes?
<B>60,9</B> Surely the isles shall wait for Me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, for the name of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, because He hath glorified thee.
<B>60,10</B> And aliens shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee; for in My wrath I smote thee, but in My favour have I had compassion on thee.
<B>60,11</B> Thy gates also shall be open continually, day and night, they shall not be shut; that men may bring unto thee the wealth of the nations, and their kings in procession.
<B>60,12</B> For that nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
<B>60,13</B> The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the cypress, the plane-tree and the larch together; to beautify the place of My sanctuary, and I will make the place of My feet glorious.
<B>60,14</B> And the sons of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee, and all they that despised thee shall bow down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee the city of the LORD, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
<B>60,15</B> Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.
<B>60,16</B> Thou shalt also suck the milk of the nations, and shalt suck the breast of kings; and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour, and I, the Mighty One of Jacob, thy Redeemer.
<B>60,17</B> For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron; I will also make thy officers peace, and righteousness thy magistrates.
<B>60,18</B> Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.
<B>60,19</B> The sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee; but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.
<B>60,20</B> Thy sun shall no more go down, Neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.
<B>60,21</B> Thy people also shall be all righteous, they shall inherit the land for ever; the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, wherein I glory.
<B>60,22</B> The smallest shall become a thousand, and the least a mighty nation; I the LORD will hasten it in its time. <B>{S}</B>
<B>61,1</B> The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to bring good tidings unto the humble; He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the eyes to them that are bound;
<B>61,2</B> To proclaim the year of the LORD'S good pleasure, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;
<B>61,3</B> To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the mantle of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called terebinths of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, wherein He might glory.
<B>61,4</B> And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall renew the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
<B>61,5</B> And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and aliens shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
<B>61,6</B> But ye shall be named the priests of the LORD, men shall call you the ministers of our God; ye shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their splendour shall ye revel.
<B>61,7</B> For your shame which was double, and for that they rejoiced: 'Confusion is their portion'; therefore in their land they shall possess double, everlasting joy shall be unto them.
<B>61,8</B> For I the LORD love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
<B>61,9</B> And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>61,10</B> I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, He hath covered me with the robe of victory, as a bridegroom putteth on a priestly diadem, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
<B>61,11</B> For as the earth bringeth forth her growth, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause victory and glory to spring forth before all the nations.
<B>62,1</B> For Zion's sake will I not hold My peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her triumph go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a torch that burneth.
<B>62,2</B> And the nations shall see thy triumph, and all kings thy glory; and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall mark out.
<B>62,3</B> Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the open hand of thy God.
<B>62,4</B> Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken, neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate; but thou shalt be called, My delight is in her, and thy land, Espoused; for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be espoused.
<B>62,5</B> For as a young man espouseth a virgin, so shall thy sons espouse thee; and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.
<B>62,6</B> I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, they shall never hold their peace day nor night: 'Ye that are the LORD'S remembrancers, take ye no rest,
<B>62,7</B> And give Him no rest, till He establish, and till He make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.'
<B>62,8</B> The LORD hath sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength: Surely I will no more give thy corn to be food for thine enemies; and strangers shall not drink thy wine, for which thou hast laboured;
<B>62,9</B> But they that have garnered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD, and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of My sanctuary. <B>{S}</B>
<B>62,10</B> Go through, go through the gates, clear ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway, gather out the stones; lift up an ensign over the peoples.
<B>62,11</B> Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth: say ye to the daughter of Zion: 'Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.'
<B>62,12</B> And they shall call them the holy people, The redeemed of the LORD; and thou shalt be called Sought out, a city not forsaken. <B>{S}</B>
<B>63,1</B> 'Who is this that cometh from Edom, with crimsoned garments from Bozrah? This that is glorious in his apparel, stately in the greatness of his strength?'--'I that speak in victory, mighty to save.'--
<B>63,2</B> 'Wherefore is Thine apparel red, and Thy garments like his that treadeth in the winevat?'--
<B>63,3</B> 'I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples there was no man with Me; yea, I trod them in Mine anger, and trampled them in My fury; and their lifeblood is dashed against My garments, and I have stained all My raiment.
<B>63,4</B> For the day of vengeance that was in My heart, and My year of redemption are come.
<B>63,5</B> And I looked, and there was none to help, and I beheld in astonishment, and there was none to uphold; therefore Mine own arm brought salvation unto Me, and My fury, it upheld Me.
<B>63,6</B> And I trod down the peoples in Mine anger, and made them drunk with My fury, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.' <B>{S}</B>
<B>63,7</B> I will make mention of the mercies of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us; and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which He hath bestowed on them according to His compassions, and according to the multitude of His mercies.
<B>63,8</B> For He said: 'Surely, they are My people, children that will not deal falsely'; so He was their Saviour.
<B>63,9</B> In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the angel of His presence saved them; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and He bore them, and carried them all the days of old.
<B>63,10</B> But they rebelled, and grieved His holy spirit; therefore He was turned to be their enemy, Himself fought against them.
<B>63,11</B> Then His people remembered the days of old, the days of Moses: 'Where is He that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of His flock? Where is He that put His holy spirit in the midst of them?
<B>63,12</B> That caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses? That divided the water before them, to make Himself an everlasting name?
<B>63,13</B> That led them through the deep, as a horse in the wilderness, without stumbling?
<B>63,14</B> As the cattle that go down into the valley, the spirit of the LORD caused them to rest; so didst Thou lead Thy people, to make Thyself a glorious name.'
<B>63,15</B> Look down from heaven, and see, even from Thy holy and glorious habitation; Where is Thy zeal and Thy mighty acts, the yearning of Thy heart and Thy compassions, now restrained toward me?
<B>63,16</B> For Thou art our Father; for Abraham knoweth us not, and Israel doth not acknowledge us; Thou, O LORD, art our Father, our Redeemer from everlasting is Thy name.
<B>63,17</B> O LORD, why dost Thou make us to err from Thy ways, and hardenest our heart from Thy fear? Return for Thy servants' sake, the tribes of Thine inheritance.
<B>63,18</B> Thy holy people they have well nigh driven out, our adversaries have trodden down Thy sanctuary.
<B>63,19</B> We are become as they over whom Thou never borest rule, as they that were not called by Thy name. Oh, that Thou wouldest rend the heavens, that Thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at Thy presence,
<B>64,1</B> As when fire kindleth the brush-wood, and the fire causeth the waters to boil; to make Thy name known to Thine adversaries, that the nations might tremble at Thy presence,
<B>64,2</B> When Thou didst tremendous things which we looked not for--Oh that Thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at Thy presence!-- <B>{S}</B>
<B>64,3</B> And whereof from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God beside Thee, who worketh for him that waiteth for Him.
<B>64,4</B> Thou didst take away him that joyfully worked righteousness, those that remembered Thee in Thy ways--behold, Thou wast wroth, and we sinned--upon them have we stayed of old, that we might be saved.
<B>64,5</B> And we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment; and we all do fade as a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
<B>64,6</B> And there is none that calleth upon Thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of Thee; for Thou hast hid Thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities.
<B>64,7</B> But now, O LORD, Thou art our Father; we are the clay, and Thou our potter, and we all are the work of Thy hand.
<B>64,8</B> Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever; behold, look, we beseech Thee, we are all Thy people.
<B>64,9</B> Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
<B>64,10</B> Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised Thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
<B>64,11</B> Wilt Thou refrain Thyself for these things, O LORD? Wilt Thou hold Thy peace, and afflict us very sore? <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>65,1</B> I gave access to them that asked not for Me, I was at hand to them that sought Me not; I said: 'Behold Me, behold Me', unto a nation that was not called by My name.
<B>65,2</B> I have spread out My hands all the day unto a rebellious people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;
<B>65,3</B> A people that provoke Me to My face continually, that sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense upon bricks;
<B>65,4</B> That sit among the graves, and lodge in the vaults; that eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
<B>65,5</B> That say: 'Stand by thyself, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou'; these are a smoke in My nose, a fire that burneth all the day.
<B>65,6</B> Behold, it is written before Me; I will not keep silence, except I have requited, yea, I will requite into their bosom,
<B>65,7</B> Your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, that have offered upon the mountains, and blasphemed Me upon the hills; therefore will I first measure their wage into their bosom. <B>{S}</B>
<B>65,8</B> Thus saith the LORD: As, when wine is found in the cluster, one saith: 'Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it'; so will I do for My servants' sakes, that I may not destroy all.
<B>65,9</B> And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of My mountains; and Mine elect shall inherit it, and My servants shall dwell there.
<B>65,10</B> And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for My people that have sought Me;
<B>65,11</B> But ye that forsake the LORD, that forget My holy mountain, that prepare a table for Fortune, and that offer mingled wine in full measure unto Destiny,
<B>65,12</B> I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer, when I spoke, ye did not hear; but ye did that which was evil in Mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delighted not. <B>{P}</B></P>

<P><B>65,13</B> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, My servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; Behold, My servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; Behold, My servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed;
<B>65,14</B> Behold, My servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.
<B>65,15</B> And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto Mine elect: 'So may the Lord GOD slay thee'; but He shall call His servants by another name;
<B>65,16</B> So that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself by the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from Mine eyes.
<B>65,17</B> For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
<B>65,18</B> But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
<B>65,19</B> And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in My people; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
<B>65,20</B> There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man, that hath not filled his days; for the youngest shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.
<B>65,21</B> And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
<B>65,22</B> They shall not build, and another inhabit, they shall not plant, and another eat; for as the days of a tree shall be the days of My people, and Mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
<B>65,23</B> They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for terror; for they are the seed blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.
<B>65,24</B> And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer, and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
<B>65,25</B> The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, saith the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<B>66,1</B> Thus saith the LORD: The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool; where is the house that ye may build unto Me? And where is the place that may be My resting-place?
<B>66,2</B> For all these things hath My hand made, and so all these things came to be, saith the LORD; but on this man will I look, even on him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word.
<B>66,3</B> He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he broke a dog's neck; he that offereth a meal-offering, as if he offered swine's blood; he that maketh a memorial-offering of frankincense, as if he blessed an idol; according as they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations;
<B>66,4</B> Even so I will choose their mockings, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear, but they did that which was evil in Mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not. <B>{S}</B>
<B>66,5</B> Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at His word: Your brethren that hate you, that cast you out for My name's sake, have said: 'Let the LORD be glorified, that we may gaze upon your joy', but they shall be ashamed.
<B>66,6</B> Hark! an uproar from the city, Hark! it cometh from the temple, Hark! the LORD rendereth recompense to His enemies.
<B>66,7</B> Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.
<B>66,8</B> Who hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen such things? Is a land born in one day? Is a nation brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
<B>66,9</B> Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD; Shall I that cause to bring forth shut the womb? saith thy God. <B>{S}</B>
<B>66,10</B> Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her; rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her;
<B>66,11</B> That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breast of her consolations; that ye may drink deeply with delight of the abundance of her glory. <B>{S}</B>
<B>66,12</B> For thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream, and ye shall suck thereof: Ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees.
<B>66,13</B> As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
<B>66,14</B> And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like young grass; and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward His servants, and He will have indignation against His enemies. <B>{S}</B>
<B>66,15</B> For, behold, the LORD will come in fire, and His chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire.
<B>66,16</B> For by fire will the LORD contend, and by His sword with all flesh; and the slain of the LORD shall be many.
<B>66,17</B> They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go unto the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the detestable thing, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.
<B>66,18</B> For I [know] their works and their thoughts; [the time] cometh, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and shall see My glory.
<B>66,19</B> And I will work a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard My fame, neither have seen My glory; and they shall declare My glory among the nations.
<B>66,20</B> And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an offering unto the LORD, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to My holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring their offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.
<B>66,21</B> And of them also will I take for the priests and for the Levites, saith the LORD.
<B>66,22</B> For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
<B>66,23</B> And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the LORD.
<B>66,24</B> And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcasses of the men that have rebelled against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh. <B>{P}</B><BR></P>
