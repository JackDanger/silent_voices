<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Samaria shall bear her guilt, for she hath rebelled against her God; they shall fall by the sword; their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<P><B>2</B> Return, O Israel, unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast stumbled in thine iniquity.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> Take with you words, and return unto the LORD; say unto Him: 'Forgive all iniquity, and accept that which is good; so will we render for bullocks the offering of our lips.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses; neither will we call any more the work of our hands our gods; for in Thee the fatherless findeth mercy.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for Mine anger is turned away from him.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his fragrance as Lebanon.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> They that dwell under his shadow shall again make corn to grow, and shall blossom as the vine; the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Ephraim [shall say]: 'What have I to do any more with idols?' As for Me, I respond and look on him; I am like a leafy cypress-tree; from Me is thy fruit found.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Whoso is wise, let him understand these things, whoso is prudent, let him know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, and the just do walk in them; but transgressors do stumble therein. <B>{P}</B></P>
