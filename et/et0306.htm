<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> Command Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the law of the burnt-offering: it is that which goeth up on its firewood upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereby.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby, it shall not go out; and the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning; and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and shall make smoke thereon the fat of the peace-offerings.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, in front of the altar.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering, and shall make the memorial-part thereof smoke upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat; it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of My offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the guilt-offering.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it, as a due for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of the LORD made by fire; whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<P><B>12</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> On a griddle it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in; in broken pieces shalt thou offer the meal-offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD.
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it, it is a due for ever; it shall be wholly made to smoke unto the LORD.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<P><B>17</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying: This is the law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before the LORD; it is most holy.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it; in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken; and if it be sodden in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Every male among the priests may eat thereof; it is most holy.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. <B>{P}</B></P>
