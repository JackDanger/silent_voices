<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Malachi Chapter 1</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say: 'Wherein hast Thou loved us?' Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD; yet I loved Jacob;
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> But Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Whereas Edom saith: 'We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places'; thus saith the LORD of hosts: They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall be called the border of wickedness, and the people whom the LORD execrateth for ever.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say: 'The LORD is great beyond the border of Israel.'
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master; if then I be a father, where is My honour? and if I be a master, where is My fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise My name. And ye say: 'Wherein have we despised Thy name?'
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> Ye offer polluted bread upon Mine altar. And ye say: 'Wherein have we polluted thee?' In that ye say: 'The table of the LORD is contemptible.'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it no evil! And when ye offer the lame and sick, is it no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And now, I pray you, entreat the favour of God that He may be gracious unto us!--this hath been of your doing.--will He accept any of your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Oh that there were even one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on Mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same My name is great among the nations; and in every place offerings are presented unto My name, even pure oblations; for My name is great among the nations, saith the LORD of hosts.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> But ye profane it, in that ye say: 'The table of the LORD is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even the food thereof, is contemptible.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Ye say also: 'Behold, what a weariness is it!' and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering; should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD. <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> But cursed be he that dealeth craftily, whereas he hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and My name is feared among the nations.</P>
