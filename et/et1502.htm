<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Moab, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> So will I send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the horn;
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<P><B>4</B> Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they have rejected the law of the LORD, and have not kept His statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which their fathers did walk.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> So will I send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<P><B>6</B> Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not reverse it: because they sell the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes;
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the humble; and a man and his father go unto the same maid, to profane My holy name;
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge, and in the house of their God they drink the wine of them that have been fined.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorites.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying: 'Prophesy not.'
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> Behold, I will make it creak under you, as a cart creaketh that is full of sheaves.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And flight shall fail the swift, and the strong shall not exert his strength, neither shall the mighty deliver himself;
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself; neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself;
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
