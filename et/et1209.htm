<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Ezekiel Chapter 9</H1>
<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Then he called in mine ears with a loud voice, saying: 'Cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.'
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> And, behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lieth toward the north, every man with his weapon of destruction in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer's inkhorn on his side. And they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house; and He called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer's inkhorn on his side. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<P><B>4</B> And the LORD said unto him: 'Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.'
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And to the others He said in my hearing: 'Go ye through the city after him, and smite; let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity;
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> slay utterly the old man, the young man and the maiden, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.' Then they began at the elders that were before the house.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And He said unto them: 'Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain; go ye forth.' And they went forth, and smote in the city.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said: 'Ah Lord GOD! wilt Thou destroy all the residue of Israel in Thy pouring out of Thy fury upon Jerusalem?'
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> Then said He unto me: 'The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wresting of judgment; for they say: The LORD hath forsaken the land, and the LORD seeth not.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> And as for Me also, Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.'
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And, behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn on his side, reported, saying: 'I have done according to all that Thou hast commanded me.' <B>{P}</B></P>
