<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain, even of the LORD that maketh lightnings; and He will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and the dreams speak falsely, they comfort in vain; therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<P><B>3</B> Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for the LORD of hosts hath remembered His flock the house of Judah, and maketh them as His majestic horse in the battle.
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> Out of them shall come forth the corner-stone, out of them the stake, out of them the battle bow, out of them every master together.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And they shall be as mighty men, treading down in the mire of the streets in the battle, and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them; and the riders on horses shall be confounded.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back, for I have compassion upon them, and they shall be as though I had not cast them off; for I am the LORD their God, and I will hear them.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine; yea, their children shall see it, and rejoice, their heart shall be glad in the LORD.
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> I will hiss for them, and gather them, for I have redeemed them; and they shall increase as they have increased.
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<B>9</B> And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember Me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and shall return.
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> I will bring them back also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not suffice them.
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> And over the sea affliction shall pass, and the waves shall be smitten in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in His name, saith the LORD. <B>{P}</B></P>
