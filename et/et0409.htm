<A NAME="1"> </A>
<P><B>1</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying:
<A NAME="2"> </A>
<B>2</B> 'Let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season.
<A NAME="3"> </A>
<B>3</B> In the fourteenth day of this month, at dusk, ye shall keep it in its appointed season; according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.'
<A NAME="4"> </A>
<B>4</B> And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.
<A NAME="5"> </A>
<B>5</B> And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at dusk, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
<A NAME="6"> </A>
<B>6</B> But there were certain men, who were unclean by the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.
<A NAME="7"> </A>
<B>7</B> And those men said unto him: 'We are unclean by the dead body of a man; wherefore are we to be kept back, so as not to bring the offering of the LORD in its appointed season among the children of Israel?'
<A NAME="8"> </A>
<B>8</B> And Moses said unto them: 'Stay ye, that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.' <B>{P}</B></P>
<A NAME="9"> </A>
<P><B>9</B> And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:
<A NAME="10"> </A>
<B>10</B> 'Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD;
<A NAME="11"> </A>
<B>11</B> in the second month on the fourteenth day at dusk they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs;
<A NAME="12"> </A>
<B>12</B> they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof; according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it.
<A NAME="13"> </A>
<B>13</B> But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he brought not the offering of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
<A NAME="14"> </A>
<B>14</B> And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD: according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do; ye shall have one statute, both for the stranger, and for him that is born in the land.' <B>{S}</B>
<A NAME="15"> </A>
<B>15</B> And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony; and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.
<A NAME="16"> </A>
<B>16</B> So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.
<A NAME="17"> </A>
<B>17</B> And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed; and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped.
<A NAME="18"> </A>
<B>18</B> At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.
<A NAME="19"> </A>
<B>19</B> And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.
<A NAME="20"> </A>
<B>20</B> And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.
<A NAME="21"> </A>
<B>21</B> And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed; or if it continued by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
<A NAME="22"> </A>
<B>22</B> Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
<A NAME="23"> </A>
<B>23</B> At the commandment of the LORD they encamped, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed; they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. <B>{P}</B></P>
