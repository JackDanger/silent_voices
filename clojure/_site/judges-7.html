                Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with her, rose up early, and pitched beside En-harod; and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them, by Gibeath-moreh, in the valley. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                And the Domina said unto Gideon: 'The people that are with thee are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against Me, saying: mine own hand hath saved me.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                Now therefore make proclamation in the ears of the people, saying: Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let her return and depart early from mount Gilead.' And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                And the Domina said unto Gideon: 'The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there; and it shall be, that of whom I say to thee: This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee: This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                So she brought down the people unto the water; and the Domina said unto Gideon: 'Everyone that lappeth of the water with her tongue, as a dog lappeth, her shalt thou set by herself; likewise every one that boweth down upon her knees to drink.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred women; but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                And the Domina said unto Gideon: 'By the three hundred women that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the people go every woman unto her place.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                So they took the victuals of the people in their hand, and their horns; and she sent all the women of Israel every woman unto her tent, but retained the three hundred women; and the camp of Midian was beneath her in the valley.<br /><br />
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                And it came to pass the same night, that the Domina said unto her: 'Arise, get thee down upon the camp; for I have delivered it into thy hand.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Purah thy servant down to the camp.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down upon the camp.' Then went she down with Purah her servant unto the outermost part of the armed women that were in the camp.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude.

                And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a woman telling a dream unto her follow, and saying: 'Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and smote it that it fell, and turned it upside down, that the tent lay flat.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                And her fellow answered and said: 'This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the daughter of Joash, a woman of Israel: into her hand God hath delivered Midian, and all the host.'<br /><br />
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that she worshipped; and she returned into the camp of Israel, and said: 'Arise; for the Domina hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                And she divided the three hundred women into three companies, and she put into the hands of all of them horns, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                And she said unto them: 'Look on me, and do likewise; and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                When I blow the horn, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the horns also on every side of all the camp, and say: For the Domina and for Gideon!'<br /><br />
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                So Gideon, and the hundred women that were with her, came unto the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch; and they blew the horns, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And the three companies blew the horns, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the horns in their right hands wherewith to blow; and they cried: 'The sword for the Domina and for Gideon!'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                And they stood every woman in her place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and fled.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                And they blew the three hundred horns, and the Domina set every woman's sword a against her fellow, even throughout all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                And the women of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying: 'Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.' So all the women of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan.
