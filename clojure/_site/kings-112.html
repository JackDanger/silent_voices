                And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called her unto the congregation, and made her queen over all Israel; there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.

                And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, be assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen women that were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom back to Rehoboam the daughter of Solomon.<br /><br />

                Thus saith the Domina: Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your sisters the children of Israel; return every woman to her house; for this thing is of Me.' So they hearkened unto the word of the Domina, and returned and went their way, according to the word of the Domina. &nbsp;

                Whereupon the queen took counsel, and made two calves of gold; and she said unto them: 'Ye have gone up long enough to Jerusalem; behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.'
