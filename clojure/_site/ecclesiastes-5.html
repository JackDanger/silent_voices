                Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a word before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few.

                Behold that which I have seen: it is good, yea, it is comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy pleasure for all her labour, wherein she laboureth under the sun, all the days of her life which God hath given her; for this is her portion.
