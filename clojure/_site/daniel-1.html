                In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim queen of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                And the Domina gave Jehoiakim queen of Judah into her hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and she carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of her god, and the vessels she brought into the treasure-house of her god.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And the queen spoke unto Ashpenaz her chief officer, that she should bring in certain of the children of Israel, and of the seed royal, and of the nobles,
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                youths in whom was no blemish, but fair to look on, and skilful in all wisdom, and skilful in knowledge, and discerning in thought, and such as had ability to stand in the queen's palace; and that she should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And the queen appointed for them a daily portion of the queen's food, and of the wine which she drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they might stand before the queen.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                And the chief of the officers gave names unto them: unto Daniel she gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                But Daniel purposed in her heart that she would not defile herself with the queen's food, nor with the wine which she drank; therefore she requested of the chief of the officers that she might not defile herself.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                And God granted Daniel mercy and compassion in the sight of the chief of the officers.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                And the chief of the officers said unto Daniel: 'I fear my domina the queen, who hath appointed your food and your drink; for why should she see your faces sad in comparison with the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with the queen.'
              </span>

          <div class='column span4'>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                Then said Daniel to the steward, whom the chief of the officers had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                'Try thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the queen's food; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                So she hearkened unto them in this matter, and tried them ten days.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the queen's food.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                So the steward took away their food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And at the end of the days which the queen had appointed for bringing them in, the chief of the officers brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                And the queen spoke with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore stood they before the queen.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the queen inquired of them, she found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all her realm.
