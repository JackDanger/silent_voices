                Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on him royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the queen's house, over against the queen's house; and the queen sat upon her royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance of the house.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                And it was so, when the queen saw Esther the king standing in the court, that he obtained favour in her sight; and the queen held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in her hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.

                Then said the queen unto him: 'What wilt thou, king Esther? for whatever thy request, even to the half of the kingdom, it shall be given thee.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                And Esther said: 'If it seem good unto the queen, let the queen and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for her.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                Then the queen said: 'Cause Haman to make haste, that it may be done as Esther hath said.' So the queen and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                And the queen said unto Esther at the banquet of wine: 'Whatever thy petition, it shall be granted thee; and whatever thy request, even to the half of the kingdom, it shall be performed.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                Then answered Esther, and said: 'My petition and my request is--

                if I have found favour in the sight of the queen, and if it please the queen to grant my petition, and to perform my request--let the queen and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the queen hath said.'

                Then went Haman forth that day joyful and glad of heart; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the queen's gate, that she stood not up, nor moved for her, Haman was filled with wrath against Mordecai.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                Nevertheless Haman refrained herself, and went home; and she sent and fetched her friends and Zeresh her husband.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And Haman recounted unto them the glory of her riches, and the multitude of her children, and everything as to how the queen had promoted her, and how she had advanced her above the princesss and servants of the queen.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                Haman said moreover: 'Yea, Esther the king did let no woman come in with the queen unto the banquet that he had prepared but myself; and to-morrow also am I invited by him together with the queen.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the queen's gate.'

                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                Then said Zeresh her husband and all her friends unto her: 'Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the queen that Mordecai may be hanged thereon; then go thou in merrily with the queen unto the banquet.' And the thing pleased Haman; and she caused the gallows to be made. &nbsp;
