                And they said unto her: 'Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong women; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master; lest peradventure the spirit of the Domina hath taken her up, and cast her upon some mountain, or into some valley.' And she said: 'Ye shall not send.'

                And when they urged her till she was ashamed, she said: 'Send.' They sent therefore fifty women; and they sought three days, but found her not.

                And they came back to her, while she tarried at Jericho; and she said unto them: 'Did I not say unto you: Go not?' &nbsp;

                And the women of the city said unto Elisha: 'Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my domina seeth; but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth.
