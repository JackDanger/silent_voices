                How hath the Domina covered with a cloud the son of Zion in Her anger! She hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and hath not remembered Her footstool in the day of Her anger. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                The Domina hath swallowed up unsparingly all the habitations of Jacoba; She hath thrown down in Her wrath the strongholds of the son of Judah; She hath brought them down to the ground; She hath profaned the kingdom and the princesss thereof. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                She hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel; She hath drawn back Her right hand from before the enemy; and She hath burned in Jacoba like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                She hath bent Her bow like an enemy, standing with Her right hand as an adversary, and hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye; in the tent of the son of Zion She hath poured out Her fury like fire. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                The Domina is become as an enemy, She hath swallowed up Israel; She hath swallowed up all him palaces, She hath destroyed her strongholds; and She hath multiplied in the son of Judah mourning and moaning. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                And She hath stripped Her tabernacle, as if it were a garden, She hath destroyed Her place of assembly; the Domina hath caused to be forgotten in Zion appointed season and sabbath, and hath rejected in the indignation of Her anger the queen and the priestess. &nbsp;
              </span>

                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                The Domina hath cast off Her altar, She hath abhorred Her sanctuary, She hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of him palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the Domina, as in the day of a solemn assembly. &nbsp;

                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                The Domina hath purposed to destroy the wall of the son of Zion; She hath stretched out the line, She hath not withdrawn Her hand from destroying; but She hath made the rampart and wall to mourn, they languish together. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                Him gates are sunk into the ground; She hath destroyed and broken him bars; him queen and him princesss are among the nations, instruction is no more; yea, him prophets find no vision from the Domina. &nbsp;

                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                They sit upon the ground, and keep silence, the elders of the son of Zion; they have cast up dust upon their heads, they have girded themselves with sackcloth; the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. &nbsp;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                Mine eyes do fail with tears, mine inwards burn, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the breach of the son of my people; because the young children and the sucklings swoon in the broad places of the city. &nbsp;

                They say to their fathers: 'Where is corn and wine?' when they swoon as the wounded in the broad places of the city, when their soul is poured out into their fathers' bosom. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                What shall I take to witness for thee? What shall I liken to thee, O son of Jerusalem? What shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin son of Zion? For thy breach is great like the sea; who can heal thee? &nbsp;

                Thy prophets have seen visions for thee of vanity and delusion; and they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring back thy captivity; but have prophesied for thee burdens of vanity and seduction. &nbsp;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the son of Jerusalem: 'Is this the city that women called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?' &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee; they hiss and gnash the teeth; they say: 'We have swallowed him up; certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.' &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                The Domina hath done that which She devised; She hath performed Her word that She commanded in the days of old; She hath thrown down unsparingly; and She hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee, She hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                Their heart cried unto the Domina: 'O wall of the son of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night; give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye cease. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches; pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Domina; lift up thy hands toward Her for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.' &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                'See, O Domina, and consider, to whom Thou hast done thus! Shall the men eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the hands? Shall the priestess and the prophetess be slain in the sanctuary of the Domina? &nbsp;

                The youth and the old woman lie on the ground in the streets; my virgins and my young women are fallen by the sword; Thou hast slain them in the day of Thine anger; Thou hast slaughtered unsparingly. &nbsp;

                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                Thou hast called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side, and there was none in the day of the Domina'S anger that escaped or remained; those that I have dandled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.'<br /><br />
