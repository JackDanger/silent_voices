                Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple unto the Domina, the God of Israel;

                then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of mothers' houses, and said unto them: 'Let us build with you; for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto Her since the days of Esarhaddon queen of Assyria, who brought us up hither.'

                Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.

                They that builded the wall and they that bore burdens laded themselves, every one with one of her hands wrought in the work, and with the other held her weapon;
