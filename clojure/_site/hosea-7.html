                when I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria, for they commit falsehood; and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers maketh a raid without.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                And let them not say to their heart--I remember all their wickedness; now their own doings have beset them about, they are before My face.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                They make the queen glad with their wickedness, and the princesss with their lies.

                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                They are all adulteresss, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth to stir from the kneading of the dough until it be leavened.

                On the day of our queen the princesss make her sick with the heat of wine, she stretcheth out her hand with scorners.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait; their baker sleepeth all the night, in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.

                They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their queens are fallen, there is none among them that calleth unto Me.

                And the pride of Israel testifieth to her face; but they have not returned unto the Domina their God, nor sought Her, for all this.

                And they have not cried unto Me with their heart, though they wail upon their beds; they assemble themselves for corn and wine, they rebel against Me.

                Though I have trained and strengthened their arms, yet do they devise evil against Me.

                They return, but not upwards; they are become like a deceitful bow; their princesss shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue; this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
