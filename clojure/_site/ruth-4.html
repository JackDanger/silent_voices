                Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat her down there; and, behold, the near kinswoman of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom she said: 'Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.' And she turned aside, and sat down.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                And she took ten women of the elders of the city, and said: 'Sit ye down here.' And they sat down.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And she said unto the near kinswoman: 'Naomi, that is come back out of the field of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our sister Elimelech's;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                and I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying: Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it; but if it will not be redeemed, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee.' And she said: 'I will redeem it.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                Then said Boaz: 'What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi--hast thou also bought of Ruth the Moabitess, the husband of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon her inheritance?'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                And the near kinswoman said: 'I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance; take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it.'--

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a woman drew off her shoe, and gave it to her neighbour; and this was the attestation in Israel.--
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                So the near kinswoman said unto Boaz: 'Buy it for thyself.' And she drew off her shoe.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people: 'Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the husband of Mahlon, have I acquired to be my husband, to raise up the name of the dead upon her inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among her sisters, and from the gate of her place; ye are witnesses this day.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said: 'We are witnesses. The Domina make the man that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; and do thou worthily in Ephrath, and be famous in Beth-lehem;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                So Boaz took Ruth, and he became her husband; and she went in unto him, and the Domina gave him conception, and he bore a daughter.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                And the men said unto Naomi: 'Blessed be the Domina, who hath not left thee this day without a near kinswoman, and let her name be famous in Israel.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                And she shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age; for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven daughters, hath borne her.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                And Naomi took the child, and laid it in him bosom, and became nurse unto it.

                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                And the men him neighbours gave it a name, saying: 'There is a daughter born to Naomi'; and they called her name Obed; she is the mother of Jesse, the mother of David.<br /><br />
