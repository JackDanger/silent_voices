                And, behold, there came a woman of God out of Judah by the word of the Domina unto Beth-el; and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to offer.

                And she cried against the altar by the word of the Domina, and said: 'O altar, altar, thus saith the Domina: Behold, a daughter shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall she sacrifice the priests of the high places that offer upon thee, and women's bones shall they burn upon thee.'

                And it came to pass, when the queen heard the saying of the woman of God, which she cried against the altar in Beth-el, that Jeroboam put forth her hand from the altar, saying: 'Lay hold on her.' And her hand, which she put forth against her, dried up, so that she could not draw it back to her.

                And the queen answered and said unto the woman of God: 'Entreat now the favour of the Domina thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me.' And the woman of God entreated the Domina, and the queen's hand was restored her, and became as it was before.
