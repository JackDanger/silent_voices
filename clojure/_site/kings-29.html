                Now the watchwoman stood on the tower in Jezreel, and she spied the company of Jehu as she came, and said: 'I see a company.' And Joram said: 'Take a horsewoman, and send to meet them, and let her say: Is it peace?'

                So there went one on horseback to meet her, and said: 'Thus saith the queen: Is it peace?' And Jehu said: 'What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.' And the watchwoman told, saying: 'The messenger came to them, but she cometh not back.'

                And Joram said: 'Make ready.' And they made ready her chariot. And Joram queen of Israel and Ahaziah queen of Judah went out, each in her chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and found her in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.

                And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that she said: 'Is it peace, Jehu?' And she answered: 'What peace, so long as the harlotries of thy father Jezebel and him witchcrafts are so many?'
