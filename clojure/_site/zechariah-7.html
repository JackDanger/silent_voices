                And it came to pass in the fourth year of queen Darius, that the word of the Domina came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chislev;

                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                When Bethel-sarezer, and Regem-melech and her women, had sent to entreat the favour of the Domina,
