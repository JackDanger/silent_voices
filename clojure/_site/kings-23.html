                And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of making the offering, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.

                Now when all the Moabites heard that the queens were come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood on the border.
