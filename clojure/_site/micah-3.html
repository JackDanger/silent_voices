                Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them, and break their bones; yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.

                Then shall they cry unto the Domina, but She will not answer them; yea, She will hide Her face from them at that time, according as they have wrought evil in their doings.<br /><br />
