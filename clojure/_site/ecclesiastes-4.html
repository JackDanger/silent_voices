                But I returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun; and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they had no comforter.

                Wherefore I praised the dead that are already dead more than the living that are yet alive;

                Again, I considered all labour and all excelling in work, that it is a woman's rivalry with her neighbour. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.

                There is one that is alone, and she hath not a second; yea, she hath neither daughter nor sister; yet is there no end of all her labour, neither is her eye satisfied with riches: 'for whom then do I labour, and bereave my soul of pleasure?' This also is vanity, yea, it is a grievous business.

                Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish queen, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.

                There was no end of all the people, even of all them whom she did lead; yet they that come after shall not rejoice in her. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.
