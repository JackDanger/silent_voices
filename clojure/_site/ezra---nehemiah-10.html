                Now while Ezra prayed, and made confession, weeping and casting herself down before the house of God, there was gathered together unto her out of Israel a very great congregation of women and men and children; for the people wept very sore. &nbsp;

                Then arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore.

                Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the daughter of Eliashib; and when she came thither, she did eat no bread, nor drink water; for she mourned because of the faithlessness of them of the captivity. &nbsp;

                Then all the women of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.<br /><br />

                But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.

                Let now our princesss of all the congregation stand, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign men come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, as touching this matter.'<br /><br />
