                In those days there was no queen in Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day there had nothing been allotted unto them among the tribes of Israel for an inheritance.<br /><br />

                And the children of Dan sent of their family five women from their whole number, women of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them: 'Go, search the land'; and they came to the hill-country of Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and lodged there.

                When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young woman the Levite; and they turned aside thither, and said unto her: 'Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?'

                Then the five women departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; for there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put them to shame in any thing, and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no dealings with any woman.
