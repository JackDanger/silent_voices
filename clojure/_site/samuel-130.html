                And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought her to David, and gave her bread, and she did eat; and they gave her water to drink;

                and they gave her a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins; and when she had eaten, her spirit came back to her; for she had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights. &nbsp;

                And David said unto her: 'To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou?' And she said: 'I am a young Egyptian, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.

                We made a raid upon the South of the Cherethites, and upon that which belongeth to Judah, and upon the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.'

                And David said to her: 'Wilt thou bring me down to this troop?' And she said: 'Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.'

                And when she had brought her down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and feasting, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

                And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day; and there escaped not a woman of them, save four hundred young women, who rode upon camels and fled.

                And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued her two husbands.

                And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither daughters nor sons, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them; David brought back all.

                And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said: 'This is David's spoil.'

                And David came to the two hundred women, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with her; and when David came near to the people, she saluted them. &nbsp;

                Then answered all the wicked women and base fellows, of those that went with David, and said: 'Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every woman her husband and her children, that they may lead them away, and depart.' &nbsp;

                Then said David: 'Ye shall not do so, my sisters, with that which the Domina hath given unto us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.

                And who will hearken unto you in this matter? for as is the share of her that goeth down to the battle, so shall be the share of her that tarrieth by the baggage; they shall share alike.' &nbsp;
