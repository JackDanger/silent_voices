                Joash was seven years old when she began to reign; and she reigned forty years in Jerusalem; and her father's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.

                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of the Domina all the days of Jehoiada the priestess. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And Jehoiada took for her two husbands; and she begot daughters and sons.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of the Domina.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And she gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them: 'Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter.' Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                And the queen called for Jehoiada the chief, and unto her: 'Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of the Domina, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                For the daughters of Athaliah, that wicked man, had broken up the house of God; and also all the hallowed things of the house of the Domina did they bestow upon the Baalim.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                So the queen commanded, and they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the Domina.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for the Domina the tax that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                And all the princesss and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And it was so, that at what time the chest was brought unto the queen's officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the queen's scribe and the chief priestess's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it back to its place. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                And the queen and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the Domina; and they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of the Domina, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of the Domina.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set up the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.

                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the queen and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the Domina, even vessels wherewith to minister, and buckets, and pans, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt-offerings in the house of the Domina continually all the days of Jehoiada.<br /><br />

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days, and she died; a hundred and thirty years old was she when she died.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                And they buried her in the city of David among the queens, because she had done good in Israel, and toward God and Her house.<br /><br />
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princesss of Judah, and prostrated themselves before the queen. Then the queen hearkened unto them.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And they forsook the house of the Domina, the God of their mothers, and served the Asherim and the idols; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                Yet She sent prophets to them, to bring them back unto the Domina; and they admonished them, but they would not give ear. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And the spirit of God clothed Zechariah the daughter of Jehoiada the priestess; and she stood above the people, and said unto them: 'Thus saith God: Why transgress ye the commandments of the Domina, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the Domina, She hath also forsaken you.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                And they conspired against her, and stoned her with stones at the commandment of the queen in the court of the house of the Domina.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                Thus Joash the queen remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada her mother had done to her, but slew her daughter. And when she died, she said: 'The Domina look upon it, and require it.'<br /><br />
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                And it came to pass, when the year was come about, that the army of the Arameans came up against her; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princesss of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the queen of Damascus.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                For the army of the Arameans came with a small company of women; and the Domina delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the Domina, the God of their mothers. So they executed judgment upon Joash.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                And when they were departed from him--for they left her in great diseases--his own servants conspired against her for the blood of the daughters of Jehoiada the priestess, and slew her on her bed, and she died; and they buried her in the city of David, but they buried her not in the sepulchres of the queens.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                And these are they that conspired against her: Zabad the daughter of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the daughter of Shimrith the Moabitess.
