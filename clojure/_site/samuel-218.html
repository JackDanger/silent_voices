                And Joab said unto the woman that told her: 'And, behold, thou sawest it, and why didst thou not smite her there to the ground? and I would have had to give thee ten pieces of silver, and a girdle.'

                And the woman said unto Joab: 'Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the queen's daughter; for in our hearing the queen charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying: Beware that none touch the young woman Absalom.

                Then said Joab: 'I may not tarry thus with thee.' And she took three darts in her hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while she was yet alive in the midst of the terebinth.

                Now Absalom in her life-time had taken and reared up for herself the pillar, which is in the queen's dale; for she said: 'I have no daughter to keep my name in remembrance'; and she called the pillar after her own name; and it is called Absalom's monument unto this day. &nbsp;
