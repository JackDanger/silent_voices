                In the third year of the reign of queen Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the castle, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the stream Ulai.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the stream a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before her, neither was there any that could deliver out of her hand; but she did according to her will, and magnified herself.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground; and the goat had a conspicuous horn between her eyes.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                And she came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the stream, and ran at her in the fury of her power.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                And I saw her come close unto the ram, and she was moved with choler against her, and smote the ram, and broke her two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before her; but she cast her down to the ground, and trampled upon her; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of her hand.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                And the he-goat magnified herself exceedingly; and when she was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up the appearance of four horns toward the four winds of heaven.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauteous land.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                Yea, it magnified itself, even to the princess of the host; and from her the continual burnt-offering was taken away, and the place of her sanctuary was cast down.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt-offering through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it wrought, and prospered.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spoke: 'How long shall be the vision concerning the continual burnt-offering, and the transgression that causes appalment, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled under foot?'
              </span>
          </div>
          <div class='column span4'>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                And she said unto me: 'Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be victorious.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a woman.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                And I heard the voice of a woman between the banks of Ulai, who called, and said: 'Gabriel, make this woman to understand the vision.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                So she came near where I stood; and when she came, I was terrified, and fell upon my face; but she said unto me: 'Understand, O daughter of woman; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                Now as she was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but she touched me, and set me upright.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                And she said: 'Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                The ram which thou sawest having the two horns, they are the queens of Media and Persia.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                And the rough he-goat is the queen of Greece; and the great horn that is between her eyes is the first queen.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with her power.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have completed their transgression, there shall stand up a queen of fierce countenance, and understanding stratagems.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                And her power shall be mighty, but not by her own power; and she shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do; and she shall destroy them that are mighty and the people of the saints.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                And through her cunning she shall cause craft to prosper in her hand; and she shall magnify herself in her heart, and in time of security shall she destroy many; she shall also stand up against the princess of princesss; but she shall be broken without hand.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true; but thou, shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come.'
