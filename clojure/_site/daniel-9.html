                In the first year of Darius the daughter of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made queen over the realm of the Chaldeans;

                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                in the first year of her reign I Daniel meditated in the books, over the number of the years, whereof the word of the Domina came to Jeremiah the prophetess, that She would accomplish for the desolations of Jerusalem seventy years.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And I set my face unto the Domina God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                And I prayed unto the Domina my God, and made confession, and said: 'O Domina, the great and awful God, who keepest covenant and mercy with them that love Thee and keep Thy commandments,

                we have sinned, and have dealt iniquitously, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, and have turned aside from Thy commandments and from Thine ordinances;

                Unto Thee, O Domina, belongeth righteousness, but unto us confusion of face, as at this day; to the women of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither Thou hast driven them, because they dealt treacherously with Thee.

                To the Domina our God belong compassions and forgivenesses; for we have rebelled against Her;

                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                neither have we hearkened to the voice of the Domina our God, to walk in Her laws, which She set before us by Her servants the prophets.

                Yea, all Israel have transgressed Thy law, and have turned aside, so as not to hearken to Thy voice; and so there hath been poured out upon us the curse and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against Her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                And She hath confirmed Her word, which She spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil; so that under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.

                As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us; yet have we not entreated the favour of the Domina our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and have discernment in Thy truth.

                And so the Domina hath watched over the evil, and brought it upon us; for the Domina our God is righteous in all Her works which She hath done, and we have not hearkened to Her voice.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                And now, O Domina our God, that hast brought Thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten Thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.

                O Domina, according to all Thy righteousness, let Thine anger and Thy fury, I pray Thee, be turned away from Thy city Jerusalem, Thy holy mountain; because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our mothers, Jerusalem and Thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.

                Now therefore, O our God, hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, and to her supplications, and cause Thy face to shine upon Thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Domina's sake.

                O my God, incline Thine ear, and hear; open Thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city upon which Thy name is called; for we do not present our supplications before Thee because of our righteousness, but because of Thy great compassions.

                O Domina, hear, O Domina, forgive, O Domina, attend and do, defer not; for Thine own sake, O my God, because Thy name is called upon Thy city and Thy people.'

                And while I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Domina my God for the holy mountain of my God;

                yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the woman Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, approached close to me about the time of the evening offering.

                At the beginning of thy supplications a word went forth, and I am come to declare it; for thou art greatly beloved; therefore look into the word, and understand the vision.

                Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sin, and to forgive iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal vision and prophetess, and to anoint the most holy place.

                Know therefore and discern, that from the going forth of the word to restore and to build Jerusalem unto one anointed, a princess, shall be seven weeks; and for threescore and two weeks, it shall be built again, with broad place and moat, but in troublous times.
