                and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the Domina thy God bore thee, as a woman doth bear her daughter, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">32</sup>
                Yet in this thing ye do not believe the Domina your God,

                <sup class="verse-number">33</sup>
                Who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.'

                <sup class="verse-number">34</sup>
                And the Domina heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">35</sup>
                'Surely there shall not one of these women, even this evil generation, see the good land, which I swore to give unto your mothers,

                save Caleb the daughter of Jephunneh, she shall see it; and to her will I give the land that she hath trodden upon, and to her children; because she hath wholly followed the Domina.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">37</sup>
                Also the Domina was angry with me for your sakes, saying: Thou also shalt not go in thither;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">38</sup>
                Joshua the daughter of Nun, who standeth before thee, she shall go in thither; encourage thou her, for she shall cause Israel to inherit it.

                Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.

                But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.'

                Then ye answered and said unto me: 'We have sinned against the Domina, we will go up and fight, according to all that the Domina our God commanded us.' And ye girded on every woman her weapons of war, and deemed it a light thing to go up into the hill-country.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">42</sup>
                And the Domina said unto me: 'Say unto them: Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.'

                So I spoke unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of the Domina, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.

                And the Amorites, that dwell in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah.

                And ye returned and wept before the Domina; but the Domina hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you.
