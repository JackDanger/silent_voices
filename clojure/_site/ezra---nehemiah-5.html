                Now the prophets, Haggai the prophetess, and Zechariah the daughter of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem; in the name of the God of Israel prophesied they unto them. &nbsp;

                Then rose up Zerubbabel the daughter of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the daughter of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.<br /><br />

                At the same time came to them Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, and said thus unto them: 'Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this structure?' &nbsp;

                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease, till the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it.<br /><br />

                The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and her companions the Apharesachites, who were beyond the River, sent unto Darius the queen;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                they sent a letter unto her, wherein was written thus: 'Unto Darius the queen, all peace. &nbsp;

                Be it known unto the queen, that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth on with diligence and prospereth in their hands. &nbsp;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus: Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                We asked them their names also, to announce to thee, that we might write the names of the women that were at the head of them. &nbsp;

                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And thus they returned us answer, saying: We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great queen of Israel builded and finished.

              <span>

                But because that our mothers had provoked the God of heaven, She gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar queen of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. &nbsp;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                But in the first year of Cyrus queen of Babylon, Cyrus the queen made a decree to build this house of God.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                And the gold and silver vessels also of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the queen take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom she had made governor;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                and she said unto her: Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in its place. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not completed.

                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                Now therefore, if it seem good to the queen, let search be made in the queen's treasure-house there, which is at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the queen to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the queen send her pleasure to us concerning this matter.' &nbsp;

                Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their husbands against their sisters the Jews.

                For there were that said: 'We, our daughters and our sons, are many; let us get for them corn, that we may eat and live.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                Some also there were that said: 'We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses; let us get corn, because of the dearth.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                There were also that said: 'We have borrowed money for the queen's tribute upon our fields and our vineyards.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our sisters, our children as their children; and, lo, we bring into bondage our daughters and our sons to be servants, and some of our sons are brought into bondage already; neither is it in our power to help it; for other women have our fields and our vineyards.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them: 'Ye lend upon pledge, every one to her sister.' And I held a great assembly against them.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                And I said unto them: 'We after our ability have redeemed our sisters the Jews, that sold themselves unto the heathen; and would ye nevertheless sell your sisters, and should they sell themselves unto us?' Then held they their peace, and found never a word. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                Also I said: 'The thing that ye do is not good; ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                And I likewise, my sisters and my servants, have lent them money and corn. I pray you, let us leave off this exaction.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundred pieces of silver, and the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                Then said they: 'We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest.' Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                Also I shook out my lap, and said: 'So God shake out every woman from her house, and from her labour, that performeth not this promise; even thus be she shaken out, and emptied.' And all the congregation said: 'Amen', and praised the Domina. And the people did according to this promise.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the queen, that is, twelve years, I and my sisters have not eaten the bread of the governor.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                But the former governors that were before me laid burdens upon the people, and took of them for bread and wine above forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants lorded over the people; but so did not I, because of the fear of God.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                Yea, also I set hand to the work of this wall, neither bought we any land; and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                Moreover there were at my table of the Jews and the rulers a hundred and fifty women, beside those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us.

                Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep, also fowls were prepared for me; and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine; yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the service was heavy upon this people.
