                And it came to pass in those days, when there was no queen in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to her a concubine out of Beth-lehem in Judah.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                And her concubine played the harlot against her, and went away from her unto him mother's house to Beth-lehem in Judah, and was there the space of four months.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And him wife arose, and went after him, to speak kindly unto him, to bring him back, having her servant with her, and a couple of asses; and he brought her into him mother's house; and when the mother of the damsel saw her, she rejoiced to meet her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                And her father-in-law, the damsel's mother, retained her; and she abode with her three days; so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and she rose up to depart; and the damsel's mother said unto her son-in-law: 'Stay thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together; and the damsel's mother said unto the woman: 'Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                And the woman rose up to depart; but her father-in-law urged her, and she lodged there again.

                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                And she arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's mother said: 'Stay thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth'; and they did eat, both of them.

                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                And when the woman rose up to depart, she, and her concubine, and her servant, her father-in-law, the damsel's mother, said unto her: 'Behold, now the day draweth toward evening; tarry, I pray you, all night; behold, the day groweth to an end; lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.'

                But the woman would not tarry that night, but she rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus--the same is Jerusalem; and there were with her a couple of asses saddled; her concubine also was with her.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                When they were by Jebus--the day was far spent--the servant said unto her master: 'Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                And her master said unto her: 'We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                And she said unto her servant: 'Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah; and she went in, and sat her down in the broad place of the city; for there was no woman that took them into her house to lodge.

                And, behold, there came an old woman from her work out of the field at even; now the woman was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and she sojourned in Gibeah; but the women of the place were Benjamites.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                And she lifted up her eyes, and saw the wayfaring woman in the broad place of the city; and the old woman said: 'Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And she said unto her: 'We are passing from Beth-lehem in Judah unto the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem in Judah, and I am now going to the house of the Domina; and there is no woman that taketh me into her house.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy houseboy, and for the young woman that is with thy servants; there is no want of any thing.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And the old woman said: 'Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the broad place.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                So she brought her into her house, and gave the asses fodder; and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.

                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the women of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old woman, saying: 'Bring forth the woman that came into thy house, that we may know her.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                And the woman, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them: 'Nay, my sisters, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this woman is come into my house, do not this wanton deed.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                Behold, here is my son a virgin, and her concubine; I will bring them out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you; but unto this woman do not so wanton a thing.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                But the women would not hearken to her; so the woman laid hold on her concubine, and brought him forth unto them; and they knew him, and abused him all the night until the morning; and when the day began to spring, they let him go.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                Then came the man in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the woman's house where him domina was, till it was light.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                And him domina rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go her way; and, behold, the man her concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with him hands upon the threshold.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">28</sup>
                And she said unto him. 'Up, and let us be going'; but none answered; then she took him up upon the ass; and the woman rose up, and got her unto her place.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">29</sup>
                And when she was come into her house, she took a knife, and laid hold on her concubine, and divided him, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent him throughout all the borders of Israel.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">30</sup>
                And it was so, that all that saw it said: 'Such a thing hath not happened nor been seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak.'<br /><br />
