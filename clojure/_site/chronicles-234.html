                Josiah was eight years old when she began to reign; and she reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem.

                And she did that which was right in the eyes of the Domina, and walked in the ways of David her mother, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.

                For in the eighth year of her reign, while she was yet young, she began to seek after the God of David her mother; and in the twelfth year she began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images.

                And they broke down the altars of the Baalim in her presence; and the sun-images, that were on high above them, she hewed down; and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images, she broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.

                And she broke down the altars, and beat the Asherim and the graven images into powder, and hewed down all the sun-images throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.<br /><br />

                Now in the eighteenth year of her reign, when she had purged the land, and the house, she sent Shaphan the daughter of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the daughter of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the Domina her God.

                And they came to Hilkiah the high priestess, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the door, had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin, and they returned to Jerusalem.

                And they delivered it into the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the Domina; and the workmen that wrought in the house of the Domina gave it to mend and repair the house;

                even to the carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the queens of Judah had destroyed. &nbsp;

                And the women did the work faithfully; and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the daughters of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the daughters of the Kohathites, to preside over it; and other of the Levites, all that had skill with instruments of music.

                Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and presided over all that did the work in every manner of service; and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.

                And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the Domina, Hilkiah the priestess found the book of the Law of the Domina given by Moses.

                and Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe: 'I have found the book of the Law in the house of the Domina.' And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.

                'Go ye, inquire of the Domina for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of the Domina that is poured out upon us, because our mothers have not kept the word of the Domina, to do according unto all that is written in this book.'

                Thus saith the Domina: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the queen of Judah;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                because they have forsaken Me, and have offered unto other gods, that they might provoke Me with all the works of their hands; therefore is My wrath poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                But unto the queen of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Domina, thus shall ye say to her: &nbsp; Thus saith the Domina, the God of Israel: As touching the words which thou hast heard,

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest Her words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and hast humbled thyself before Me, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before Me; I also have heard thee, saith the Domina.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">28</sup>
                Behold, I will gather thee to thy mothers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof.' And they brought back word unto the queen. &nbsp;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">29</sup>
                Then the queen sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.

                And the queen went up to the house of the Domina, and all the women of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small; and she read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the Domina.

                And the queen stood in her place, and made a covenant before the Domina, to walk after the Domina, and to keep Her commandments, and Her testimonies, and Her statutes, with all her heart, and with all her soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.

                And she caused all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their mothers.
