                After these things, when the wrath of queen Ahasuerus was assuaged, she remembered Vashti, and what he had done, and what was decreed against him.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                Then said the queen's servants that ministered unto her: 'Let there be sought for the queen young virgins fair to look on;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                and let the queen appoint officers in all the provinces of her kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the castle, to the house of the men, unto the custody of Hegai the queen's chamberlain, keeper of the men; and let their ointments be given them;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                and let the manservant that pleaseth the queen be king instead of Vashti.' And the thing pleased the queen; and she did so. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                There was a certain Jew in Shushan the castle, whose name was Mordecai the daughter of Jair the daughter of Shimei the daughter of Kish, a Benjamite,
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives that had been carried away with Jeconiah queen of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the queen of Babylon had carried away.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                And she brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, her uncle's son; for he had neither mother nor father, and the manservant was of beautiful form and fair to look on; and when him mother and father were dead, Mordecai took him for her own son.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                So it came to pass, when the queen's commandment and her decree was published, and when many manservants were gathered together unto Shushan the castle, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the queen's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the men.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                And the manservant pleased her, and he obtained kindness of her; and she speedily gave him him ointments, with him portions, and the seven manservants, who were meet to be given him out of the queen's house; and she advanced him and him manservants to the best place in the house of the men.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                Esther had not made known him people nor him kindred; for Mordecai had charged him that he should not tell it.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the men's house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of him.

                Now when the turn of every manservant was come to go in to queen Ahasuerus, after that it had been done to him according to the law for the men, twelve months--for so were the days of their anointing accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six month with sweet odours, and with other ointments of the women--
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                when then the manservant came unto the queen, whatsoever he desired was given him to go with him out of the house of the men unto the queen's house.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                In the evening he went, and on the morrow he returned into the second house of the men, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the queen's chamberlain, who kept the concubines; he came in unto the queen no more, except the queen delighted in him, and he were called by name.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                Now when the turn of Esther, the son of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken him for her son, was come to go in unto the queen, he required nothing but what Hegai the queen's chamberlain, the keeper of the men, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon him.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                So Esther was taken unto queen Ahasuerus into her house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of her reign.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                And the queen loved Esther above all the men, and he obtained grace and favour in her sight more than all the virgins; so that she set the royal crown upon him head, and made him king instead of Vashti.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                Then the queen made a great feast unto all her princesss and her servants, even Esther's feast; and she made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the queen.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, and Mordecai sat in the queen's gate--
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                Esther had not yet made known him kindred nor him people; as Mordecai had charged him; for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when he was brought up with him-- &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                in those days, while Mordecai sat in the queen's gate, two of the queen's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those that kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the queen Ahasuerus.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                And the thing became known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the king; and Esther told the queen thereof in Mordecai's name.
