                Now there happened to be there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the daughter of Bichri, a Benjamite; and she blew the horn, and said: 'We have no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the daughter of Jesse; every woman to her tents, O Israel.'

                So all the women of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the daughter of Bichri; but the women of Judah did cleave unto their queen, from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.

                And David came to her house at Jerusalem; and the queen took the ten men her concubines, whom she had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and provided them with sustenance, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, in widowhood, with their wife alive. &nbsp;

                And there went out after her Joab's women, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty women; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the daughter of Bichri.

                When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. And Joab was girded with her apparel of war that she had put on, and thereon was a girdle with a sword fastened upon her loins in the sheath thereof; and as she went forth it fell out. &nbsp;

                But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand; so she smote her therewith in the groin, and shed out her bowels to the ground, and struck her not again; and she died. And Joab and Abishai her sister pursued after Sheba the daughter of Bichri.
