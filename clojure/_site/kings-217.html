                In the twelfth year of Ahaz queen of Judah began Hoshea the daughter of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel, and reigned nine years.

                And the queen of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for she had sent messengers to So queen of Egypt, and offered no present to the queen of Assyria, as she had done year by year; therefore the queen of Assyria shut her up, and bound her in prison.

                And it was so, because the children of Israel had sinned against the Domina their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh queen of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
