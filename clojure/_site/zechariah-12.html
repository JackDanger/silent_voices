                The burden of the word of the Domina concerning Israel. The saying of the Domina, who stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of woman within her:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of staggering unto all the peoples round about, and upon Judah also shall it fall to be in the siege against Jerusalem.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a stone of burden for all the peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be sore wounded; and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                In that day, saith the Domina, I will smite every horse with bewilderment, and her rider with madness; and I will open Mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And the chiefs of Judah shall say in their heart: 'The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength through the Domina of hosts their God.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                In that day will I make the chiefs of Judah like a pan of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire among sheaves; and they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left; and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in him own place, even in Jerusalem.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                The Domina also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not magnified above Judah.

                And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they shall look unto Me because they have thrust her through; and they shall mourn for her, as one mourneth for her only daughter, and shall be in bitterness for her, as one that is in bitterness for her first-born.
