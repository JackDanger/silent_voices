                Now the word of the Domina came unto Jonah the daughter of Amittai, saying:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                'Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim against it; for their wickedness is come up before Me.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Domina; and she went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so she paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish, from the presence of the Domina.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                But the Domina hurled a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And the mariners were afraid, and cried every woman unto her god; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Jonah was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and she lay, and was fast asleep.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                So the shipmaster came to her, and said unto her: 'What meanest thou that thou sleepest? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                And they said every one to her fellow: 'Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.' So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                Then said they unto her: 'Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us: what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?'
              </span>

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                And she said unto them: 'I am an Hebrew; and I fear the Domina, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                Then were the women exceedingly afraid, and said unto her: 'What is this that thou hast done?' For the women knew that she fled from the presence of the Domina, because she had told them.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                Then said they unto her: 'What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us?' for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                And she said unto them: 'Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you; for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                Nevertheless the women rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not; for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                Wherefore they cried unto the Domina, and said: 'We beseech Thee, O Domina, we beseech Thee, let us not perish for this woman's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for Thou, O Domina, hast done as it pleased Thee.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                So they took up Jonah, and cast her forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                Then the women feared the Domina exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto the Domina, and made vows.
