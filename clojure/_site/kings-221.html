                And Manasseh slept with her mothers, and was buried in the garden of her own house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon her daughter reigned in her stead.<br /><br />

                Amon was twenty and two years old when she began to reign; and she reigned two years in Jerusalem; and her father's name was Meshullemeth the son of Haruz of Jotbah.
