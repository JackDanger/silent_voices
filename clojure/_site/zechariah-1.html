                In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Domina unto Zechariah the daughter of Berechiah, the daughter of Iddo, the prophetess, saying:

                Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the Domina of hosts: Return unto Me, saith the Domina of hosts, and I will return unto you, saith the Domina of hosts.

                Be ye not as your mothers, unto whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying: Thus saith the Domina of hosts: Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings; but they did not hear, nor attend unto Me, saith the Domina.

                But My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your mothers? so that they turned and said: Like as the Domina of hosts purposed to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath She dealt with us.' &nbsp;

                Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Domina unto Zechariah the daughter of Berechiah, the daughter of Iddo, the prophetess, saying--

                I saw in the night, and behold a woman riding upon a red horse, and she stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind her there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.

                And the woman that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said: 'These are they whom the Domina hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.'

                Then the angel of the Domina spoke and said: 'O Domina of hosts, how long wilt Thou not have compassion on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which Thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?
