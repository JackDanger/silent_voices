                And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the daughter of David had a fair brother, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the daughter of David loved him.

                And Amnon was so distressed that she fell sick because of her brother Tamar; for he was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do any thing unto him.

                But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the daughter of Shimeah David's sister; and Jonadab was a very subtle woman.

                And she said unto her: 'Why, O daughter of the queen, art thou thus becoming leaner from day to day? wilt thou not tell me?' And Amnon said unto her: 'I love Tamar, my sister Absalom's brother.'

                So Amnon lay down, and feigned herself sick; and when the queen was come to see her, Amnon said unto the queen: 'Let my brother Tamar come, I pray thee, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at him hand.'

                So Tamar went to him sister Amnon's house; and she was lying down. And he took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in her sight, and did bake the cakes.
