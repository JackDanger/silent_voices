                Then Micaiah declared unto them all the words that she had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.

                Therefore all the princesss sent Jehudi the daughter of Nethaniah, the daughter of Shelemiah, the daughter of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying: 'Take in thy hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come.' So Baruch the daughter of Neriah took the roll in her hand, and came unto them.

                And they said unto her: 'Sit down now, and read it in our ears.' So Baruch read it in their ears.

                Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch: 'We will surely tell the queen of all these words.'

                And they asked Baruch, saying: 'Tell us now: How didst thou write all these words at her mouth?'

                Then Baruch answered them: 'She pronounced all these words unto me with her mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.' &nbsp;

                Then said the princesss unto Baruch: 'Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah, and let no woman know where ye are.'

                And they went in to the queen into the court; but they had deposited the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the queen.

                So the queen sent Jehudi to fetch the roll; and she took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the queen, and in the ears of all the princesss that stood beside the queen.

                Now the queen was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month; and the brazier was burning before her.

                And it came to pass, when Jehudi had read three or four columns, that she cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.

                Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the queen, nor any of her servants that heard all these words.

                And the queen commanded Jerahmeel the queen's daughter, and Seraiah the daughter of Azriel, and Shelemiah the daughter of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophetess; but the Domina hid them. &nbsp;

                Then the word of the Domina came to Jeremiah, after that the queen had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying:

                And concerning Jehoiakim queen of Judah thou shalt say: Thus saith the Domina: Thou hast burned this roll, saying: Why hast thou written therein, saying: The queen of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence woman and beast? &nbsp;

                Therefore thus saith the Domina concerning Jehoiakim queen of Judah: She shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and her dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.

                Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the daughter of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim queen of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides unto them many like words.<br /><br />
