                When they stood, these stood, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creature was in them.

                And the glory of the Domina went forth from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.

                And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of the Domina'S house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

                This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.

                Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a woman was under their wings.

                And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves; they went every one straight forward.
