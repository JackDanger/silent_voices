                On that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever;

                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them; howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the alien mixture.

                Now before this, Eliashib the priestess, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied unto Tobiah,

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                had prepared for her a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave-offerings for the priests.

                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes queen of Babylon I went unto the queen, and after certain days asked I leave of the queen;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing her a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                And it grieved me sore; therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers; and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense.<br /><br />

                And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to her field.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                Then contended I with the rulers, and said: 'Why is the house of God forsaken?' And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.

                Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the wine and the oil unto the treasuries.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priestess, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan the daughter of Zaccur, the daughter of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their sisters.<br /><br />
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the wards thereof.

                In those days saw I in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in heaps of corn, and lading asses therewith; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I forewarned them in the day wherein they sold victuals.

                There dwelt women of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them: 'What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                Did not your mothers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.'<br /><br />

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath; and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                Then I forewarned them, and said unto them: 'Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you.' From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath. &nbsp;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Thy mercy.<br /><br />

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                In those days also saw I the Jews that had married men of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab;

                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God: 'Ye shall not give your sons unto their daughters, nor take their sons for your daughters, or for yourselves.

                Did not Solomon queen of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no queen like her, and she was beloved of her God, and God made her queen over all Israel; nevertheless even her did the foreign men cause to sin.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to break faith with our God in marrying foreign men?'

                And one of the daughters of Joiada, the daughter of Eliashib the high priestess, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I chased her from me.
