                Nebuchadnezzar the queen made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits; she set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.

                Then Nebuchadnezzar the queen sent to gather together the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the queen had set up.

                Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the queen had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

                Then Nebuchadnezzar in her rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then were these women brought before the queen.

                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                But if not, be it known unto thee, O queen, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.' &nbsp;

                Then was Nebuchadnezzar filled with fury, and the form of her visage was changed, against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; she spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And she commanded certain mighty women that were in her army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.

                Then these women were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, and their robes, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

                Therefore because the queen's commandment was peremptory, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those women that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.

                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                Then Nebuchadnezzar the queen was alarmed, and rose up in haste; she spoke and said unto her ministers: 'Did not we cast three women bound into the midst of the fire?' They answered and said unto the queen: 'True, O queen.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                She answered and said: 'Lo, I see four women loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the appearance of the fourth is like a daughter of the gods.' &nbsp;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace; she spoke and said: 'Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of God Most High, come forth, and come hither.' Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth out of the midst of the fire.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                And the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the queen's ministers, being gathered together, saw these women, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their cloaks changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.

                Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said: 'Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent Her angel, and delivered Her servants that trusted in Her, and have changed the queen's word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.

                Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god that is able to deliver after this sort.'
