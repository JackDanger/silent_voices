                Now in the first year of Cyrus queen of Persia, that the word of the Domina by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the Domina stirred up the spirit of Cyrus queen of Persia, that she made a proclamation throughout all her kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                'Thus saith Cyrus queen of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Domina, the God of heaven, given me; and She hath charged me to build Her a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                Whosoever there is among you of all Her people--his God be with him--let her go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the Domina, the God of Israel, She is the God who is in Jerusalem.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                And whosoever is left, in any place where she sojourneth, let the women of her place help her with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                Then rose up the heads of mothers' houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up to build the house of the Domina which is in Jerusalem.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered. &nbsp;

                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                Also Cyrus the queen brought forth the vessels of the house of the Domina, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of her gods;

                even those did Cyrus queen of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the princess of Judah.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                And this is the number of them: thirty basins of gold, a thousand basins of silver, nine and twenty knives; &nbsp;

                thirty bowls of gold, &nbsp; silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand. &nbsp;

                All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.<br /><br />

                The words of Nehemiah the daughter of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the castle,
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                that Hanani, one of my sisters, came out of Judah, she and certain women; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And they said unto me: 'The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach; the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                and said: 'I beseech Thee, O Domina, the God of heaven, the great and awful God, that keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Her and keep Her commandments;
              </span>
              <span>

                let Thine ear now be attentive, and Thine eyes open, that Thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, which I pray before Thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel Thy servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against Thee; yea, I and my mother's house have sinned.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                We have dealt very corruptly against Thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances which Thou didst command Thy servant Moses.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                Remember, I beseech Thee, the word that Thou didst command Thy servant Moses, saying: If ye deal treacherously, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples;

                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                but if ye return unto Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though your dispersed were in the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to cause My name to dwell there.

                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                Now these are Thy servants and Thy people, whom Thou hast redeemed by Thy great power, and by Thy strong hand.

                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                O Domina, I beseech Thee, let now Thine ear be attentive to the prayer of Thy servant, and to the prayer of Thy servants, who delight to fear Thy name; and prosper, I pray Thee, Thy servant this day, and grant her mercy in the sight of this woman.' Now I was cupbearer to the queen.<br /><br />
