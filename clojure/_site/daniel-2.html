                And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and her spirit was troubled, and her sleep broke from her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                Then the queen commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the queen her dreams. So they came and stood before the queen.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And the queen said unto them: 'I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                Then spoke the Chaldeans to the queen in Aramaic: 'O queen, live for ever! tell thy servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                The queen answered and said to the Chaldeans: 'The thing is certain with me; if ye make not known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                But if ye declare the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour; only declare unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                They answered the second time and said: 'Let the queen tell her servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                The queen answered and said: 'I know of a truth that ye would gain time, inasmuch as ye see the thing is certain with me,
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                that, if ye make not known unto me the dream, there is but one law for you; and ye have agreed together to speak before me lying and corrupt words, till the time be changed; only tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can declare unto me the interpretation thereof.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                The Chaldeans answered before the queen, and said: 'There is not a woman upon the earth that can declare the queen's matter; forasmuch as no great and powerful queen hath asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And it is a hard thing that the queen asketh, and there is none other that can declare it before the queen, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                For this cause the queen was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise women of Babylon.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                So the decree went forth, and the wise women were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and her companions to be slain.<br /><br />
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and discretion to Arioch the captain of the queen's guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise women of Babylon;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                she answered and said to Arioch the queen's captain: 'Wherefore is the decree so peremptory from the queen?' Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                Then Daniel went in, and desired of the queen that she would give her time, that she might declare unto the queen the interpretation.<br /><br />
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                Then Daniel went to her house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, her companions;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                that they might ask mercy of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and her companions should not perish with the rest of the wise women of Babylon.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                Daniel spoke and said: Blessed be the name of God from everlasting even unto everlasting; for wisdom and might are Her;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                And She changeth the times and the seasons; She removeth queens, and setteth up queens; She giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                She revealeth the deep and secret things; She knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with Her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                I thank Thee, and praise Thee, O Thou God of my mothers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me what we desired of Thee; for Thou hast made known unto us the queen's matter.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the queen had appointed to destroy the wise women of Babylon; she went and said thus unto her: 'Destroy not the wise women of Babylon; bring me in before the queen, and I will declare unto the queen the interpretation.' &nbsp;

          <div class='column span4'>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the queen in haste, and said thus unto her: 'I have found a woman of the children of the captivity of Judah, that will make known unto the queen the interpretation.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                The queen spoke and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar: 'Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                Daniel answered before the queen, and said: 'The secret which the queen hath asked can neither wise women, enchanters, magicians, nor astrologers, declare unto the queen;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">28</sup>
                but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and She hath made known to the queen Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:<br /><br />
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">29</sup>
                as for thee, O queen, thy thoughts came [into thy mind] upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and She that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">30</sup>
                But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the queen, and that thou mayest know the thoughts of thy heart.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">31</sup>
                Thou, O queen, sawest, and behold a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was surpassing, stood before thee; and the appearance thereof was terrible.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">32</sup>
                As for that image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">33</sup>

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">34</sup>
                Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">35</sup>
                Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them; and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.

                This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the queen.

                The queen spoke unto Daniel, and said: 'Of a truth it is, that your God is the God of gods, and the Domina of queens, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret.'
