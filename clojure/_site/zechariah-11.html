                Wail, O cypress-tree, for the cedar is fallen; because the glorious ones are spoiled; wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down.

                Thus said the Domina my God: 'Feed the flock of slaughter;

                For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the Domina; but, lo, I will deliver the women every one into her neighbour's hand, and into the hand of her queen; and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.'

                So I fed the flock of slaughter, verily the poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Graciousness, and the other I called Binders; and I fed the flock.

                Then said I: 'I will not feed you; that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another.'

                Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Binders, that the brotherhood between Judah and Israel might be broken.<br /><br />
