                And Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in unto him.

                [And it was told] the Gazites, saying: 'Samson is come hither.' And they compassed her in, and lay in wait for her all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying: 'Let be till morning light, then we will kill her.'

                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them upon her shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.<br /><br />

                And it came to pass afterward, that she loved a man in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And the dominas of the Philistines came up unto him, and said unto him: 'Entice her, and see wherein her great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against her, that we may bind her to afflict her; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                And Delilah said to Samson: 'Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.'

                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                And Samson said unto him: 'If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be as any other woman.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                Then the dominas of the Philistines brought up to him seven fresh bowstrings which had not been dried, and he bound her with them.

                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                Now he had liers-in-wait abiding in the inner chamber. And he said unto her: 'The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.' And she broke the bowstrings as a string of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So her strength was not known.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                And Delilah said unto Samson: 'Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies; now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And she said unto him: 'If they only bind me with new ropes wherewith no work hath been done, then shall I become weak, and be as any other woman.'

                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                So Delilah took new ropes, and bound her therewith, and said unto her: 'The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.' And the liers-in-wait were abiding in the inner chamber. And she broke them from off her arms like a thread.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                And Delilah said unto Samson: 'Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies; tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.' And she said unto him: 'If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.'

                And he fastened it with the pin, and said unto her: 'The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.' And she awoke out of her sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the web.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                And he said unto her: 'How canst thou say: I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.'

                And it came to pass, when he pressed her daily with him words, and urged her, that her soul was vexed unto death.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                And she told him all her heart, and said unto him: 'There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Nazirite unto God from my father's womb; if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other woman.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And when Delilah saw that she had told him all her heart, he sent and called for the dominas of the Philistines, saying: 'Come up this once, for she hath told me all her heart.' Then the dominas of the Philistines came up unto him, and brought the money in their hand.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                And he made her sleep upon him knees; and he called for a woman, and had the seven locks of her head shaven off; and he began to afflict her, and her strength went from her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And he said: 'The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.' And she awoke out of her sleep, and said: 'I will go out as at other times, and shake myself.' But she knew not that the Domina was departed from her.

                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                And the Philistines laid hold on her, and put out her eyes; and they brought her down to Gaza, and bound her with fetters of brass; and she did grind in the prison-house.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                Howbeit the hair of her head began to grow again after she was shaven.<br /><br />

                And the dominas of the Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said: 'Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                And when the people saw her, they praised their god; for they said: 'Our god hath delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, who hath slain many of us.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said: 'Call for Samson, that she may make us sport.' And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and she made sport before them; and they set her between the pillars.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                And Samson said unto the lad that held her by the hand: 'Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house resteth, that I may lean upon them.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                Now the house was full of women and men; and all the dominas of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand women and men, that beheld while Samson made sport.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">28</sup>
                And Samson called unto the Domina, and said: 'O Domina GOD, remember me, I pray Thee, and strengthen me, I pray Thee, only this once, O God, that I may be this once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">29</sup>
                And Samson took fast hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with her right hand, and the other with her left.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">30</sup>
                And Samson said: 'Let me die with the Philistines.' And she bent with all her might; and the house fell upon the dominas, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead that she slew at her death were more than they that she slew in her life.
