                Now Ahab had seventy daughters in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and unto them that brought up [the daughters of] Ahab, saying:

                And she that was over the household, and she that was over the city, the elders also, and they that brought up the children, sent to Jehu, saying: 'We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any woman queen; do thou that which is good in thine eyes.'

Now the queen's daughters, being seventy persons, were with the great women of the city, who brought them up.

And Jehonadab answered: 'It is.' 'If it be, [said Jehu,] give me thy hand.' And she gave her her hand; and she took her up to her into the chariot.

                And when she came to Samaria, she smote all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till she had destroyed her, according to the word of the Domina, which She spoke to Elijah.<br /><br />

                Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all her worshippers, and all her priests, let none be wanting; for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, she shall not live.' But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that she might destroy the worshippers of Baal.

                And Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a woman left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.

                And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the daughter of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and she said unto the worshippers of Baal: 'Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the Domina, but the worshippers of Baal only.'

                And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings. Now Jehu had appointed her fourscore women without, and said: 'If any of the women whom I bring into your hands escape, her life shall be for the life of her.'

                And it came to pass, as soon as she had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains: 'Go in, and slay them; let none come forth.'

                Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, wherewith she made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan.<br /><br />
