                And Abner the daughter of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the daughter of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

                And Joab the daughter of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out; and they met together by the pool of Gibeon, and sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.

                And Abner said to Joab: 'Let the young women, I pray thee, arise and play before us.' And Joab said: 'Let them arise.'

                Then they arose and passed over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the daughter of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.

                And they caught every one her fellow by the head, and thrust her sword in her fellow's side; so they fell down together; wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.

                And the battle was very sore that day; and Abner was beaten, and the women of Israel, before the servants of David.

                And the three daughters of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel; and Asahel was as light of foot as one of the roes that are in the field.

                And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going she turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.

                Then Abner looked behind her, and said: 'Is it thou, Asahel?' And she answered: 'It is I.'

                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                And Abner said to her: 'Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young women, and take thee her armour.' But Asahel would not turn aside from following her.

                And Abner said again to Asahel: 'Turn thee aside from following me; wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy sister?'

                Howbeit she refused to turn aside; wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote her in the groin, that the spear came out behind her; and she fell down there, and died in the same place; and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.

                But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner; and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

                And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.

                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                Then Abner called to Joab, and said: 'Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their sisters?'

                And Joab said: 'As God liveth, if thou hadst not spoken, surely then only after the morning the people had gone away, every one from following her sister.'

                So Joab blew the horn, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.

                And Abner and her women went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.

                And Joab returned from following Abner; and when she had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen women and Asahel.

                But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, even of Abner's men--three hundred and threescore women died.

                And they took up Asahel, and buried her in the sepulchre of her mother, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and her women went all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.
