                In the third year of Cyrus queen of Persia a word was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the word was true, even a great warfare; and she gave heed to the word, and had understanding of the vision.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                In those days I Daniel was mourning three whole weeks.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.<br /><br />
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Tigris,
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a woman clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                her body also was like the beryl, and her face as the appearance of lightning, and her eyes as torches of fire, and her arms and her feet like in colour to burnished brass, and the voice of her words like the voice of a multitude.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                And I Daniel alone saw the vision; for the women that were with me saw not the vision; howbeit a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                So that I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                Yet heard I the voice of her words; and when I heard the voice of her words, then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                And, behold, a hand touched me, which set me tottering upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.

                And she said unto me: 'O Daniel, thou woman greatly beloved, give heed unto the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright; for now am I sent unto thee'; and when she had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                Then said she unto me: 'Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard; and I am come because of thy words.
              </span>
              <span>

                But the princess of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princesss, came to help me; and I was left over there beside the queens of Persia.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the end of days; for there is yet a vision for the days.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                And when she had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                And, behold, one like the similitude of the daughters of women touched my lips; then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said unto her that stood before me: 'O my domina, by reason of the vision my pains are come upon me, and I retain no strength.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                For how can this servant of my domina talk with this my domina? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a woman, and she strengthened me.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                And she said: 'O woman greatly beloved, fear not! peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong.' And when she had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said: 'Let my domina speak; for thou hast strengthened me.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                Then said she: Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the princess of Persia; and when I go forth, lo, the princess of Greece shall come.
