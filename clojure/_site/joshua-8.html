                And the Domina said unto Joshua: 'Fear not, neither be thou dismayed; take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into thy hand the queen of Ai, and her people, and her city, and her land.

                And thou shalt do to Ai and him queen as thou didst unto Jericho and him queen; only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves; set thee an ambush for the city behind it.'

                So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand women, the mighty women of valour, and sent them forth by night.

                And they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say: They flee before us, as at the first; so we will flee before them.

                And Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the ambushment, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua lodged that night among the people.

                And all the people, even the women of war that were with her, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai--now there was a valley between her and Ai.

                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                And she took about five thousand women, and set them in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai.

                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                So the people set themselves in array, even all the host that was on the north of the city, their rear lying in wait on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the vale.

                And it came to pass, when the queen of Ai saw it, that the women of the city hastened and rose up early and went out against Israel to battle, she and all her people, at the time appointed, in front of the Arabah; but she knew not that there was an ambush against her behind the city.

                And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.

                And the Domina said unto Joshua: 'Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thy hand.' And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in her hand toward the city.

                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as she had stretched out her hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and they hastened and set the city on fire.

                And when the women of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.

                And the other came forth out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.

                And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, even in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.

                So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day.

                And the queen of Ai she hanged on a tree until the eventide; and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took her carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day.<br /><br />
