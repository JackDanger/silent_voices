                I said in my heart: 'Come now, I will try thee with mirth, and enjoy pleasure'; and, behold, this also was vanity.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                I said of laughter: 'It is mad'; and of mirth: 'What doth it accomplish?'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                I searched in my heart how to pamper my flesh with wine, and, my heart conducting itself with wisdom, how yet to lay hold on folly, till I might see which it was best for the daughters of women that they should do under the heaven the few days of their life.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the wood springing up with trees;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                I acquired men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                I gathered me also silver and gold, and treasure such as queens and the provinces have as their own; I got me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the daughters of women, men very many.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom stood me in stead.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy, for my heart had joy of all my labour; and this was my portion from all my labour.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness and folly; for what can the woman do that cometh after the queen? even that which hath been already done.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
              </span>
          </div>
          <div class='column span4'>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                The wise woman, her eyes are in her head; but the fool walketh in darkness. And I also perceived that one event happeneth to them all.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                Then said I in my heart: 'As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?' Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                For of the wise woman, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will long ago have been forgotten. And how must the wise woman die even as the fool!
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                So I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And I hated all my labour wherein I laboured under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the woman that shall be after me.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                And who knoweth whether she will be a wise woman or a fool? yet will she have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labour wherein I had laboured under the sun.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                For there is a woman whose labour is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skill; yet to a woman that hath not laboured therein shall she leave it for her portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                For what hath a woman of all her labour, and of the striving of her heart, wherein she laboureth under the sun?
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                For all her days are pains, and her occupation vexation; yea, even in the night her heart taketh not rest. This also is vanity.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                There is nothing better for a woman than that she should eat and drink, and make her soul enjoy pleasure for her labour. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                For who will eat, or who will enjoy, if not I?
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                For to the woman that is good in Her sight She giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner She giveth the task, to gather and to heap up, that she may leave to her that is good in the sight of God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
