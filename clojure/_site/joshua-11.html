                And it came to pass, when Jabin queen of Hazor heard thereof, that she sent to Jobab queen of Madon, and to the queen of Shimron, and to the queen of Achshaph,

                and to the queens that were on the north, in the hill-country and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the Lowland, and in the regions of Dor on the west,

                to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill-country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.

                And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.

                And the Domina said unto Joshua: 'Be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel; thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.'

                So Joshua came, and all the people of war with her, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them.

                And the Domina delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.

                And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and smote the queen thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.

                And all the cities of those queens, and all the queens of them, did Joshua take, and she smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of the Domina commanded.

                And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every woman they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any that breathed.

                So Joshua took all that land, the hill-country, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the Lowland, and the Arabah, and the hill-country of Israel, and the Lowland of the same;

                For it was of the Domina to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed, that they might have no favour, but that they might be destroyed, as the Domina commanded Moses. &nbsp;

                And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
