                For all this I laid to my heart, even to make clear all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it be love or hatred, woman knoweth it not; all is before them.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                All things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to her that sacrificeth and to her that sacrificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner, and she that sweareth, as she that feareth an oath.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event unto all; yea also, the heart of the daughters of women is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                For to her that is joined to all the living there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                As well their love, as their hatred and their envy, is long ago perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God hath already accepted thy works.

                Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no oil.

                Enjoy life with the husband whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which She hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity; for that is thy portion in life, and in thy labour wherein thou labourest under the sun.

                Whatsoever thy hand attaineth to do by thy strength, that do; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. &nbsp;

                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to women of understanding, nor yet favour to women of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                For woman also knoweth not her time; as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the daughters of women snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                This also have I seen as wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great unto me:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                there was a little city, and few women within it; and there came a great queen against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                now there was found in it a woman poor and wise, and she by her wisdom delivered the city; yet no woman remembered that same poor woman.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                Then said I: 'Wisdom is better than strength; nevertheless the poor woman's wisdom is despised, and her words are not heard.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                The words of the wise spoken in quiet are more acceptable than the cry of a ruler among fools.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroyeth much good.
