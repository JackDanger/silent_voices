                Now Naaman, captain of the host of the queen of Aram, was a great woman with her master, and held in esteem, because by her the Domina had given victory unto Aram; she was also a mighty woman of valour, but she was a leper.

                And the Arameans had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and he waited on Naaman's husband.

                And the queen of Aram said: 'Go now, and I will send a letter unto the queen of Israel.' And she departed, and took with her ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.

                And Naaman said: 'If not, yet I pray thee let there be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the Domina.

                In this thing the Domina pardon thy servant: when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and she leaneth on my hand, and I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon, when I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon, the Domina pardon thy servant in this thing.'

                But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the woman of God, said: 'Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman the Aramean, in not receiving at her hands that which she brought; as the Domina liveth, I will surely run after her, and take somewhat of her.'
