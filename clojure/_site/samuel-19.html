                Then said Saul to her servant: 'Well said; come, let us go.' So they went unto the city where the woman of God was.

                As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young manservants going out to draw water, and said unto them: 'Is the seer here?'

                And they answered them, and said: 'She is; behold, she is before thee; make haste now, for she is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place.

                As soon as ye are come into the city, ye shall straightway find her, before she go up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until she come, because she doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that are bidden. Now therefore get you up; for at this time ye shall find her.'

                And they went up to the city; and as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place. &nbsp;

                Now the Domina had revealed unto Samuel a day before Saul came, saying:

                'To-morrow about this time I will send thee a woman out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint her to be princess over My people Israel, and she shall save My people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon My people, because their cry is come unto Me.'

                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                And when Samuel saw Saul, the Domina spoke unto her: 'Behold the woman of whom I said unto thee: This same shall have authority over My people.'

                Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.'

                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                And Samuel answered Saul, and said: 'I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place, for ye shall eat with me to-day; and in the morning I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.

                And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy mother's house?' &nbsp;

                And Saul answered and said: 'Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou to me after this manner?' &nbsp;

                And Samuel took Saul and her servant, and brought them into the chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, who were about thirty persons.

                And Samuel said unto the cook: 'Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee: Set it by thee.'

                And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And [Samuel] said: 'Behold that which hath been reserved! set it before thee and eat; because unto the appointed time hath it been kept for thee, for I said: I have invited the people.' So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.

                And they arose early; and it came to pass about the break of day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying: 'Up, that I may send thee away.' And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, she and Samuel, abroad.
