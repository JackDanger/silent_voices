                Now Heber the Kenite had severed herself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched her tent as far as Elon-bezaanannim, which is by Kedesh.

                Then Jael Heber's husband took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in him hand, and went softly unto her, and smote the pin into her temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for she was in a deep sleep; so she swooned and died.
