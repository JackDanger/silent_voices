                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward she made six boards.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">28</sup>
                And two boards made she for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part;

                <sup class="verse-number">29</sup>
                that they might be double beneath, and in like manner they should be complete unto the top thereof unto the first ring. Thus she did to both of them in the two corners.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">31</sup>
                And she made bars of acacia-wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">32</sup>
                and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">33</sup>
                And she made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">34</sup>
                And she overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">35</sup>
                And she made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; with the cherubim the work of the skilful workman made she it.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">36</sup>
                And she made thereunto four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold, their hooks being of gold; and she cast for them four sockets of silver.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">37</sup>
                And she made a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the weaver in colours;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">38</sup>
