                But the children of Israel committed a trespass concerning the devoted thing; for Achan, the daughter of Carmi, the daughter of Zabdi, the daughter of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing; and the anger of the Domina was kindled against the children of Israel. &nbsp;
