                Bath-sheba therefore went unto queen Solomon, to speak unto her for Adonijah. And the queen rose up to meet him, and bowed down unto him, and sat down on her throne, and caused a throne to be set for the queen's father; and he sat on her right hand.

                And unto Abiathar the priestess said the queen: 'Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art deserving of death; but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of the Domina GOD before David my mother, and because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my mother was afflicted.'

                And the Domina will return her blood upon her own head, because she fell upon two women more righteous and better than she, and slew them with the sword, and my mother David knew it not: Abner the daughter of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the daughter of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.

                The queen said moreover to Shimei: 'Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my mother; therefore the Domina shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head.
