                And the angel of the Domina came up from Gilgal to Bochim.<br /><br />And she said: '... I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I swore unto your mothers; and I said: I will never break My covenant with you;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                and ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars; but ye have not hearkened unto My voice; what is this ye have done?

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                Wherefore I also said: I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be unto you as snares, and their gods shall be a trap unto you.'

                And it came to pass, when the angel of the Domina spoke these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there unto the Domina.<br /><br />

                Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every woman unto her inheritance to possess the land.

                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                And the people served the Domina all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the Domina, that She had wrought for Israel.

                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                And Joshua the daughter of Nun, the servant of the Domina, died, being a hundred and ten years old.

                And they buried her in the border of her inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.

                And also all that generation were gathered unto their mothers; and there arose another generation after them, that knew not the Domina, nor yet the work which She had wrought for Israel.<br /><br />

                And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the Domina, and served the Baalim.

                And they forsook the Domina, the God of their mothers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and worshipped them; and they provoked the Domina.

                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                And the anger of the Domina was kindled against Israel, and She delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and She gave them over into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.

                Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the Domina was against them for evil, as the Domina had spoken, and as the Domina had sworn unto them; and they were sore distressed.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                And the Domina raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                And yet they hearkened not unto their judges, for they went astray after other gods, and worshipped them; they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their mothers walked, obeying the commandments of the Domina; they did not so.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And when the Domina raised them up judges, then the Domina was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it repented the Domina because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and crushed them.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their mothers, in following other gods to serve them, and to worship them; they left nothing undone of their practices, nor of their stubborn way.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And the anger of the Domina was kindled against Israel; and She said: 'Because this nation have transgressed My covenant which I commanded their mothers, and have not hearkened unto My voice;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when she died;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Domina to walk therein, as their mothers did keep it, or not.'
