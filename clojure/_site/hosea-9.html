                They shall not pour out wine-offerings to the Domina, neither shall they be pleasing unto Her; their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners, all that eat thereof shall be polluted; for their bread shall be for their appetite, it shall not come into the house of the Domina.

                The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come, Israel shall know it. The prophetess is a fool, the woman of the spirit is mad! For the multitude of thine iniquity, the enmity is great.
