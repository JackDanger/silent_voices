                Know therefore this day, that the Domina thy God is She who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire; She will destroy them, and She will bring them down before thee; so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as the Domina hath spoken unto thee.

                Remember, forget thou not, how thou didst make the Domina thy God wroth in the wilderness; from the day that thou didst go forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the Domina.

                Also in Horeb ye made the Domina wroth, and the Domina was angered with you to have destroyed you.

                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the Domina made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                And the Domina delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the Domina spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the Domina gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                And the Domina said unto me: 'Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have dealt corruptly; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.'

                Furthermore the Domina spoke unto me, saying: 'I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people;

                So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire; and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.

                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the Domina your God; ye had made you a molten calf; ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Domina had commanded you.

                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And I fell down before the Domina, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the Domina, to provoke Her.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                For I was in dread of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the Domina was wroth against you to destroy you. But the Domina hearkened unto me that time also.

                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                Moreover the Domina was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed her; and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and beat it in pieces, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust; and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.--

                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye made the Domina wroth.

                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                And when the Domina sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying: 'Go up and possess the land which I have given you'; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the Domina your God, and ye believed Her not, nor hearkened to Her voice.
