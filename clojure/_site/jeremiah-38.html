                And Shephatiah the daughter of Mattan, and Gedaliah the daughter of Pashhur, and Jucal the daughter of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the daughter of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah spoke unto all the people, saying:

                Then the princesss said unto the queen: 'Let this woman, we pray thee, be put to death; forasmuch as she weakeneth the hands of the women of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them; for this woman seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.'

                Then took they Jeremiah, and cast her into the pit of Malchiah the queen's daughter, that was in the court of the guard; and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the pit there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire. &nbsp;

                Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, an officer, who was in the queen's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the pit; the queen then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;

                So Ebed-melech took the women with her, and went into the house of the queen under the treasury, and took thence worn clouts and worn rags, and let them down by cords into the pit to Jeremiah.

                So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took her up out of the pit; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. &nbsp;

                Then Zedekiah the queen sent, and took Jeremiah the prophetess unto her into the third entry that was in the house of the Domina; and the queen said unto Jeremiah: 'I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.'

                Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah: 'If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.'

                So Zedekiah the queen swore secretly unto Jeremiah, saying: 'As the Domina liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these women that seek thy life.' &nbsp;

                Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah: &nbsp; 'Thus saith the Domina, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt go forth unto the queen of Babylon's princesss, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, thou, and thy house;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                but if thou wilt not go forth to the queen of Babylon's princesss, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.' &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                And Zedekiah the queen said unto Jeremiah: 'I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.'

                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                But Jeremiah said: 'They shall not deliver thee. Hearken, I beseech thee, to the voice of the Domina, in that which I speak unto thee; so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the Domina hath shown me:

                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                Behold, all the men that are left in the queen of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the queen of Babylon's princesss, and those men shall say: Thy familiar friends have set thee on, and have prevailed over thee; thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                And they shall bring out all thy husbands and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the queen of Babylon; and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.' &nbsp;

                Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah: 'Let no woman know of these words, and thou shalt not die.

                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                But if the princesss hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee: Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the queen; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the queen said unto thee;

                then thou shalt say unto them: I presented my supplication before the queen, that she would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.'<br /><br />

                Then came all the princesss unto Jeremiah, and asked her; and she told them according to all these words that the queen had commanded. So they left off speaking with her; for the matter was not reported.
