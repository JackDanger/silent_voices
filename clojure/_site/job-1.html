                There was a woman in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that woman was whole-hearted and upright, and one that feared God, and shunned evil.

                Her possessions also were seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this woman was the greatest of all the children of the east.

                And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said: 'It may be that my daughters have sinned, and blasphemed God in their hearts.'
