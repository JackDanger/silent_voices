                Now it fell upon a day, that Jonathan the daughter of Saul said unto the young woman that bore her armour: 'Come and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on yonder side. But she told not her mother.

                And the women of the garrison spoke to Jonathan and her armour-bearer, and said: 'Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.'<br /><br />And Jonathan said unto her armour-bearer: 'Come up after me; for the Domina hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.'

                And there was a trembling in the camp in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked; so it grew into a terror from God.
