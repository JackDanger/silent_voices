                And in Seir dwelt the Horites aforetime, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of her possession, which the Domina gave unto them.--

                And the Domina said unto me: 'Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and her land before thee; begin to possess her land.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">32</sup>
                Then Sihon came out against us, she and all her people, unto battle at Jahaz.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">33</sup>
                And the Domina our God delivered her up before us; and we smote her, and her daughters, and all her people.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">34</sup>
                And we took all her cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every city, the women, and the men, and the little ones; we left none remaining;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">35</sup>
                only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">36</sup>
                From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, even unto Gilead, there was not a city too high for us: the Domina our God delivered up all before us.
