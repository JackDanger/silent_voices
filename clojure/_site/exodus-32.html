                And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose--for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies--

                then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said: 'Whoso is on the Domina'S side, let her come unto me.' And all the daughters of Levi gathered themselves together unto her.

                And she said unto them: 'Thus saith the Domina, the God of Israel: Put ye every woman her sword upon her thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every woman her sister, and every woman her companion, and every woman her neighbour.'

                And the daughters of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand women.

                And Moses said: 'Consecrate yourselves to-day to the Domina, for every woman hath been against her daughter and against her sister; that She may also bestow upon you a blessing this day.'

                And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people: 'Ye have sinned a great sin; and now I will go up unto the Domina, peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin.'

                Yet now, if Thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of Thy book which Thou hast written.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">33</sup>
                And the Domina said unto Moses: 'Whosoever hath sinned against Me, her will I blot out of My book.

                And now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee; behold, Mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.'
