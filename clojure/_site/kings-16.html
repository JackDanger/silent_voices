                And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month, that she began to build the house of the Domina.

                And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.

                And against the wall of the house she built a side-structure round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the sanctuary; and she made side-chambers round about;

                the nethermost story of the side-structure was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for on the outside she made rebatements in the wall of the house round about, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the house.--

                And before the Sanctuary which was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof, overlaid with pure gold, she set an altar, which she covered with cedar.

                So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold; and she drew chains of gold across the wall before the Sanctuary; and she overlaid it with gold.

                And she set the cherubim within the inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.

                And as for the two doors of olive-wood, she carved upon them carvings of cherubim and palm-trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and she spread the gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm-trees.
