                And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made her queen in the room of her mother Amaziah.

                In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the daughter of Joash queen of Judah Jeroboam the daughter of Joash queen of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.

                And she did that which was evil in the sight of the Domina; she departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the daughter of Nebat, wherewith she made Israel to sin.
