                After these things did queen Ahasuerus promote Haman the daughter of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced her, and set her seat above all the princesss that were with her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                And all the queen's servants, that were in the queen's gate, bowed down, and prostrated themselves before Haman; for the queen had so commanded concerning her. But Mordecai bowed not down, nor prostrated herself before her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                Then the queen's servants, that were in the queen's gate, said unto Mordecai: 'Why transgressest thou the queen's commandment?'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto her, and she hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's words would stand; for she had told them that she was a Jew.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not down, nor prostrated herself before her, then was Haman full of wrath.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                But it seemed contemptible in her eyes to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to her the people of Mordecai; wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of queen Ahasuerus, they cast pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. &nbsp;
              </span>

                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                And Haman said unto queen Ahasuerus: 'There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from those of every people; neither keep they the queen's laws; therefore it profiteth not the queen to suffer them.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                If it please the queen, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have the charge of the queen's business, to bring it into the queen's treasuries.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                And the queen took her ring from her hand, and gave it unto Haman the daughter of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And the queen said unto Haman: 'The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                Then were the queen's scribes called in the first month, on the thirteenth day thereof, and there was written, according to all that Haman commanded, unto the queen's satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princesss of every people; to every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of queen Ahasuerus was it written, and it was sealed with the queen's ring.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                And letters were sent by posts into all the queen's provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and men, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                The copy of the writing, to be given out for a decree in every province, was to be published unto all peoples, that they should be ready against that day.
