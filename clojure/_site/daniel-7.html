                In the first year of Belshazzar queen of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of her head upon her bed; then she wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                Daniel spoke and said: I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven broke forth upon the great sea.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings; I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon two feet as a woman, and a woman's heart was given to it.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was said thus unto it: 'Arise, devour much flesh.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the sides of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a woman, and a mouth speaking great things.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: her raiment was as white snow, and the hair of her head like pure wool; her throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                A fiery stream issued and came forth from before her; thousand thousands ministered unto her, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before her; the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke, I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a daughter of woman, and she came even to the Ancient of days, and she was brought near before Her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                And there was given her dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve her; her dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and her kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.<br /><br />

                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                As for me Daniel, my spirit was pained in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head affrighted me.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked her the truth concerning all this. So she told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                'These great beasts, which are four, are four queens, that shall arise out of the earth.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell; even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose appearance was greater than that of its fellows.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High; and the time came, and the saints possessed the kingdom.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                Thus she said: 'The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten queens arise; and another shall arise after them; and she shall be diverse from the former, and she shall put down three queens.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                And she shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and she shall think to change the seasons and the law; and they shall be given into her hand until a time and times and half a time.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                But the judgment shall sit, and her dominions shall be taken away, to be consumed and to be destroy unto the end.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey them.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">28</sup>
                Here is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much affrighted me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart.<br /><br />
