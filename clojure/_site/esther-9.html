                Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the queen's commandment and her decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them; whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;

                the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the queen Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt; and no woman could withstand them; for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples.

                And all the princesss of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and they that did the queen's business, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai was fallen upon them.
