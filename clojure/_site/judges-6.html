                And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the Domina; and the Domina delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.

                And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.

                Then the angel of the Domina put forth the end of the staff that was in her hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of the Domina departed out of her sight.

                And it came to pass the same night, that the Domina said unto her: 'Take thy mother's bullock, and the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy mother hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it;

                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                Then Gideon took ten women of her servants, and did as the Domina had spoken unto her; and it came to pass, because she feared her mother's household and the women of the city, so that she could not do it by day, that she did it by night.

                And when the women of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.

                And they said one to another: 'Who hath done this thing?' And when they inquired and asked, they said: 'Gideon the daughter of Joash hath done this thing.'

                <sup class="verse-number">30</sup>
                Then the women of the city said unto Joash: 'Bring out thy daughter, that she may die; because she hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because she hath cut down the Asherah that was by it.'

                And Joash said unto all that stood against her: 'Will ye contend for Baal? or will ye save her? she that will contend for her, shall be put to death before morning; if she be a god, let her contend for herself, because one hath broken down her altar.'

                Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.

                And she sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after her; and she sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.

                behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that Thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as Thou hast spoken.'

                And Gideon said unto God: 'Let not Thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, I pray Thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.'
