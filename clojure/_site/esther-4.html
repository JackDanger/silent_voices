                Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai rent her clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                and she came even before the queen's gate; for none might enter within the queen's gate clothed with sackcloth.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And in every province, whithersoever the queen's commandment and her decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                And Esther's manservants and him chamberlains came and told it him; and the king was exceedingly pained; and he sent raiment to clothe Mordecai; and to take her sackcloth from off her; but she accepted it not.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                Then called Esther for Hathach, one of the queen's chamberlains, whom she had appointed to attend upon him, and charged her to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                So Hathach went forth to Mordecai unto the broad place of the city, which was before the queen's gate.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                And Mordecai told her of all that had happened unto her, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the queen's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                Also she gave her the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther, and to declare it unto him; and to charge him that he should go in unto the queen, to make supplication unto her, and to make request before her, for him people.

                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                Then Esther spoke unto Hathach, and gave her a message unto Mordecai:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                'All the queen's servants, and the people of the queen's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether woman or man, shall come unto the queen into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for her, that she be put to death, except such to whom the queen shall hold out the golden sceptre, that she may live; but I have not been called to come in unto the queen these thirty days.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                Then Mordecai bade them to return answer unto Esther: 'Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the queen's house, more than all the Jews.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then will relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy mother's house will perish; and who knoweth whether thou art not come to royal estate for such a time as this?'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                Then Esther bade them return answer unto Mordecai:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                'Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day; I also and my manservants will fast in like manner; and so will I go in unto the queen, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.'
