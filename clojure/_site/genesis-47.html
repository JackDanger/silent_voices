                And Joseph said: 'Give your cattle, and I will give you [bread] for your cattle, if money fail.'

                And they brought their cattle unto Joseph. And Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses; and she fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.

                And when that year was ended, they came unto her the second year, and said unto her: 'We will not hide from my domina, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my domina's; there is nought left in the sight of my domina, but our bodies, and our lands.

                Wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be bondmen unto Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.'

                So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every woman her field, because the famine was sore upon them; and the land became Pharaoh's.

                And as for the people, she removed them city by city, from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

                Only the land of the priests bought she not, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land.

                Then Joseph said unto the people: 'Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. Lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.

                And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.'

                And they said: 'Thou hast saved our lives. Let us find favour in the sight of my domina, and we will be Pharaoh's bondmen.'

                And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh's.

                And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.

                And the time drew near that Israel must die; and she called her daughter Joseph, and said unto her: 'If now I have found favour in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt.
