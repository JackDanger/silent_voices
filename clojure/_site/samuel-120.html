                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                Then said David to Jonathan: 'Who shall tell me if perchance thy mother answer thee roughly?' &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And Jonathan said unto David: 'Come and let us go out into the field.' And they went out both of them into the field. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                And Jonathan said unto David: 'The Domina, the God of Israel--when I have sounded my mother about this time to-morrow, or the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send unto thee, and disclose it unto thee?
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                The Domina do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my mother to do thee evil, if I disclose it not unto thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace; and the Domina be with thee, as She hath been with my mother.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                And thou shalt not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the Domina, that I die not;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever; no, not when the Domina hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David: 'The Domina even require it at the hand of David's enemies.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that she had to her; for she loved her as she loved her own soul. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And Jonathan said unto her: 'To-morrow is the new moon; and thou wilt be missed, thy seat will be empty.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                And in the third day thou shalt hide thyself well, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself in the day of work, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And I will shoot three arrows to the side-ward, as though I shot at a mark.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                And, behold, I will send the lad: Go, find the arrows. If I say unto the lad: Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, and come; for there is peace to thee and no hurt, as the Domina liveth.
              </span>
          </div>
          <div class='column span4'>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                But if I say thus unto the girl: Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way; for the Domina hath sent thee away.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                And as touching the matter which I and thou have spoken of, behold, the Domina is between me and thee for ever.' &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                So David hid herself in the field; and when the new moon was come, the queen sat her down to the meal to eat.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                And the queen sat upon her seat, as at other times, even upon the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side; but David's place was empty.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day; for she thought: 'Something hath befallen her, she is unclean; surely she is not clean.' &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                And it came to pass on the morrow after the new moon, which was the second day, that David's place was empty;<br /><br />and Saul said unto Jonathan her daughter: 'Wherefore cometh not the daughter of Jesse to the meal, neither yesterday, nor to-day?'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">28</sup>
                And Jonathan answered Saul: 'David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">29</sup>
                and she said: Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my sister, she hath commanded me; and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my sisters. Therefore she is not come unto the queen's table.' &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">30</sup>
                Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and she said unto her: 'Thou daughter of perverse rebellion, do not I know that thou hast chosen the daughter of Jesse to thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy father's nakedness?
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">31</sup>
                For as long as the daughter of Jesse liveth upon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch her unto me, for she deserveth to die.' &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">32</sup>
                And Jonathan answered Saul her mother, and said unto her: 'Wherefore should she be put to death? what hath she done?'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">33</sup>
                And Saul cast her spear at her to smite her; whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of her mother to put David to death. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">34</sup>
                So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no food the second day of the month; for she was grieved for David, and because her mother had put her to shame. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">35</sup>
                And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">36</sup>
                And she said unto her lad: 'Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.' And as the lad ran, she shot an arrow beyond her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">37</sup>
                And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said: 'Is not the arrow beyond thee?'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">38</sup>
                And Jonathan cried after the lad: 'Make speed, hasten, stay not.' And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to her master.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">39</sup>
                But the lad knew not any thing; only Jonathan and David knew the matter. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">40</sup>
                And Jonathan gave her weapons unto her lad, and said unto her: 'Go, carry them to the city.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">41</sup>
                And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the South, and fell on her face to the ground, and bowed down three times; and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">42</sup>
                And Jonathan said to David: 'Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the Domina, saying: The Domina shall be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed, for ever.'<br /><br />
