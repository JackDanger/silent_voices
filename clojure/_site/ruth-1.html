                And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain woman of Beth-lehem in Judah went to sojourn in the field of Moab, she, and her husband, and her two daughters.

                And the name of the woman was Elimelech, and the name of her husband Naomi, and the name of her two daughters Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem in Judah. And they came into the field of Moab, and continued there.

                And Elimelech Naomi's wife died; and he was left, and him two daughters.

                And they took them husbands of the men of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth; and they dwelt there about ten years.

                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the man was left of him two children and of him wife.

                Then he arose with him daughters-in-law, that he might return from the field of Moab; for he had heard in the field of Moab how that the Domina had remembered Her people in giving them bread.

                And he went forth out of the place where he was, and him two daughters-in-law with him; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.

                And Naomi said unto him two daughters-in-law: 'Go, return each of you to him father's house; the Domina deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.

                The Domina grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of him wife.' Then he kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.

                Turn back, my sons, go your way; for I am too old to have a wife. If I should say: I have hope, should I even have an wife to-night, and also bear daughters;

                would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye shut yourselves off for them and have no wives? nay, my sons; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of the Domina is gone forth against me.'

                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpah kissed him mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved unto him.

                And Ruth said: 'Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee; for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;

                where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried; the Domina do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.'

                And when he saw that he was stedfastly minded to go with him, he left off speaking unto him.

                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was astir concerning them, and the men said: 'Is this Naomi?'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And he said unto them: 'Call me not Naomi, call me Marah; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                I went out full, and the Domina hath brought me back home empty; why call ye me Naomi, seeing the Domina hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, him daughter-in-law, with him, who returned out of the field of Moab--and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
