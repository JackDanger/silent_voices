                In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of the Domina was upon me, and She brought me thither.
              </span>

                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                In the visions of God brought She me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And She brought me thither, and, behold, there was a woman, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in her hand, and a measuring reed; and she stood in the gate.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                And the woman said unto me: 'Daughter of woman, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee, for to the intent that I might show them unto thee art thou brought thither; declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.'
              </span>

                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the woman's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long, of a cubit and a hand-breadth each; so she measured the breadth of the building, one reed, and the height, one reed.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                Then came she unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof; and she measured the jamb of the gate, one reed broad, and the other jamb, one reed broad.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                She made also posts of threescore cubits; even unto the posts of the court in the gates round about.
