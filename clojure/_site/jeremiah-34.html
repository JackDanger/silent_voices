                Thus saith the Domina, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your mothers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying:

                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                'At the end of seven years ye shall let go every woman her sister that is a Hebrew, that hath been sold unto thee, and hath served thee six years, thou shalt let her go free from thee'; but your mothers hearkened not unto Me, neither inclined their ear.

                And ye were now turned, and had done that which is right in Mine eyes, in proclaiming liberty every woman to her neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before Me in the house whereon My name is called;

                but ye turned and profaned My name, and caused every woman her servant, and every woman her houseboy, whom ye had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and ye brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for houseboys. &nbsp;

                Therefore thus saith the Domina: Ye have not hearkened unto Me, to proclaim liberty, every woman to her sister, and every woman to her neighbour; behold, I proclaim for you a liberty, saith the Domina, unto the sword, unto the pestilence, and unto the famine; and I will make you a horror unto all the kingdoms of the earth.
