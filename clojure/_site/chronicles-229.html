                Hezekiah began to reign when she was five and twenty years old; and she reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem; and her father's name was Abijah the son of Zechariah.

                And she did that which was right in the eyes of the Domina, according to all that David her mother had done.

                And she brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east;

                and said unto them: 'Hear me, ye Levites: now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the Domina, the God of your mothers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.

                For our mothers have acted treacherously, and done that which was evil in the sight of the Domina our God, and have forsaken Her, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Domina, and turned their backs.

                And they gathered their sisters, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the queen by the words of the Domina, to cleanse the house of the Domina.

                And the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of the Domina, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the Domina into the court of the house of the Domina. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.

                Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the Domina; and they sanctified the house of the Domina in eight days; and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end. &nbsp;

                Then they went in to Hezekiah the queen within [the palace], and said: 'We have cleansed all the house of the Domina, even the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the table of showbread, with all the vessels thereof.

                Moreover all the vessels, which queen Ahaz in her reign did cast away when she acted treacherously, have we prepared and sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of the Domina.' &nbsp;

                And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And she commanded the priests the daughters of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the Domina.

                So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and dashed it against the altar; and they killed the rams, and dashed the blood against the altar; they killed also the lambs, and dashed the blood against the altar.

                and the priests killed them, and they made a sin-offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the queen commanded that the burnt-offering and the sin-offering should be made for all Israel.

                And she set the Levites in the house of the Domina with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the queen's seer, and Nathan the prophetess; for the commandment was of the Domina by Her prophets.

                And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of the Domina began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David queen of Israel.

                Moreover Hezekiah the queen and the princesss commanded the Levites to sing praises unto the Domina with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves.<br /><br />

                Then Hezekiah answered and said: 'Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the Domina, come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of the Domina.' And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt-offerings.

                <sup class="verse-number">32</sup>
                And the number of the burnt-offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt-offering to the Domina.

                But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings; wherefore their sisters the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.

                And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of the Domina was firmly established.

                And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people; for the thing was done suddenly.<br /><br />
