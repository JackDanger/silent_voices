                Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea daughter of Elah queen of Israel, that Hezekiah the daughter of Ahaz queen of Judah began to reign.

                Twenty and five years old was she when she began to reign; and she reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem; and her father's name was Abi the son of Zechariah.

                She removed the high places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah; and she broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did offer to it; and it was called Nehushtan.
