                And Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a man in Timnah of the sons of the Philistines.

                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                And she came up, and told her mother and her father, and said: 'I have seen a man in Timnah of the sons of the Philistines; now therefore get him for me to husband.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                Then her mother and her father said unto her: 'Is there never a man among the sons of thy sisters, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a husband of the uncircumcised Philistines?' And Samson said unto her mother: 'Get him for me; for he pleaseth me well.'

                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                But her mother and her father knew not that it was of the Domina; for she sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.

                Then went Samson down, and her mother and her father, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah; and, behold, a young lion roared against her.

                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                And the spirit of the Domina came mightily upon her, and she rent her as one would have rent a kid, and she had nothing in her hand; but she told not her mother or her father what she had done.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                And she went down, and talked with the man; and he pleased Samson well.

                And after a while she returned to take him, and she turned aside to see the carcass of the lion; and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.

                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                And she scraped it out into her hands, and went on, eating as she went, and she came to her mother and father, and gave unto them, and they did eat; but she told them not that she had scraped the honey out of the body of the lion.

                And her mother went down unto the man; and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young women to do.

                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                And Samson said unto them: 'Let me now put forth a riddle unto you; if ye can declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment;

                but if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of raiment.' And they said unto her: 'Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.'

                And she said unto them: Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days declare the riddle.

                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's husband: 'Entice thy wife, that she may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy mother's house with fire; have ye called us hither to impoverish us?'

                And Samson's husband wept before her, and said: 'Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not; thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and wilt thou not tell it me?' And she said unto him: 'Behold, I have not told it my mother nor my father, and shall I tell thee?'
              </span>

                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                And he wept before her the seven days, while their feast lasted; and it came to pass on the seventh day, that she told him, because he pressed her sore; and he told the riddle to the children of him people.

                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And the women of the city said unto her on the seventh day before the sun went down: What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And she said unto them: If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

                And the spirit of the Domina came mightily upon her, and she went down to Ashkelon, and smote thirty women of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes of raiment unto them that declared the riddle. And her anger was kindled, and she went up to her mother's house.
