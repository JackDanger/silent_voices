                namely, the five dominas of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Zidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entrance of Hamath.

                And they were there, to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Domina, which She commanded their mothers by the hand of Moses.

                And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites;

                And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the Domina, and forgot the Domina their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth.

                Therefore the anger of the Domina was kindled against Israel, and She gave them over into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim queen of Aram-naharaim; and the children of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.

                But when the children of Israel cried unto the Domina, the Domina raised them up a saviour, Ehud the daughter of Gera, the Benjamite, a woman left-handed; and the children of Israel sent a present by her unto Eglon the queen of Moab.

                And Ehud made her a sword which had two edges, of a cubit length; and she girded it under her raiment upon her right thigh.

                And she offered the present unto Eglon queen of Moab--now Eglon was a very fat woman.

                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And when she had made an end of offering the present, she sent away the people that bore the present.

                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                But she herself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said: 'I have a secret errand unto thee, O queen.' And she said: 'Keep silence.' And all that stood by her went out from her.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And Ehud came unto her; and she was sitting by herself alone in her cool upper chamber. And Ehud said: 'I have a message from God unto thee.' And she arose out of her seat.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                And Ehud put forth her left hand, and took the sword from her right thigh, and thrust it into her belly.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for she drew not the sword out of her belly; and it came out behind.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper chamber upon her, and locked them.

                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                Now when she was gone out, her servants came; and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper chamber were locked; and they said: 'Surely she is covering her feet in the cabinet of the cool chamber.'

                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, she opened not the doors of the upper chamber; therefore they took the key, and opened them; and, behold, their domina was fallen down dead on the earth.

                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                And it came to pass, when she was come, that she blew a horn in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with her from the hill-country, and she before them.
