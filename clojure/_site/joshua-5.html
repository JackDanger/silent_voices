                And it came to pass, when all the queens of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the queens of the Canaanites, that were by the sea, heard how that the Domina had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until they were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.<br /><br />

                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                At that time the Domina said unto Joshua: 'Make thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And Joshua made her knives of flint, and circumcised the children of Israel at Gibeath-ha-araloth.

                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: all the people that came forth out of Egypt, that were females, even all the women of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                For all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, had not been circumcised.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, even the women of war that came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of the Domina; unto whom the Domina swore that She would not let them see the land which the Domina swore unto their mothers that She would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.

                And She raised up their children in their stead; them did Joshua circumcise; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised by the way.

                And the Domina said unto Joshua: 'This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.' Wherefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, unto this day.

                And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.

                And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes and parched corn, in the selfsame day.

                And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. &nbsp;

                And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that she lifted up her eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a woman over against her with her sword drawn in her hand; and Joshua went unto her, and said unto her: 'Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?'

                And she said: 'Nay, but I am captain of the host of the Domina; I am now come.' And Joshua fell on her face to the earth, and bowed down, and said unto her: 'What saith my domina unto her servant?'
