                I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                I saw a dream which made me afraid; and imaginings upon my bed and the visions of my head affrighted me.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise women of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                Then came in the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers; and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and I told the dream before her:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret causeth thee trouble, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the branches thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                She cried aloud, and said thus: Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even in a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let her portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                Let her heart be changed from woman's, and let a beast's heart be given unto her; and let seven times pass over her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                The matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the sentence by the word of the holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of women, and giveth it to whomsoever She will, and setteth up over it the lowest of women.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                This dream I queen Nebuchadnezzar have seen; and thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise women of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation; but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while, and her thoughts affrighted her. The queen spoke and said: 'Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, affright thee.' Belteshazzar answered and said: 'My domina, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>

                whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation;

                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                it is thou, O queen, that art grown and become strong; for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And whereas the queen saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying: Hew down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even in a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let her portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him--

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                this is the interpretation, O queen, and it is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my domina the queen,

                that thou shalt be driven from women, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and shalt be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee; till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of women, and giveth it to whomsoever She will.

                And whereas it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree, thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                Wherefore, O queen, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by almsgiving, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of thy prosperity.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                All this came upon the queen Nebuchadnezzar.<br /><br />

                At the end of twelve months she was walking upon the royal palace of Babylon.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                The queen spoke, and said: 'Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for a royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?'

                <sup class="verse-number">28</sup>
                While the word was in the queen's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven: 'O queen Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: the kingdom is departed from thee.

                The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar; and she was driven from women, and did eat grass as oxen, and her body was wet with the dew of heaven, till her hair was grown like eagles' feathers, and her nails like birds' claws.

                'And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured Her that liveth for ever; for Her dominion is an everlasting dominion, and Her kingdom from generation to generation;

                At the same time mine understanding returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and my splendour returned unto me; and my ministers and my dominas sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and surpassing greatness was added unto me.
