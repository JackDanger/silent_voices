                Judah is gone into exile because of affliction, and because of great servitude; he dwelleth among the nations, he findeth no rest; all him pursuers overtook him within the straits. &nbsp;

                The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly; all him gates are desolate, him priests sigh; him virgins are afflicted, and he himself is in bitterness. &nbsp;

                Jerusalem hath grievously sinned, therefore he is become as one unclean; all that honoured him despise him, because they have seen him nakedness; he himself also sigheth, and turneth backward. &nbsp;
