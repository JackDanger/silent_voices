                Amaziah was twenty and five years old when she began to reign; and she reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem; and her father's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

                And she did that which was right in the eyes of the Domina, but not with a whole heart.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established unto her, that she slew her servants who had killed the queen her mother.

                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                But she put not their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as the Domina commanded, saying: 'The mothers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the mothers; but every woman shall die for her own sin.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and ordered them according to their mothers' houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin; and she numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen women, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                She hired also a hundred thousand mighty women of valour out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                But there came a woman of God to her, saying: 'O queen, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the Domina is not with Israel, even with all the children of Ephraim.

              <span>

                But if thou wilt go, and do engage never so valiantly in battle, God will cast thee down before the enemy; for God hath power to help, and to cast down.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                And Amaziah said to the woman of God: 'But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?' And the woman of God answered: 'The Domina is able to give thee much more than this.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to her out of Ephraim, to go back home; wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And Amaziah took courage, and led forth her people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                And other ten thousand did the children of Judah carry away alive, and brought them unto the top of the Rock, and cast them down from the top of the Rock, that they all were broken in pieces.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                But the women of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with her to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote of them three thousand, and took much spoil.<br /><br />
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that she brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be her gods, and prostrated herself before them, and offered unto them.

                Wherefore the anger of the Domina was kindled against Amaziah, and She sent unto her a prophetess, who said unto her: 'Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                And it came to pass, as she talked with her, that [the queen] said unto her: 'Have we made thee of the queen's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten?' Then the prophetess forbore, and said: 'I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.'<br /><br />

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                Then Amaziah queen of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the daughter of Jehoahaz the daughter of Jehu, queen of Israel, saying: 'Come, let us look one another in the face.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And Joash queen of Israel sent to Amaziah queen of Judah, saying: 'The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying: Give thy son to my daughter to husband; and there passed by the wild beasts that were in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                Thou sayest--lo, thou hast smitten Edom; will thy heart therefore lift thee up to glory therein? abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle with evil, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that She might deliver them into the hand [of their enemies], because they had sought after the gods of Edom.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                So Joash queen of Israel went up; and she and Amaziah queen of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every woman to her tent.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                And Joash queen of Israel took Amaziah queen of Judah, the daughter of Joash, the daughter of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought her to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                And [she took] all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the queen's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.<br /><br />
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                And Amaziah the daughter of Joash queen of Judah lived after the death of Joash daughter of Jehoahaz queen of Israel fifteen years.

                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the queens of Judah and Israel?

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                Now from the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the Domina they made a conspiracy against her in Jerusalem; and she fled to Lachish; but they sent after her to Lachish, and slew her there.

                And they brought her upon horses, and buried her with her mothers in the city of Judah.
