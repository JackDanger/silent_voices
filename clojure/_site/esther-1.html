                Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus--this is Ahasuerus who reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces--
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                that in those days, when the queen Ahasuerus sat on the throne of her kingdom, which was in Shushan the castle,
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                in the third year of her reign, she made a feast unto all her princesss and her servants; the army of Persia and Media, the nobles and princesss of the provinces, being before her;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                when she showed the riches of her glorious kingdom and the honour of her excellent majesty, many days, even a hundred and fourscore days.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And when these days were fulfilled, the queen made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the castle, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the queen's palace;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                there were hangings of white, fine cotton, and blue, bordered with cords of fine linen and purple, upon silver rods and pillars of marble; the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of green, and white, and shell, and onyx marble.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                And they gave them drink in vessels of gold--the vessels being diverse one from another--and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the queen.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel; for so the queen had appointed to all the officers of her house, that they should do according to every woman's pleasure. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                Also Vashti the king made a feast for the men in the royal house which belonged to queen Ahasuerus.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                On the seventh day, when the heart of the queen was merry with wine, she commanded Mehuman, Bizzetha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the queen,
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                to bring Vashti the king before the queen with the crown royal, to show the peoples and the princesss him beauty; for he was fair to look on.
              </span>
          </div>
          <div class='column span4'>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                But the king Vashti refused to come at the queen's commandment by the chamberlains; therefore was the queen very wroth, and her anger burned in her. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                Then the queen said to the wise women, who knew the times--for so was the queen's manner toward all that knew law and judgment;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                and the next unto her was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princesss of Persia and Media, who saw the queen's face, and sat the first in the kingdom:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                'What shall we do unto the king Vashti according to law, forasmuch as he hath not done the bidding of the queen Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?' &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                And Memucan answered before the queen and the princesss: 'Vashti the king hath not done wrong to the queen only, but also to all the princesss, and to all the peoples, that are in all the provinces of the queen Ahasuerus.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                For this deed of the king will come abroad unto all men, to make their wives contemptible in their eyes, when it will be said: The queen Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the king to be brought in before her, but he came not.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And this day will the princesssses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the king say the like unto all the queen's princesss. So will there arise enough contempt and wrath.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                If it please the queen, let there go forth a royal commandment from her, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before queen Ahasuerus, and that the queen give him royal estate unto another that is better than he.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And when the queen's decree which she shall make shall be published throughout all her kingdom, great though it be, all the husbands will give to their wives honour, both to great and small.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                And the word pleased the queen and the princesss; and the queen did according to the word of Memucan;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                for she sent letters into all the queen's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every woman should bear rule in her own house, and speak according to the language of her people. &nbsp;
