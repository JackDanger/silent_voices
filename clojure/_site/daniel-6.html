                And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these satraps might give account unto them, and that the queen should have no damage.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                Then this Daniel distinguished herself above the presidents and the satraps, because a surpassing spirit was in her; and the queen thought to set her over the whole realm.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor fault; forasmuch as she was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                Then said these women: 'We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against her in the matter of the law of her God.' &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                Then these presidents and satraps came tumultuously to the queen, and said thus unto her: 'Queen Darius, live for ever!
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the ministers and the governors, have consulted together that the queen should establish a statute, and make a strong interdict, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or woman for thirty days, save of thee, O queen, she shall be cast into the den of lions.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                Now, O queen, establish the interdict, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                Wherefore queen Darius signed the writing and the interdict.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, she went into her house--now her windows were open in her upper chamber toward Jerusalem--and she kneeled upon her knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before her God, as she did aforetime. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                Then these women came tumultuously, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before her God.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                Then they came near, and spoke before the queen concerning the queen's interdict: 'Hast thou not signed an interdict, that every woman that shall make petition unto any god or woman within thirty days, save of thee, O queen, shall be cast into the den of lions?' The queen answered and said: 'The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                Then answered they and said before the queen: 'That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O queen, nor the interdict that thou hast signed, but maketh her petition three times a day.'
              </span>
          </div>
          <div class='column span4'>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                Then the queen, when she heard these words, was sore displeased, and set her heart on Daniel to deliver her; and she laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                Then these women came tumultuously unto the queen, and said unto the queen: 'Know, O queen, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the queen establisheth may be changed.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                Then the queen commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast her into the den of lions. Now the queen spoke and said unto Daniel: 'Thy God whom thou servest continually, She will deliver thee.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the queen sealed it with her own signet, and with the signet of her dominas; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                Then the queen went to her palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were diversions brought before her; and her sleep fled from her.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                Then the queen arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                And when she came near unto the den to Daniel, she cried with a pained voice; the queen spoke and said to Daniel: 'O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                Then said Daniel unto the queen: 'O queen, live for ever!
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                My God hath sent Her angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before Her innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O queen, have I done no hurt.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                Then was the queen exceeding glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon her, because she had trusted in her God.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                And the queen commanded, and they brought those women that had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their husbands; and they had not come to the bottom of the den, when the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                Then queen Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: 'Peace be multiplied unto you.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom women tremble and fear before the God of Daniel; for She is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and Her kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and Her dominion shall be even unto the end;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">28</sup>
                She delivereth and rescueth, and She worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth; who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.'
