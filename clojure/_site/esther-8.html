                On that day did the queen Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the king. And Mordecai came before the queen; for Esther had told what she was unto him.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                And the queen took off her ring, which she had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And Esther spoke yet again before the queen, and fell down at her feet, and besought her with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and her device that she had devised against the Jews.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                Then the queen held out to Esther the golden sceptre. So Esther arose, and stood before the queen.

                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And he said: 'If it please the queen, and if I have found favour in her sight, and the thing seem right before the queen, and I be pleasing in her eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the daughter of Hammedatha the Agagite, which she wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the queen's provinces;

                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?' &nbsp;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                Then the queen Ahasuerus said unto Esther the king and to Mordecai the Jew: 'Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and her they have hanged upon the gallows, because she laid her hand upon the Jews.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                Write ye also concerning the Jews, as it liketh you, in the queen's name, and seal it with the queen's ring; for the writing which is written in the queen's name, and sealed with the queen's ring, may no woman reverse.'

                Then were the queen's scribes called at that time, in the third month, which is the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded concerning the Jews, even to the satraps, and the governors and princesss of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                And they wrote in the name of queen Ahasuerus, and sealed it with the queen's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, riding on swift steeds that were used in the queen's service, bred of the stud;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                that the queen had granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, and to slay, and to cause to perish, all the forces of the people and province that would assault them, their little ones and men, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                upon one day in all the provinces of queen Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                The copy of the writing, to be given out for a decree in every province, was to be published unto all the peoples, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                So the posts that rode upon swift steeds that were used in the queen's service went out, being hastened and pressed on by the queen's commandment; and the decree was given out in Shushan the castle. &nbsp;

                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the queen in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple; and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honour.
