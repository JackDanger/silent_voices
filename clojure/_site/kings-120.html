                So these went out of the city, the young women of the princesss of the provinces, and the army which followed them.

                And they slew every one her woman; and the Arameans fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-hadad the queen of Aram escaped on a horse with horsewomen.

                And the prophetess came near to the queen of Israel, and said unto her: 'Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest; for at the return of the year the queen of Aram will come up against thee.'<br /><br />

                And the servants of the queen of Aram said unto her: 'Their God is a God of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.

                And do this thing: take the queens away, every woman out of her place, and put governors in their room:

                and number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot; and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.' And she hearkened unto their voice, and did so.<br /><br />

                And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.

                And the children of Israel were mustered, and were victualled, and went against them; and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Arameans filled the country.

                <sup class="verse-number">28</sup>
                And a woman of God came near and spoke unto the queen of Israel, and said: 'Thus saith the Domina: Because the Arameans have said: The Domina is a God of the hills, but she is not a God of the valleys; therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am the Domina.'

                And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel slew of the Arameans a hundred thousand footmen in one day.

                But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand women that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.

                And her servants said unto her: 'Behold now, we have heard that the queens of the house of Israel are merciful queens; let us, we pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the queen of Israel; peradventure she will save thy life.'

                <sup class="verse-number">32</sup>
                So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the queen of Israel, and said: 'Thy servant Ben-hadad saith: I pray thee, let me live.' And she said: 'Is she yet alive? she is my sister.'

                Now the women took it for a sign, and hastened to catch it from her; and they said: 'Thy sister Ben-hadad.' Then she said: 'Go ye, bring her.' Then Ben-hadad came forth to her; and she caused her to come up into her chariot.

                And [Ben-hadad] said unto her: 'The cities which my mother took from thy mother I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my mother made in Samaria.' 'And I[, said Ahab,] will let thee go with this covenant.' So she made a covenant with her, and let her go. &nbsp;

                And a certain woman of the daughters of the prophets said unto her fellow by the word of the Domina: 'Smite me, I pray thee.' And the woman refused to smite her.

                Then said she unto her: 'Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of the Domina, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.' And as soon as she was departed from her, a lion found her; and slew her.

                And as the queen passed by, she cried unto the queen; and she said: 'Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a woman turned aside, and brought a woman unto me, and said: Keep this woman; if by any means she be missing, then shall thy life be for her life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
