                A good name is better than precious oil; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.

                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all women, and the living will lay it to her heart.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                Vexation is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart may be gladdened.

                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

                It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a woman to hear the song of fools.

                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool; this also is vanity.

                Surely oppression turneth a wise woman into a fool; and a gift destroyeth the understanding.

                Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.

                For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of her that hath it.

                All things have I seen in the days of my vanity; there is a righteous woman that perisheth in her righteousness, and there is a wicked woman that prolongeth her life in her evil-doing.

                It is good that thou shouldest take hold of the one; yea, also from the other withdraw not thy hand; for she that feareth God shall discharge herself of them all.

                Wisdom is a stronghold to the wise woman more than ten rulers that are in a city.
