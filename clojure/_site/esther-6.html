                On that night could not the queen sleep; and she commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the queen.

                And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the queen's chamberlains, of those that kept the door, who had sought to lay hands on the queen Ahasuerus.

                And the queen said: 'What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this?' Then said the queen's servants that ministered unto her: 'There is nothing done for her.'

                And the queen said: 'Who is in the court?'--Now Haman was come into the outer court of the queen's house, to speak unto the queen to hang Mordecai on the gallows that she had prepared for her.--
