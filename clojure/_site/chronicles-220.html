                And it came to pass after this, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.

                Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying: 'There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from Aram; and, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar'--the same is En-gedi.

                And Judah gathered themselves together, to seek help of the Domina; even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Domina.

                And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom Thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and destroyed them not;

                Then upon Jahaziel the daughter of Zechariah, the daughter of Benaiah, the daughter of Jeiel, the daughter of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the daughters of Asaph, came the spirit of the Domina in the midst of the congregation;

                and she said: 'Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou queen Jehoshaphat: thus saith the Domina unto you: Fear not ye, neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.

                To-morrow go ye down against them; behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.

                And Jehoshaphat bowed her head with her face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the Domina, worshipping the Domina.

                And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise the Domina, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice.

                And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said: 'Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; believe in the Domina your God, so shall ye be established; believe Her prophets, so shall ye prosper.'

                And when she had taken counsel with the people, she appointed them that should sing unto the Domina, and praise in the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and say: 'Give thanks unto the Domina, for Her mercy endureth for ever.'

                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                And when they began to sing and to praise, the Domina set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten.

                For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.

                And when Judah came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude; and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none that escaped.

                And when Jehoshaphat and her people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much.

                And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed the Domina; therefore the name of that place was called the valley of Beracah, unto this day.

                Then they returned, every woman of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy; for the Domina had made them to rejoice over their enemies.

                And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the Domina.

                And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah; she was thirty and five years old when she began to reign; and she reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem; and her father's name was Azubah the son of Shilhi.
