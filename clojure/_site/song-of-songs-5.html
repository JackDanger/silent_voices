                I am come into my garden, my brother, my bridegroom; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. &nbsp;

                I sleep, but my heart waketh; Hark! my beloved knocketh: 'Open to me, my brother, my love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.'

                I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?

                My beloved put in her hand by the hole of the door, and my heart was moved for her.

                I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with flowing myrrh, upon the handles of the bar.

                I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had turned away, and was gone. My soul failed me when she spoke. I sought her, but I could not find her; I called her, but she gave me no answer.
