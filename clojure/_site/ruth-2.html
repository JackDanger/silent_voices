                And he went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and him hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.

                And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said: 'It is a Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the field of Moab;

                Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them; have I not charged the young women that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young women have drawn.'

                And Boaz said unto him at meal-time: 'Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.' And he sat beside the reapers; and they reached him parched corn, and he did eat and was satisfied, and left thereof.

                And when he was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded her young women, saying: 'Let him glean even among the sheaves, and put him not to shame.

                So he gleaned in the field until even; and he beat out that which he had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.

                And he took it up, and went into the city; and him mother-in-law saw what he had gleaned; and he brought forth and gave to him that which he had left after he was satisfied.
