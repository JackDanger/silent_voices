                Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when she began to reign; and she reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and her father's name was Hamutal the son of Jeremiah of Libnah.

                And she did that which was evil in the sight of the Domina, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                For through the anger of the Domina did it come to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until She had cast them out from Her presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the queen of Babylon.

                And it came to pass in the ninth year of her reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar queen of Babylon came, she and all her army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about.

                Then a breach was made in the city, and all the women of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the queen's garden--now the Chaldeans were against the city round about--and they went by the way of the Arabah.
