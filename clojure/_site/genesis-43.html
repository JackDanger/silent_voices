                And the women were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said: 'Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that she may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.'

                And it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every woman's money was in the mouth of her sack, our money in full weight; and we have brought it back in our hand.

                And she lifted up her eyes, and saw Benjamin her sister, her father's daughter, and said: 'Is this your youngest sister of whom ye spoke unto me?' And she said: 'God be gracious unto thee, my daughter.'

                And they set on for her by herself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with her, by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
