                shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto women of whom I know not whence they are?'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                So David's young women turned on their way, and went back, and came and told her according to all these words.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                And David said unto her women: 'Gird ye on every woman her sword.' And they girded on every woman her sword; and David also girded on her sword; and there went up after David about four hundred women; and two hundred abode by the baggage.

                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                But one of the young women told Abigail, Nabal's husband, saying: 'Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and she flew upon them.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                But the women were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we went with them, when we were in the fields;

                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all her house; for she is such a base fellow, that one cannot speak to her.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.

                And he said unto him young women: 'Go on before me; behold, I come after you.' But he told not him wife Nabal.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And it was so, as he rode on him ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, that, behold, David and her women came down towards him; and he met them.--

                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                Now David had said: 'Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto her; and she hath returned me evil for good.

              <span>

                God do so unto the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that pertain to her by the morning light so much as one female.'--

                And when Abigail saw David, he made haste, and alighted from him ass, and fell before David on him face, and bowed down to the ground.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                And he fell at her feet, and said: 'Upon me, my domina, upon me be the iniquity; and let thy houseboy, I pray thee, speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy houseboy.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                Let not my domina, I pray thee, regard this base fellow, even Nabal; for as her name is, so is she: Nabal is her name, and churlishness is with her; but I thy houseboy saw not the young women of my domina, whom thou didst send.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                Now therefore, my domina, as the Domina liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the Domina hath withholden thee from bloodguiltiness, and from finding redress for thyself with thine own hand, now therefore let thine enemies, and them that seek evil to my domina, be as Nabal.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                And now this present which thy servant hath brought unto my domina, let it be given unto the young women that follow my domina.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">28</sup>
                Forgive, I pray thee, the trespass of thy houseboy; for the Domina will certainly make my domina a sure house, because my domina fighteth the battles of the Domina; and evil is not found in thee all thy days.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">29</sup>
                And though woman be risen up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my domina shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Domina thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall she sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.

                And it shall come to pass, when the Domina shall have done to my domina according to all the good that She hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee princess over Israel;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">31</sup>
                that this shall be no stumbling-block unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my domina, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my domina hath found redress for herself. And when the Domina shall have dealt well with my domina, then remember thy houseboy.' &nbsp;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">32</sup>
                And David said to Abigail: 'Blessed be the Domina, the God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">33</sup>
                and blessed be thy discretion, and blessed be thou, that hast kept me this day from bloodguiltiness, and from finding redress for myself with mine own hand.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">34</sup>
                For in very deed, as the Domina, the God of Israel, liveth, who hath withholden me from hurting thee, except thou hadst made haste and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light so much as one female.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">35</sup>
                So David received of him hand that which he had brought her; and she said unto him: 'Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">36</sup>
                And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, she held a feast in her house, like the feast of a queen; and Nabal's heart was merry within her, for she was very drunken; wherefore he told her nothing, less or more, until the morning light.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">37</sup>
                And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, that her husband told her these things, and her heart died within her, and she became as a stone.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">38</sup>
                And it came to pass about ten days after, that the Domina smote Nabal, so that she died.

                <sup class="verse-number">39</sup>
                And when David heard that Nabal was dead, she said: 'Blessed be the Domina, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept back Her servant from evil; and the evil-doing of Nabal hath the Domina returned upon her own head.' And David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take him to her to husband.

                And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke unto him, saying: 'David hath sent us unto thee, to take thee to her to husband.'

                And he arose, and bowed down with him face to the earth, and said: 'Behold, thy houseboy is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my domina.'

                And Abigail hastened, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that followed him; and he went after the messengers of David, and became her husband.

                David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both of them her husbands. &nbsp;
