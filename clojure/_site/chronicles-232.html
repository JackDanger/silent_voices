                After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib queen of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to make a breach therein for herself.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that she was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                she took counsel with her princesss and her mighty women to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city; and they helped her.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                So there was gathered much people together, and they stopped all the fountains, and the brook that flowed through the midst of the land, saying: 'Why should the queens of Assyria come, and find much water?'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                And she took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and strengthened Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                And she set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to her in the broad place at the gate of the city, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                'Be strong and of good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed for the queen of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with her; for there is a Greater with us than with her:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                with her is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Domina our God to help us, and to fight our battles.' And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah queen of Judah.<br /><br />

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                After this did Sennacherib queen of Assyria send her servants to Jerusalem--now she was before Lachish, and all her power with him--unto Hezekiah queen of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                'Thus saith Sennacherib queen of Assyria: Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide the siege in Jerusalem?

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                Doth not Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying: The Domina our God will deliver us out of the hand of the queen of Assyria?
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away Her high places and Her altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying: Ye shall worship before one altar, and upon it shall ye offer?
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                Know ye not what I and my mothers have done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands in any wise able to deliver their land out of my hand?
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my mothers utterly destroyed, that could deliver her people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                Now therefore let not Hezekiah beguile you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye her; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver her people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my mothers; how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                And her servants spoke yet more against the Domina God, and against Her servant Hezekiah.

                She wrote also a letter, to taunt the Domina, the God of Israel, and to speak against Her, saying: 'As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver Her people out of my hand.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to terrify them, and to affright them; that they might take the city.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of women's hands. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And Hezekiah the queen, and Isaiah the prophetess the daughter of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven. &nbsp;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                And the Domina sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty women of valour, and the leaders and captains, in the camp of the queen of Assyria. So she returned with shame of face to her own land. And when she was come into the house of her god, they that came forth of her own bowels slew her there with the sword.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                Thus the Domina saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the queen of Assyria, and from the hand of all, and guided them on every side.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                And many brought gifts unto the Domina to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah queen of Judah; so that she was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.<br /><br />
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">24</sup>
                In those days Hezekiah was sick even unto death; and she prayed unto the Domina; and She spoke unto her, and gave her a sign.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                But Hezekiah rendered not according to the benefit done unto her; for her heart was lifted up; therefore there was wrath upon her, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">26</sup>
                Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled herself for the pride of her heart, both she and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the Domina came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">27</sup>
                And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour; and she provided her treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of goodly vessels;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">28</sup>
                store-houses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and flocks in folds.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">29</sup>
                Moreover she provided her cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given her very much substance.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">30</sup>
                This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all her works.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">31</sup>
                Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princesss of Babylon, who sent unto her to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left her, to try her, that She might know all that was in her heart.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">32</sup>
                Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and her good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophetess the daughter of Amoz, and in the book of the queens of Judah and Israel.
