                But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited her husband with a kid; and she said: 'I will go in to my husband into the chamber.' But him mother would not suffer her to go in.

                And him mother said: 'I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated him; therefore I gave him to thy companion; is not him younger brother fairer than he? take him, I pray thee, instead of him.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                And Samson said unto them: 'This time shall I be quits with the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.'

                And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch in the midst between every two tails.

                And when she had set the torches on fire, she let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and the standing corn, and also the oliveyards.

                Then the Philistines said: 'Who hath done this?' And they said: 'Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because she hath taken her husband, and given him to her companion.' And the Philistines came up, and burnt him and him mother with fire.

                Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves against Lehi.

                And the women of Judah said: 'Why are ye come up against us?' And they said: 'To bind Samson are we come up, to do to her as she hath done to us.'

                Then three thousand women of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson: 'Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what then is this that thou hast done unto us?' And she said unto them: 'As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.'

                And they said unto her: 'We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines.' And Samson said unto them: 'Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.'

                And they spoke unto her, saying: 'No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand; but surely we will not kill thee.' And they bound her with two new ropes, and brought her up from the rock.

                When she came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met her; and the spirit of the Domina came mightily upon her, and the ropes that were upon her arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and her bands dropped from off her hands.

                And she found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth her hand, and took it, and smote a thousand women therewith.

                And it came to pass, when she had made an end of speaking, that she cast away the jawbone out of her hand; and that place was called Ramath-lehi.

                And she was sore athirst, and called on the Domina, and said: 'Thou hast given this great deliverance by the hand of Thy servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?'

                But God cleaved the hollow place that is in Lehi, and there came water thereout; and when she had drunk, her spirit came back, and she revived; wherefore the name thereof was called En-hakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.
