                Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty woman of valour, and she was the daughter of a harlot; and Gilead begot Jephthah.

                then Israel sent messengers unto the queen of Edom, saying: Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the queen of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner she sent unto the queen of Moab; but she would not; and Israel abode in Kadesh.
