                Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek queen of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as she had done to Jericho and him queen, so she had done to Ai and him queen; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the women thereof were mighty.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                Wherefore Adoni-zedek queen of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham queen of Hebron, and unto Piram queen of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia queen of Lachish, and unto Debir queen of Eglon, saying:
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                'Come up unto me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">5</sup>
                Therefore the five queens of the Amorites, the queen of Jerusalem, the queen of Hebron, the queen of Jarmuth, the queen of Lachish, the queen of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                And the women of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying: 'Slack not thy hands from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the queens of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered together against us.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                So Joshua went up from Gilgal, she, and all the people of war with her, and all the mighty women of valour.<br /><br />

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">8</sup>
                And the Domina said unto Joshua: 'Fear them not; for I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a woman of them stand against thee.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">9</sup>
                Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly; for she went up from Gilgal all the night.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">10</sup>
                And the Domina discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon; and they chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">11</sup>
                And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, that the Domina cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died; they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword. &nbsp;
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                Then spoke Joshua to the Domina in the day when the Domina delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel; and she said in the sight of Israel: 'Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Domina hearkened unto the voice of a woman; for the Domina fought for Israel. &nbsp;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                And Joshua returned, and all Israel with her, unto the camp to Gilgal.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">16</sup>
                And these five queens fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                And it was told Joshua, saying: 'The five queens are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.'
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">18</sup>
                And Joshua said: 'Roll great stones unto the mouth of the cave, and set women by it to keep them;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                but stay not ye; pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities; for the Domina your God hath delivered them into your hand.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace; none whetted her tongue against any of the children of Israel.

                Then said Joshua: 'Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five queens unto me out of the cave.'

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                And they did so, and brought forth those five queens unto her out of the cave, the queen of Jerusalem, the queen of Hebron, the queen of Jarmuth, the queen of Lachish, the queen of Eglon.

                And it came to pass, when they brought forth those queens unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the women of Israel, and said unto the chiefs of the women of war that went with her: 'Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these queens.' And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">25</sup>
                And Joshua said unto them: 'Fear not, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage; for thus shall the Domina do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.'

                And afterward Joshua smote them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees; and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
