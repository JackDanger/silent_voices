                And there was a certain woman of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and her husband was barren, and bore not.

                And the angel of the Domina appeared unto the man, and said unto him: 'Behold now, thou art barren, and hast not borne; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a daughter.
