                Belshazzar the queen made a great feast to a thousand of her dominas, and drank wine before the thousand.

                <sup class="verse-number">2</sup>
                Belshazzar, while she tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar her mother had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the queen and her dominas, her consorts and her concubines, might drink therein.
              </span>
              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">3</sup>
                Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the queen, and her dominas, her consorts and her concubines, drank in them.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">4</sup>
                They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.

                In the same hour came forth fingers of a woman's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the queen's palace; and the queen saw the palm of the hand that wrote.

                <sup class="verse-number">6</sup>
                Then the queen's countenance was changed in her, and her thoughts affrighted her; and the joints of her loins were loosed, and her knees smote one against another.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">7</sup>
                The queen cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers. The queen spoke and said to the wise women of Babylon: 'Whosoever shall read this writing, and declare unto me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about her neck, and shall rule as one of three in the kingdom.' &nbsp;

                Then came in all the queen's wise women: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the queen the interpretation.

                Then was queen Belshazzar greatly affrighted, and her countenance was changed in her, and her dominas were perplexed.

                Now the king by reason of the words of the queen and her dominas came into the banquet house; the king spoke and said: 'O queen, live for ever! let not thy thoughts affright thee, nor let thy countenance be changed;

                there is a woman in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy mother light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in her; and the queen Nebuchadnezzar thy mother, the queen, I say, thy mother, made her master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">12</sup>
                forasmuch as a surpassing spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and declaring of riddles, and loosing of knots, were found in the same Daniel, whom the queen named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and she will declare the interpretation.'<br /><br />

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">13</sup>
                Then was Daniel brought in before the queen. The queen spoke and said unto Daniel: 'Art thou Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the queen my mother brought out of Judah?

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">14</sup>
                I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and surpassing wisdom is found in thee.

                <sup class="verse-number">15</sup>
                And now the wise women, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but they could not declare the interpretation of the thing.

                But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and loose knots; now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt rule as one of three in the kingdom.'<br /><br />

                <sup class="verse-number">17</sup>
                Then Daniel answered and said before the queen: 'Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the queen, and make known to her the interpretation.

                O thou queen, God Most High gave Nebuchadnezzar thy mother the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">19</sup>
                and because of the greatness that She gave her, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before her: whom she would she slew, and whom she would she kept alive; and whom she would she raised up, and whom she would she put down.

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">20</sup>
                But when her heart was lifted up, and her spirit was hardened that she dealt proudly, she was deposed from her kingly throne, and her glory was taken from her;

              <span>
                <sup class="verse-number">21</sup>
                and she was driven from the daughters of women, and her heart was made like the beasts, and her dwelling was with the wild asses; she was fed with grass like oxen, and her body was wet with the dew of heaven; until she knew that God Most High ruleth in the kingdom of women, and that She setteth up over it whomsoever She will.

                <sup class="verse-number">22</sup>
                And thou her daughter, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though thou knewest all this;

                <sup class="verse-number">23</sup>
                but hast lifted up thyself against the Domina of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of Her house before thee, and thou and thy dominas, thy consorts and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified;

                then was the palm of the hand sent from before Her, and this writing was inscribed.
