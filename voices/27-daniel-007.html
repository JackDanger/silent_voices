<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>In the first year of Belshazzar queen of Babylon Danielle
        had a dream and visions of her head on her bed:
        then she wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Danielle spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold,
        the four winds of the sky broke forth on the great sea.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Four great animals came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings:
        I saw until the wings of it were plucked, and it was lifted
        up from the earth, and made to stand on two feet as a woman;
        and a woman's heart was given to it.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Behold, another animal, a second, like a bear; and it was raised up
        on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth:
        and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, which had
        on its back four wings of a bird; the animal had also four heads;
        and dominion was given to it.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>After this I saw in the night visions, and, behold, a fourth
        animal, awesome and powerful, and strong exceedingly;
        and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke
        in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet:
        and it was diverse from all the animals that were before it;
        and it had ten horns.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among
        them another horn, a little one, before which three
        of the first horns were plucked up by the roots:
        and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a woman,
        and a mouth speaking great things.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I saw until thrones were placed, and one who was ancient of days sat:
        her clothing was white as snow, and the hair of her head
        like pure wool; her throne was fiery flames, and the wheels
        of it burning fire.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before her:
        thousands of thousands ministered to her, and ten thousand
        times ten thousand stood before her:  the judgment was set,
        and the books were opened.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words
        which the horn spoke; I saw even until the animal was slain,
        and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>As for the rest of the animals, their dominion was taken away:
        yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds
        of the sky one like a daughter of woman, and she came even to the ancient
        of days, and they brought her near before her.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>There was given her dominion, and glory, and a queendom,
        that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve her:
        her dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away,
        and her queendom that which shall not be destroyed.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>As for me, Danielle, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body,
        and the visions of my head troubled me.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked her
        the truth concerning all this.  So she told me, and made me
        know the interpretation of the things.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>These great animals, which are four, are four queens, who shall
        arise out of the earth.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But the saints of the Most High shall receive the queendom,

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal,
        which was diverse from all of them, exceedingly terrible,
        whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured,
        broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='020' href='#020'>020</a></div>
<div class='content text'>and concerning the ten horns that were on its head,
        and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell,
        even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things,
        whose look was more stout than its fellows.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='021' href='#021'>021</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I saw, and the same horn made war with the saints,
        and prevailed against them;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='022' href='#022'>022</a></div>
<div class='content text'>until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to
        the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints
        possessed the queendom.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='023' href='#023'>023</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Thus she said, The fourth animal shall be a fourth queendom
        on earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms,
        and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down,
        and break it in pieces.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='024' href='#024'>024</a></div>
<div class='content text'>As for the ten horns, out of this queendom shall ten queens arise:
        and another shall arise after them; and she shall be diverse
        from the former, and she shall put down three queens.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='025' href='#025'>025</a></div>
<div class='content text'>She shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear
        out the saints of the Most High; and she shall think to change
        the times and the law; and they shall be given into her hand

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='027' href='#027'>027</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The queendom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms
        under the whole sky, shall be given to the people of the saints
        of the Most High:  her queendom is an everlasting queendom,

<div class='anchor number'><a name='028' href='#028'>028</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Here is the end of the matter.  As for me, Danielle, my thoughts
