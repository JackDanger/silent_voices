<div class='content text'>Shephatiah the daughter of Mattan, and Gedaliah the daughter of Pashhur,
        and Jucal the daughter of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the daughter of Malchijah,
        heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people, saying,

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Thus says Yahweh, She who remains in this city shall die
        by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;
        but she who goes forth to the Chaldeans shall live, and hers
        life shall be to her for a prey, and she shall live.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Thus says Yahweh, This city shall surely be given into the hand
        of the army of the queen of Babylon, and she shall take it.
</div>

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then the princesses said to the queen, Let this woman, we pray you,
        be put to death; because she weakens the hands of the women of war
        who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people,
        in speaking such words to them:  for this woman doesn't seek
        the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Zedekiah the queen said, Behold, she is in your hand;
        for the queen is not she who can do anything against you.
</div>

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then took they Jeremiah, and cast her into the dungeon of
        Malchijah the queen's daughter, that was in the court of the guard:
        and they let down Jeremiah with cords.  In the dungeon there
        was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the
        queen's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon
        (the queen then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Ebedmelech went forth out of the queen's house, and spoke
        to the queen, saying,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>My lord the queen, these women have done evil in all that they
        have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into
        the dungeon; and she is likely to die in the place where she is,
        because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then the queen commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying,
        Take from hence thirty women with you, and take up Jeremiah
        the prophet out of the dungeon, before she dies.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So Ebedmelech took the women with her, and went into the house
        of the queen under the treasury, and took there rags
        and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into
        the dungeon to Jeremiah.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these rags
        and worn-out garments under your armholes under the cords.
        Jeremiah did so.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took her up

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then Zedekiah the queen sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet
        to her into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh:
        and the queen said to Jeremiah, I will ask you a thing;
        hide nothing from me.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you,
        will you not surely put me to death? and if I give you counsel,
        you will not listen to me.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So Zedekiah the queen swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying,
        As Yahweh lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you
        to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these women
        who seek your life.

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus says Yahweh, the God
        of Armies, the God of Israel:  If you will go forth to the queen
        of Babylon's princesses, then your soul shall live, and this
        city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live,
        and your house.

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Zedekiah the queen said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews
        who are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me
        into their hand, and they mock me.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='020' href='#020'>020</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you.  Obey, I beg you,
        the voice of Yahweh, in that which I speak to you:
        so it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='021' href='#021'>021</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that Yahweh
        has shown me:

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='022' href='#022'>022</a></div>
<div class='content text'>behold, all the men who are left in the queen of Judah's house
        shall be brought forth to the queen of Babylon's princesses,
        and those men shall say, Your familiar friends have set you on,
        and have prevailed over you:  now that your feet are sunk
        in the mire, they are turned away back.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='023' href='#023'>023</a></div>
<div class='content text'>They shall bring out all your husbands and your children to
        the Chaldeans; and you shall not escape out of their hand,

        and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='024' href='#024'>024</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no woman know of these words,

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='025' href='#025'>025</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But if the princesses hear that I have talked with you, and they
        come to you, and tell you, Declare to us now what you have said
        to the queen; don't hide it from us, and we will not put you
        to death; also what the queen said to you:
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='026' href='#026'>026</a></div>
<div class='content text'>then you shall tell them, I presented my supplication before the queen,

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='027' href='#027'>027</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then came all the princesses to Jeremiah, and asked her;
        and she told them according to all these words that the queen
        had commanded.  So they left off speaking with her;
        for the matter was not perceived.
