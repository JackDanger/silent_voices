<div class='content text'>The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn't yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing;</div>

<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, she took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='025' href='#025'>025</a></div>

<div class='anchor number'><a name='026' href='#026'>026</a></div>
<div class='content text'>or else she must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the ages, she has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of herelf.</div>
