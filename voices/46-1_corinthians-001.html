</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='021' href='#021'>021</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='023' href='#023'>023</a></div>

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='027' href='#027'>027</a></div>
<div class='content text'>but God chose the foolish things of the world that she might put

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='028' href='#028'>028</a></div>
