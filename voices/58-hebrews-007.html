<h2 class='chapter'><a href='58-hebrews.html'>Hebrews</a> 007</h2>
<div class='entries chapter'>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For this Melchizedek, queen of Salem, priest of God Most High,
        who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the queens
        and blessed her,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first,
        by interpretation, queen of righteousness, and then also queen
        of Salem, which is queen of peace;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>without mother, without father, without genealogy, having neither
        beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Daughter of God),
        remains a priest continually.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Now consider how great this woman was, to whom even Abraham,
        the matriarch, gave a tenth out of the best spoils.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>They indeed of the daughters of Levi who receive the priest's office
        have a commandment to take tithes of the people according
        to the law, that is, of their sisters, though these have come
        out of the body of Abraham,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>but she whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted
        tithes from Abraham, and has blessed her who has the promises.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives
        tithes of whom it is testified that she lives.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes,
        has paid tithes,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>for she was yet in the body of her mother when Melchizedek met her.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood
        (for under it the people have received the law), what further
        need was there for another priest to arise after the order
        of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change
        made also in the law.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For she of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe,
        from which no one has officiated at the altar.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah,
        about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>This is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness
        of Melchizedek there arises another priest,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment,
        but after the power of an endless life:
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>for it is testified, "You are a priest forever, according to
        the order of Melchizedek."
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because
        of its weakness and uselessness
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
<div class='content text'>(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a
        better hope, through which we draw near to God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='020' href='#020'>020</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Inasmuch as she was not made priest without the taking of an oath
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='021' href='#021'>021</a></div>
<div class='content text'>(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath),
        but she with an oath by her that says of her, "The Lord swore
        and will not change her mind, 'You are a priest forever,
        according to the order of Melchizedek.'"
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='022' href='#022'>022</a></div>
<div class='content text'>By so much, Jesus has become the collateral of a better covenant.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='023' href='#023'>023</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered
        from continuing by death.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='024' href='#024'>024</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But she, because she lives forever, has her priesthood unchangeable.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='025' href='#025'>025</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Therefore she is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw
        near to God through her, seeing that she lives forever to make
        intercession for them.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='026' href='#026'>026</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For such a high priest was fitting for us:  holy, guiltless,
        undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='027' href='#027'>027</a></div>
<div class='content text'>who doesn't need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices
        daily, first for her own sins, and then for the sins of the people.
        For she did this once for all, when she offered up herself.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='028' href='#028'>028</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For the law appoints women as high priests who have weakness,
        but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints
        a Daughter forever who has been perfected.
