<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Moreover, sisters, we make known to you the grace of God
        which has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy
        and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For according to their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power,
        they gave of their own accord,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and
        the fellowship in the service to the saints.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>This was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own
        selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So we urged Titus, that as she made a beginning before,
        so she would also complete in you this grace.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge,
        all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that you also
        abound in this grace.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through
        the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that,
        though she was rich, yet for your sakes she became poor,
        that you through her poverty might become rich.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I give a judgment in this:  for this is expedient for you,
        who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do,
        but also to be willing.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But now complete the doing also, that as there was the readiness
        to be willing, so there may be the completion also out
        of your ability.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according
        to what you have, not according to what you don't have.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>but for equality.  Your abundance at this present time supplies
        their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply
        for your lack; that there may be equality.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>As it is written, "She who gathered much had nothing left over,
        and she who gathered little had no lack."
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you
        into the heart of Titus.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For she indeed accepted our exhortation, but being herself
        very earnest, she went out to you of her own accord.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>We have sent together with her the sister whose praise
        in the Good News is known through all the assemblies.

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies
        to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us
        to the glory of the Lord herself, and to show our readiness.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='020' href='#020'>020</a></div>
<div class='content text'>We are avoiding this, that any woman should blame us concerning
        this abundance which is administered by us.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='021' href='#021'>021</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='022' href='#022'>022</a></div>
<div class='content text'>We have sent with them our sister, whom we have many times
        proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest,
        by reason of the great confidence which she has in you.
</div>

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='023' href='#023'>023</a></div>
<div class='content text'>As for Titus, she is my partner and fellow worker for you.
        As for our sisters, they are the apostles of the assemblies,
        the glory of Christ.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='024' href='#024'>024</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front
        of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf.
