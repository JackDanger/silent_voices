        against their sisters the Jews.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For there were that said, We, our daughters and our sons, are many:
        let us get grain, that we may eat and live.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields,
        and our vineyards, and our houses:  let us get grain,
        because of the dearth.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the queen's

<div class='content text'>Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our sisters, our children
        as their children:  and behold, we bring into bondage our daughters
        and our sons to be servants, and some of our sons
        are brought into bondage already: neither is it in our power
        to help it; for other women have our fields and our vineyards.

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles
        and the rulers, and said to them, You exact usury, everyone of
        her sister.  I held a great assembly against them.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our sisters
        the Jews, that were sold to the nations; and would you
        even sell your sisters, and should they be sold to us?
        Then held they their peace, and found never a word.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Also I said, The thing that you do is not good:  ought you
        not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach
        of the nations our enemies?

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I likewise, my sisters and my servants, do lend them money

<div class='content text'>Please restore to them, even this day, their fields,

<div class='content text'>Then said they, We will restore them, and will require
        nothing of them; so will we do, even as you say.
        Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them,
        that they would do according to this promise.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every woman
        from her house, and from her labor, that doesn't perform
        this promise; even thus be she shaken out, and emptied.
        All the assembly said, Amen, and praised Yahweh.
        The people did according to this promise.

        the bread of the governor.

<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But the former governors who were before me were chargeable to
        the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels
        of silver; yes, even their servants bore rule over the people:
        but I didn't do so, because of the fear of God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought
        we any land:  and all my servants were gathered there
        to the work.
</div>
