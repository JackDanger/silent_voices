<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The gift is not as through one who sinned: for the judgment came by one to condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification.</div>

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>

<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
