<div class='content text'>For Zedekiah queen of Judah had shut her up, saying, Why do
        you prophesy, and say, Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will
        give this city into the hand of the queen of Babylon,
        and she shall take it;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>and Zedekiah queen of Judah shall not escape out of the hand
        of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand
        of the queen of Babylon, and shall speak with her mouth to mouth,
        and her eyes shall see her eyes;

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>and she shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall she be until
