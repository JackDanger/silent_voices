<div class='content text'>Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great
        a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin
        which so easily entangles us, and let us run with patience
        the race that is set before us,

        who for the joy that was set before her endured the cross,
        despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand
        of the throne of God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>

        as with children, "My daughter, don't take lightly the chastening
        of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by her;

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>It is for discipline that you endure.  God deals with
        you as with children, for what daughter is there whom hers
        mother doesn't discipline?

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous;
