<h2 class='chapter'>Romans 007</h2>
<div class='entries chapter'>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Or don't you know, brothers{The word for "sisters"
        here and where context allows may also be correctly translated
        "sisters and brothers" or "siblings."} (for I speak to women
        who know the law), that the law has dominion over a woman
        for as long as she lives?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For the man that has a wife is bound by law to the wife
        while she lives, but if the wife dies, he is discharged
        from the law of the wife.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So then if, while the wife lives, he is joined to another woman,
        he would be called an adulteress.  But if the wife dies,
        he is free from the law, so that he is no adulteress,
        though he is joined to another woman.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Therefore, my sisters, you also were made dead to the law
        through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another,
        to her who was raised from the dead, that we might bring
        forth fruit to God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which
        were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth
        fruit to death.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But now we have been discharged from the law, having died
        to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness
        of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>What shall we say then?  Is the law sin?  May it never be!
        However, I wouldn't have known sin, except through the law.
        For I wouldn't have known coveting, unless the law had said,
        "You shall not covet."
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But sin, finding occasion through the commandment,
        produced in me all kinds of coveting.  For apart from the law,
        sin is dead.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came,
        sin revived, and I died.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The commandment, which was for life, this I found to be for death;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>for sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me,
        and through it killed me.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy,
        and righteous, and good.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Did then that which is good become death to me?  May it never be!
        But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death
        to me through that which is good; that through the commandment
        sin might become exceeding sinful.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly,
        sold under sin.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For I don't know what I am doing.  For I don't practice what I
        desire to do; but what I hate, that I do.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But if what I don't desire, that I do, I consent to the law
        that it is good.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing.
        For desire is present with me, but I don't find it doing
        that which is good.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For the good which I desire, I don't do; but the evil which I
        don't desire, that I practice.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='020' href='#020'>020</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But if what I don't desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it,
        but sin which dwells in me.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='021' href='#021'>021</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good,
        evil is present.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='022' href='#022'>022</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For I delight in God's law after the inward woman,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='023' href='#023'>023</a></div>
<div class='content text'>but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law
        of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law
        of sin which is in my members.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='024' href='#024'>024</a></div>
<div class='content text'>What a wretched woman I am!  Who will deliver me out of the body
        of this death?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='025' href='#025'>025</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord!  So then with the mind,
        I myself serve God's law, but with the flesh, the sin's law.
