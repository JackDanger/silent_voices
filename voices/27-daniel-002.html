<div class='content text'>In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar
        dreamed dreams; and her spirit was troubled, and her sleep
        went from her.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then the queen commanded to call the magicians, and the enchanters,
        and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell the queen her dreams.
        So they came in and stood before the queen.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The queen said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit
        is troubled to know the dream.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then spoke the Chaldeans to the queen in the Syrian language,
        O queen, live forever:  tell your servants the dream, and we
        will show the interpretation.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The queen answered the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me:
        if you don't make known to me the dream and the interpretation
        of it, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall
        be made a dunghill.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But if you show the dream and the interpretation of it,
        you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor:
        therefore show me the dream and the interpretation of it.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>They answered the second time and said, Let the queen tell

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The queen answered, I know of a certainty that you would gain time,

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But if you don't make known to me the dream, there is but
        one law for you; for you have prepared lying and corrupt
        words to speak before me, until the time be changed:
        therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can
        show me the interpretation of it.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The Chaldeans answered before the queen, and said, There is
        not a woman on the earth who can show the queen's matter,
        because no queen, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing
        of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>It is a rare thing that the queen requires, and there is no

<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For this cause the queen was angry and very furious, and commanded

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So the decree went forth, and the wise women were to be slain;
        and they sought Danielle and her companions to be slain.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then Danielle returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch
        the captain of the queen's guard, who was gone forth to kill
        the wise women of Babylon;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>she answered Arioch the queen's captain, Why is the decree so urgent

<div class='content text'>Danielle went in, and desired of the queen that she would appoint

<div class='content text'>Then Danielle went to her house, and made the thing known
        to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, her companions:
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning
        this secret; that Danielle and her companions should not perish

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then was the secret revealed to Danielle in a vision of the night.
        Then Danielle blessed the God of heaven.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='020' href='#020'>020</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Danielle answered, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever;

<div class='anchor number'><a name='021' href='#021'>021</a></div>
<div class='content text'>She changes the times and the seasons; she removes queens,

<div class='anchor number'><a name='022' href='#022'>022</a></div>
<div class='content text'>she reveals the deep and secret things; she knows what is in

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='023' href='#023'>023</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I thank you, and praise you, you God of my mothers,
        who have given me wisdom and might, and have now made known
        to me what we desired of you; for you have made known to us
        the queen's matter.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='024' href='#024'>024</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Therefore Danielle went in to Arioch, whom the queen had appointed
        to destroy the wise women of Babylon; she went and said thus to her:
        Don't destroy the wise women of Babylon; bring me in before
        the queen, and I will show to the queen the interpretation.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='025' href='#025'>025</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then Arioch brought in Danielle before the queen in haste, and said
        thus to her, I have found a woman of the children of the captivity
        of Judah, who will make known to the queen the interpretation.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='026' href='#026'>026</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The queen answered Danielle, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='027' href='#027'>027</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Danielle answered before the queen, and said, The secret which the queen
        has demanded can neither wise women, enchanters, magicians,
        nor soothsayers, show to the queen;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='028' href='#028'>028</a></div>
<div class='content text'>but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and she has made
        known to the queen Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days.
        Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these:
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='029' href='#029'>029</a></div>
<div class='content text'>as for you, O queen, your thoughts came into your mind on
        your bed, what should happen hereafter; and she who reveals
        secrets has made known to you what shall happen.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='030' href='#030'>030</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any
        wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent
        that the interpretation may be made known to the queen,
        and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='031' href='#031'>031</a></div>
<div class='content text'>You, O queen, saw, and behold, a great image.  This image,
        which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent,
        stood before you; and the aspect of it was awesome.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='032' href='#032'>032</a></div>
<div class='content text'>As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='033' href='#033'>033</a></div>
<div class='content text'>its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='034' href='#034'>034</a></div>
<div class='content text'>You saw until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck
        the image on its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke
        them in pieces.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='035' href='#035'>035</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver,
        and the gold, broken in pieces together, and became like
        the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind
        carried them away, so that no place was found for them:
        and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain,
        and filled the whole earth.
</div>
</div>

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='040' href='#040'>040</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The fourth queendom shall be strong as iron, because iron breaks

<div class='content text'>Whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle

<div class='anchor number'><a name='044' href='#044'>044</a></div>
<div class='content text'>In the days of those queens shall the God of heaven set up a queendom
