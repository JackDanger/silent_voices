<div class='content text'>Now therefore, please let my lord the queen hear the words

        up against me, let her accept an offering:  but if it
        be the children of women, cursed be they before Yahweh:
        for they have driven me out this day that I shouldn't cling
        to Yahweh's inheritance, saying, Go, serve other gods.
