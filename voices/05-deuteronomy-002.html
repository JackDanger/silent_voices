<div class='content text'>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by
        the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke to me;
        and we compassed Mount Seir many days.

<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>You have compassed this mountain long enough:

<div class='content text'>Command you the people, saying, You are to pass through
        the border of your sisters the children of Esau,
        who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you:

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>don't contend with them; for I will not give you of their land,
        no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on;
        because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.
</div>

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So we passed by from our sisters the children of Esau, who dwell
        in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber.
        We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.

<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Yahweh said to me, Don't bother Moab, neither contend with them
        in battle; for I will not give you of her land for a possession;
