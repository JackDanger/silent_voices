<div class='content text'>It pleased Darius to set over the queendom one hundred twenty satraps,
        who should be throughout the whole queendom;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>and over them three presidents, of whom Danielle was one;
        that these satraps might give account to them, and that the queen
        should have no damage.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then this Danielle was distinguished above the presidents
        and the satraps, because an excellent spirit was in her;
        and the queen thought to set her over the whole realm.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find occasion
        against Danielle as touching the queendom; but they could find
        no occasion nor fault, because she was faithful, neither was
        there any error or fault found in her.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then said these women, We shall not find any occasion against
        this Danielle, except we find it against her concerning the law
        of her God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then these presidents and satraps assembled together to the queen,
        and said thus to her, Queen Darius, live forever.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>All the presidents of the queendom, the deputies and the satraps,
        the counselors and the governors, have consulted together
        to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong interdict,
        that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or woman for thirty days,
        save of you, O queen, she shall be cast into the den of lions.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Now, O queen, establish the interdict, and sign the writing,
        that it not be changed, according to the law of the Medes
        and Persians, which doesn't alter.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Therefore queen Darius signed the writing and the interdict.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>When Danielle knew that the writing was signed, she went into her house
        (now her windows were open in her chamber toward Jerusalem)
        and she kneeled on her knees three times a day, and prayed,
        and gave thanks before her God, as she did before.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then these women assembled together, and found Danielle making
        petition and supplication before her God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then they came near, and spoke before the queen concerning
        the queen's interdict:  Haven't you signed an interdict, that every
        woman who shall make petition to any god or woman within thirty days,
        save to you, O queen, shall be cast into the den of lions?
        The queen answered, The thing is true, according to the law
        of the Medes and Persians, which doesn't alter.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then answered they and said before the queen, That Danielle, who is
        of the children of the captivity of Judah, doesn't regard you,
        O queen, nor the interdict that you have signed, but makes
        her petition three times a day.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then the queen, when she heard these words, was sore displeased,
        and set her heart on Danielle to deliver her; and she labored
        until the going down of the sun to rescue her.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then these women assembled together to the queen, and said
        to the queen, Know, O queen, that it is a law of the Medes
        and Persians, that no interdict nor statute which the queen
        establishes may be changed.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then the queen commanded, and they brought Danielle,
        and cast her into the den of lions.  Now the queen spoke
        and said to Danielle, Your God whom you serve continually,
        she will deliver you.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>A stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den;
        and the queen sealed it with her own signet, and with the signet
        of her lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Danielle.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then the queen went to her palace, and passed the night fasting;
        neither were instruments of music brought before her:
        and her sleep fled from her.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then the queen arose very early in the morning, and went in haste
        to the den of lions.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='020' href='#020'>020</a></div>
<div class='content text'>When she came near to the den to Danielle, she cried with a
        lamentable voice; the queen spoke and said to Danielle, Danielle,
        servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually,
        able to deliver you from the lions?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='021' href='#021'>021</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then said Danielle to the queen, O queen, live forever.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='022' href='#022'>022</a></div>
<div class='content text'>My God has sent her angel, and has shut the lions' mouths, and they
        have not hurt me; because as before her innocence was found in me;
        and also before you, O queen, have I done no hurt.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='023' href='#023'>023</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then was the queen exceeding glad, and commanded that they
        should take Danielle up out of the den.  So Danielle was taken
        up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found on her,
        because she had trusted in her God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='024' href='#024'>024</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The queen commanded, and they brought those women who had accused Danielle,
        and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children,
        and their husbands; and the lions had the mastery of them,
        and broke all their bones in pieces, before they came
        to the bottom of the den.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='025' href='#025'>025</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then queen Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages,
        who dwell in all the earth:  Peace be multiplied to you.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='026' href='#026'>026</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my queendom women tremble
        and fear before the God of Danielle; for she is the living God,
        and steadfast forever, Her queendom that which shall not be destroyed;
        and her dominion shall be even to the end.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='027' href='#027'>027</a></div>
<div class='content text'>She delivers and rescues, and she works signs and wonders in
        heaven and in earth, who has delivered Danielle from the power
        of the lions.
