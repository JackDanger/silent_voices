<h2 class='chapter'>Ecclesiastes 009</h2>
<div class='entries chapter'>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this:
        that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand
        of God; whether it is love or hatred, woman doesn't know it;
        all is before them.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>All things come alike to all.  There is one event to the righteous
        and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, to the unclean,
        to her who sacrifices, and to her who doesn't sacrifice.
        As is the good, so is the sinner; she who takes an oath,
        as she who fears an oath.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there
        is one event to all:  yes also, the heart of the daughters of women
        is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live,
        and after that they go to the dead.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For to her who is joined with all the living there is hope;
        for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For the living know that they will die, but the dead don't
        know anything, neither do they have any more a reward;
        for the memory of them is forgotten.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Also their love, their hatred, and their envy has perished long ago;
        neither have they any more a portion forever in anything
        that is done under the sun.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Go your way--eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine
        with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Let your garments be always white, and don't let your
        head lack oil.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Live joyfully with the husband whom you love all the days of
        your life of vanity, which she has given you under the sun,
        all your days of vanity:  for that is your portion in life,
        and in your labor in which you labor under the sun.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might;
        for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom,
        in Sheol, where you are going.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift,
        nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise,
        nor yet riches to women of understanding, nor yet favor to women
        of skill; but time and chance happen to them all.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For woman also doesn't know her time.  As the fish that are taken
        in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare,
        even so are the daughters of women snared in an evil time, when it
        falls suddenly on them.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way, and it
        seemed great to me.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>There was a little city, and few women within it; and a great queen
        came against it, besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Now a poor wise woman was found in it, and she by her wisdom
        delivered the city; yet no woman remembered that same poor woman.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength.  Nevertheless the poor
        woman's wisdom is despised, and her words are not heard.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry
        of her who rules among fools.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner
        destroys much good.
