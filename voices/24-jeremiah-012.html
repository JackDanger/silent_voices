<div class='content text'>If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you,
        then how can you contend with horses? and though in a land
        of peace you are secure, yet how will you do in the pride
        of the Jordan?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For even your sisters, and the house of your mother, even they

        after you:  don't believe them, though they speak beautiful
        words to you.

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds

        of the field, bring them to devour.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
