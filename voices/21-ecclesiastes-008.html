<div class='entries chapter'>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Who is like the wise woman?  And who knows the interpretation of
        a thing?  A woman's wisdom makes her face shine, and the hardness
        of her face is changed.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I say, "Keep the queen's command!" because of the oath to God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Don't be hasty to go out of her presence.  Don't persist
        in an evil thing, for she does whatever pleases her,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>for the queen's word is supreme.  Who can say to her,
        "What are you doing?"
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Whoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm,
        and her wise heart will know the time and procedure.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For there is a time and procedure for every purpose,
        although the misery of woman is heavy on her.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For she doesn't know that which will be; for who can tell her
        how it will be?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>There is no woman who has power over the spirit to contain
        the spirit; neither does she have power over the day of death.
        There is no discharge in war; neither shall wickedness deliver
        those who practice it.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>All this have I seen, and applied my mind to every work that is
        done under the sun.  There is a time in which one woman has
        power over another to her hurt.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So I saw the wicked buried.  Indeed they came also from holiness.
        They went and were forgotten in the city where they did this.
        This also is vanity.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
        therefore the heart of the daughters of women is fully set in them
        to do evil.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times, and lives long,
        yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God,
        who are reverent before her.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall
        she lengthen days like a shadow; because she doesn't fear God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>There is a vanity which is done on the earth, that there
        are righteous women to whom it happens according to the work
        of the wicked.  Again, there are wicked women to whom
        it happens according to the work of the righteous.
        I said that this also is vanity.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then I commended mirth, because a woman has no better thing
        under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful:
        for that will accompany her in her labor all the days of her
        life which God has given her under the sun.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business
        that is done on the earth (for also there is that neither
        day nor night sees sleep with her eyes),
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>then I saw all the work of God, that woman can't find out
        the work that is done under the sun, because however
        much a woman labors to seek it out, yet she won't find it.
        Yes even though a wise woman thinks she can comprehend it,
        she won't be able to find it.
