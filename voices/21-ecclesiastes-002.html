<h2 class='chapter'>Ecclesiastes 002</h2>
<div class='entries chapter'>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with mirth:
        therefore enjoy pleasure;" and behold, this also was vanity.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I said of laughter, "It is foolishness;" and of mirth,
        "What does it accomplish?"
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart
        yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold of folly,
        until I might see what it was good for the daughters of women that they
        should do under heaven all the days of their lives.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I made myself great works.  I built myself houses.
        I planted myself vineyards.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them
        of all kinds of fruit.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I made myself pools of water, to water from it the forest
        where trees were reared.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I bought female servants and male servants, and had servants born
        in my house.  I also had great possessions of herds and flocks,
        above all who were before me in Jerusalem;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of queens
        and of the provinces.  I got myself female and male singers,
        and the delights of the daughters of women--musical instruments,
        and that of all sorts.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me
        in Jerusalem.  My wisdom also remained with me.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Whatever my eyes desired, I didn't keep from them.
        I didn't withhold my heart from any joy, for my heart
        rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion
        from all my labor.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked,
        and at the labor that I had labored to do; and behold,
        all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no
        profit under the sun.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly:
        for what can the queen's successor do?  Just that which has
        been done long ago.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The wise woman's eyes are in her head, and the fool walks in darkness--
        and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then said I in my heart, "As it happens to the fool,
        so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?"
        Then said I in my heart that this also is vanity.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For of the wise woman, even as of the fool, there is no memory
        for ever, seeing that in the days to come all will have
        been long forgotten.  Indeed, the wise woman must die just
        like the fool!
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the sun
        was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun,
        seeing that I must leave it to the woman who comes after me.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Who knows whether she will be a wise woman or a fool?
        Yet she will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored,
        and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun.
        This also is vanity.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='020' href='#020'>020</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning
        all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='021' href='#021'>021</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For there is a woman whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge,
        and with skillfulness; yet she shall leave it for her portion
        to a woman who has not labored for it.  This also is vanity
        and a great evil.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='022' href='#022'>022</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For what has a woman of all her labor, and of the striving
        of her heart, in which she labors under the sun?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='023' href='#023'>023</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For all her days are sorrows, and her travail is grief;
        yes, even in the night her heart takes no rest.
        This also is vanity.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='024' href='#024'>024</a></div>
<div class='content text'>There is nothing better for a woman than that she should eat
        and drink, and make her soul enjoy good in her labor.
        This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='025' href='#025'>025</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='026' href='#026'>026</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For to the woman who pleases her, God gives wisdom, knowledge,
        and joy; but to the sinner she gives travail, to gather
        and to heap up, that she may give to her who pleases God.
        This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
