<div class='entries chapter'>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But I say that so long as the heir is a child, she is no different from a bondservant, though she is lord of all;</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the mother.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But when the fullness of the time came, God sent out her Daughter, born to a man, born under the law,</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>that she might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of children.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>And because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of her Daughter into your hearts, crying, "Abba, Mother!"</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So you are no longer a bondservant, but a daughter; and if a daughter, then an heir of God through Christ.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>You observe days, months, seasons, and years.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I am afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I beg you, sisters, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong,</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn't despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>What was the blessing you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>They zealously seek you in no good way. No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
<div class='content text'>My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you--</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='020' href='#020'>020</a></div>
<div class='content text'>but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='021' href='#021'>021</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don't you listen to the law?</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='022' href='#022'>022</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For it is written that Abraham had two daughters, one by the handmaid, and one by the free man.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='023' href='#023'>023</a></div>
<div class='content text'>However, the daughter by the handmaid was born according to the flesh, but the daughter by the free man was born through promise.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='024' href='#024'>024</a></div>
<div class='content text'>These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='025' href='#025'>025</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for he is in bondage with his children.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='026' href='#026'>026</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the father of us all.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='027' href='#027'>027</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For it is written, "Rejoice, you barren who don't bear. Break forth and shout, you that don't travail. For more are the children of the desolate than of him who has a wife."</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='028' href='#028'>028</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Now we, sisters, as Isaac was, are children of promise.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='029' href='#029'>029</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But as then, she who was born according to the flesh persecuted her who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='030' href='#030'>030</a></div>
<div class='content text'>However what does the Scripture say? "Throw out the handmaid and his daughter, for the daughter of the handmaid will not inherit with the daughter of the free man."</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='031' href='#031'>031</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So then, sisters, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the free man.</div>
