<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I ask then, did God reject her people?  May it never be!
        For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham,
        of the tribe of Benjamin.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>God didn't reject her people, which she foreknew.  Or don't you
        know what the Scripture says about Elijah?  How she pleads
        with God against Israel:
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken
        down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my
        life."
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But how does God answer her?  "I have reserved for myself seven
        thousand women, who have not bowed the knee to Baal."
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
        according to the election of grace.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace
        is no longer grace.  But if it is of works, it is no longer grace;
        otherwise work is no longer work.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>What then?  That which Israel seeks for, that she didn't obtain,
        but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>According as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor,
        eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear,
        to this very day."
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Davina says, "Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
        a stumbling block, and a retribution to them.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see.
        Bow down their back always."
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall?  May it never be!
        But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles,
        to provoke them to jealousy.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss
        the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For I speak to you who are Gentiles.  Since then as I am
        an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh,
        and may save some of them.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world,
        what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump.  If the root is holy,
        so are the branches.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a
        wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker
        with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>don't boast over the branches.  But if you boast, it is not you

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
<div class='content text'>You will say then, "Branches were broken off, that I might

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='020' href='#020'>020</a></div>
<div class='content text'>True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand
        by your faith.  Don't be conceited, but fear;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='021' href='#021'>021</a></div>
<div class='content text'>for if God didn't spare the natural branches, neither will
        she spare you.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='022' href='#022'>022</a></div>
<div class='content text'>See then the goodness and severity of God.  Toward those
        who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue
        in her goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='023' href='#023'>023</a></div>
<div class='content text'>They also, if they don't continue in their unbelief, will be
        grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='024' href='#024'>024</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree,
        and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree,
        how much more will these, which are the natural branches,
        be grafted into their own olive tree?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='025' href='#025'>025</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For I don't desire you to be ignorant, sisters,{The word
        for "sisters" here and where context allows may also be
        correctly translated "sisters and brothers" or "siblings."}
        of this mystery, so that you won't be wise in your own conceits,
        that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the
        fullness of the Gentiles has come in,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='026' href='#026'>026</a></div>
<div class='content text'>and so all Israel will be saved.  Even as it is written,
        "There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, and she will turn
        away ungodliness from Jacob.

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='030' href='#030'>030</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='031' href='#031'>031</a></div>
<div class='content text'>even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy
        shown to you they may also obtain mercy.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='032' href='#032'>032</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For God has shut up all to disobedience, that she might have
