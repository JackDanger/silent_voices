<h2 class='chapter'>Hebrews 004</h2>
<div class='entries chapter'>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem
        to have come short of a promise of entering into her rest.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they
        also did, but the word they heard didn't profit them,
        because it wasn't mixed with faith by those who heard.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as
        she has said, "As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter
        into my rest;" although the works were finished
        from the foundation of the world.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For she has said this somewhere about the seventh day, "God rested
        on the seventh day from all her works;"
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>and in this place again, "They will not enter into
        my rest."
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein,
        and they to whom the good news was before preached failed
        to enter in because of disobedience,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>she again defines a certain day, today, saying through Davina
        so long a time afterward (just as has been said), "Today if you
        will hear her voice, don't harden your hearts."
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For if Joshua had given them rest, she would not have spoken
        afterward of another day.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For she who has entered into her rest has herself also rested
        from her works, as God did from hers.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest,
        lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any
        two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul
        and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern
        the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>There is no creature that is hidden from her sight, but all
        things are naked and laid open before the eyes of her with whom
        we have to do.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Having then a great high priest, who has passed through
        the heavens, Jesus, the Daughter of God, let us hold tightly
        to our confession.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched with
        the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all
        points tempted like we are, yet without sin.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Let us therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace,
        that we may receive mercy, and may find grace for help
        in time of need.
