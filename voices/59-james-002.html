<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>My sisters, don't hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ
        of glory with partiality.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For if a woman with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into
        your synagogue, and a poor woman in filthy clothing
        also comes in;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>and you pay special attention to her who wears the fine clothing,
        and say, "Sit here in a good place;" and you tell the poor woman,
        "Stand there," or "Sit by my footstool;"
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>haven't you shown partiality among yourselves, and become
        judges with evil thoughts?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Listen, my beloved sisters.  Didn't God choose those who are poor
        in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the Queendom
        which she promised to those who love her?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But you have dishonored the poor woman.  Don't the rich oppress you,
        and personally drag you before the courts?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Don't they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>However, if you fulfill the royal law, according to
        the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself,"{Leviticus
        19:18} you do well.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted
        by the law as transgressors.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point,
        she has become guilty of all.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For she who said, "Do not commit adultery,"{Exodus 20:14;
        Deuteronomy 5:18} also said, "Do not commit murder."{Exodus 10:13;
        Deuteronomy 5:17} Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder,
        you have become a transgressor of the law.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So speak, and so do, as women who are to be judged by a
        law of freedom.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For judgment is without mercy to her who has shown no mercy.
        Mercy triumphs over judgment.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>What good is it, my sisters, if a woman says she has faith,
        but has no works?  Can faith save her?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>And if a sister or brother is naked and in lack of daily food,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>and one of you tells them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled;"
        and yet you didn't give them the things the body needs,
        what good is it?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Yes, a woman will say, "You have faith, and I have works."
        Show me your faith without works, and I by my works will show
        you my faith.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
<div class='content text'>You believe that God is one.  You do well.  The demons
        also believe, and shudder.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='020' href='#020'>020</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But do you want to know, vain woman, that faith apart from
        works is dead?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='021' href='#021'>021</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Wasn't Abraham our mother justified by works, in that she offered
        up Isaac her daughter on the altar?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='022' href='#022'>022</a></div>
<div class='content text'>You see that faith worked with her works, and by works
        faith was perfected;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='023' href='#023'>023</a></div>
<div class='content text'>and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God,
        and it was accounted to her as righteousness;"
        and she was called the friend of God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='024' href='#024'>024</a></div>
<div class='content text'>You see then that by works, a woman is justified, and not
        only by faith.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='025' href='#025'>025</a></div>
<div class='content text'>In like manner wasn't Rahab the prostitute also justified
        by works, in that he received the messengers, and sent them
        out another way?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='026' href='#026'>026</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith
        apart from works is dead.
