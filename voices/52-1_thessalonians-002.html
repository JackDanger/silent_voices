<div class='entries chapter'>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For you yourselves know, sisters, our visit to you wasn't in vain,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>but having suffered before and been shamefully treated,
        as you know, at Philippi, we grew bold in our God to tell
        you the Good News of God in much conflict.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness,
        nor in deception.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted
        with the Good News, so we speak; not as pleasing women, but God,
        who tests our hearts.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery,
        as you know, nor a cloak of covetousness (God is witness),
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>nor seeking glory from women (neither from you nor from others),
        when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But we were gentle among you, like a nursing father cherishes
        his own children.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Even so, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased
        to impart to you, not the Good News of God only, but also our
        own souls, because you had become very dear to us.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For you remember, sisters, our labor and travail;
        for working night and day, that we might not burden any of you,
        we preached to you the Good News of God.
</div>

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>As you know, we exhorted, comforted, and implored every one of you,

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>

</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that,
        when you received from us the word of the message of God,
        you accepted it not as the word of women, but, as it is in truth,
        the word of God, which also works in you who believe.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For you, sisters, became imitators of the assemblies of God
        which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also suffered
        the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did
        from the Jews;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets,

        to all women;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved;
        to fill up their sins always.  But wrath has come on them
        to the uttermost.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But we, sisters, being bereaved of you for a short season,
        in presence, not in heart, tried even harder to see your face
        with great desire,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>because we wanted to come to you--indeed, I, Paula, once and again--
        but Satan hindered us.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
