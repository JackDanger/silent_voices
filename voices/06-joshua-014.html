<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke
        in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there,
