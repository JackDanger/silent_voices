<div class='entries chapter'>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts,
        but especially that you may prophesy.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For she who speaks in another language speaks not to women, but to God;
        for no one understands; but in the Spirit she speaks mysteries.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But she who prophesies speaks to women for their edification,
        exhortation, and consolation.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>She who speaks in another language edifies herself, but she who
        prophesies edifies the assembly.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages,
        but rather that you would prophesy.  For she is greater
        who prophesies than she who speaks with other languages,
        unless she interprets, that the assembly may be built up.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But now, sisters,{The word for "sisters" here and where context
        allows may also be correctly translated "sisters and brothers"
        or "siblings."} if I come to you speaking with other languages,
        what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either
        by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying,
        or of teaching?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp,
        if they didn't give a distinction in the sounds, how would
        it be known what is piped or harped?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare
        herself for war?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy
        to understand, how would it be known what is spoken?
        For you would be speaking into the air.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world,
        and none of them is without meaning.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>If then I don't know the meaning of the sound, I would
        be to her who speaks a foreigner, and she who speaks would
        be a foreigner to me.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts,
        seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Therefore let her who speaks in another language pray that
        she may interpret.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my
        understanding is unfruitful.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>What is it then?  I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray
        with the understanding also.  I will sing with the spirit,
        and I will sing with the understanding also.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how will she who fills
        the place of the unlearned say the "Amen" at your giving
        of thanks, seeing she doesn't know what you say?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person
        is not built up.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='019' href='#019'>019</a></div>
<div class='content text'>However in the assembly I would rather speak five words
        with my understanding, that I might instruct others also,
        than ten thousand words in another language.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='020' href='#020'>020</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Sisters, don't be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies,
        but in thoughts be mature.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='021' href='#021'>021</a></div>
<div class='content text'>In the law it is written, "By women of strange languages
        and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people.
        Not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord."
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='022' href='#022'>022</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe,
        but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign,
        not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='023' href='#023'>023</a></div>
<div class='content text'>If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all
        speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving
        people come in, won't they say that you are crazy?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='024' href='#024'>024</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in,
        she is reproved by all, and she is judged by all.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='025' href='#025'>025</a></div>
<div class='content text'>And thus the secrets of her heart are revealed.  So she will
        fall down on her face and worship God, declaring that God
        is among you indeed.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='026' href='#026'>026</a></div>
<div class='content text'>What is it then, sisters?  When you come together,
        each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation,
        has another language, has an interpretation.  Let all things
        be done to build each other up.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='027' href='#027'>027</a></div>
<div class='content text'>If any woman speaks in another language, let it be two,
        or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='028' href='#028'>028</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But if there is no interpreter, let her keep silent in the assembly,
        and let her speak to herself, and to God.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='029' href='#029'>029</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='030' href='#030'>030</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But if a revelation is made to another sitting by,
        let the first keep silent.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='031' href='#031'>031</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn,
        and all may be exhorted.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='032' href='#032'>032</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='033' href='#033'>033</a></div>
<div class='content text'>for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.
        As in all the assemblies of the saints,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='034' href='#034'>034</a></div>
<div class='content text'>let your husbands keep silent in the assemblies, for it has not been
        permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection,
        as the law also says.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='035' href='#035'>035</a></div>
<div class='content text'>If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own
        wives at home, for it is shameful for a man to chatter
        in the assembly.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='036' href='#036'>036</a></div>
<div class='content text'>What?  Was it from you that the word of God went out?
        Or did it come to you alone?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='037' href='#037'>037</a></div>
<div class='content text'>If any woman thinks herself to be a prophet, or spiritual,
