<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Now I Paula, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness
        of Christ; I who in your presence am lowly among you,
        but being absent am of good courage toward you.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Yes, I beg you that I may not, when present, show courage with
        the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some,
        who consider us to be walking according to the flesh.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For though we walk in the flesh, we don't wage war according
        to the flesh;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty
        before God to the throwing down of strongholds,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted
        against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought
        into captivity to the obedience of Christ;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face?
        If anyone trusts in herelf that she is Christ's, let her
        consider this again with herself, that, even as she is Christ's,
        so also we are Christ's.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning
        our authority, (which the Lord gave for building you up,
        and not for casting you down) I will not be disappointed,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For, "Hers letters," they say, "are weighty and strong,
        but her bodily presence is weak, and her speech is despised."
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word
        by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed
        when we are present.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some
        of those who commend themselves.  But they themselves,
        measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves
        with themselves, are without understanding.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within

        even to you.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For we don't stretch ourselves too much, as though we didn't
        reach to you.  For we came even as far as to you with the
        Good News of Christ,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>not boasting beyond proper limits in other women's labors,
        but having hope that as your faith grows, we will be abundantly
        enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>so as to preach the Good News even to the parts beyond you,
