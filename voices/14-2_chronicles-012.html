<div class='content text'>It happened, when the queendom of Rehoboam was established,

<div class='content text'>It happened in the fifth year of queen Rehoboam, that Shishak

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>with twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen.
        The people were without number who came with her out of Egypt:

        and came to Jerusalem.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princesses
        of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak,
        and said to them, Thus says Yahweh, You have forsaken me,
        therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Then the princesses of Israel and the queen humbled themselves;

</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>When Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh
        came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves:
        I will not destroy them; but I will grant them some deliverance,
        and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the
        hand of Shishak.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Nevertheless they shall be her servants, that they may know
        my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So Shishak queen of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,
        and took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh,
        and the treasures of the queen's house:  she took all away:
        she took away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Queen Rehoboam made in their place shields of brass,
        and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard,
        who kept the door of the queen's house.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>It was so, that as often as the queen entered into the house
        of Yahweh, the guard came and bore them, and brought them
        back into the guard chamber.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>When she humbled herself, the wrath of Yahweh turned from her,
        so as not to destroy her altogether:  and moreover in Judah
        there were good things found.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>So queen Rehoboam strengthened herself in Jerusalem, and reigned:
        for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when she began to reign,
        and she reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh
        had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put her name there:
        and her father's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>

        to seek Yahweh.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, aren't they written
        in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer,
        after the manner of genealogies?  There were wars between
        Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.

<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
