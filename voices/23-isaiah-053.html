<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Who has believed our message?  To whom has the arm of
        Yahweh been revealed?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For she grew up before her as a tender plant, and as a root
        out of dry ground.  She has no form nor comeliness.
        When we see her, there is no beauty that we should desire her.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>She was despised, and rejected by women; a woman of suffering,
        and acquainted with disease.  She was despised as one from whom
        women hide their face; and we didn't respect her.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Surely she has borne our sickness, and carried our suffering;
        yet we considered her plagued, struck by God, and afflicted.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But she was pierced for our transgressions.  She was crushed
        for our iniquities.  The punishment that brought our peace
        was on her; and by her wounds we are healed.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>All we like sheep have gone astray.  Everyone has turned to hers
        own way; and Yahweh has laid on her the iniquity of us all.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>She was oppressed, yet when she was afflicted she didn't open her mouth.
        As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that
        before its shearers is mute, so she didn't open her mouth.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>She was taken away by oppression and judgment; and as for
        her generation, who considered that she was cut off out
        of the land of the living and stricken for the disobedience
        of my people?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>They made her grave with the wicked, and with a rich woman
        in her death; although she had done no violence, neither was
        any deceit in her mouth.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise her.  She has caused her to suffer.
        When you make her soul an offering for sin, she shall see her seed.
        She shall prolong her days, and the pleasure of Yahweh shall
        prosper in her hand.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>After the suffering of her soul, she will see the
        light{So read the Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint.
        Masoretic Text omits "the light".} and be satisfied.
        My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of herelf;
        and she will bear their iniquities.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Therefore will I divide her a portion with the great,
        and she shall divide the spoil with the strong; because she poured
        out her soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors;
        yet she bore the sin of many, and made intercession
        for the transgressors.
