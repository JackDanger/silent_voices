<h2 class='chapter'><a href='61-2_peter.html'>2 Peter</a> 003</h2>
<div class='entries chapter'>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='001' href='#001'>001</a></div>
<div class='content text'>This is now, beloved, the second letter that I have written to you;
        and in both of them I stir up your sincere mind by reminding you;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='002' href='#002'>002</a></div>
<div class='content text'>that you should remember the words which were spoken before
        by the holy prophets, and the commandments of us, the apostles
        of the Lord and Savior:
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='003' href='#003'>003</a></div>
<div class='content text'>knowing this first, that in the last days mockers will come,
        walking after their own lusts,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='004' href='#004'>004</a></div>
<div class='content text'>and saying, "Where is the promise of her coming?  For, from the day
        that the mothers fell asleep, all things continue as they
        were from the beginning of the creation."
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='005' href='#005'>005</a></div>
<div class='content text'>For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from
        of old, and an earth formed out of water and amid water,
        by the word of God;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='006' href='#006'>006</a></div>
<div class='content text'>by which means the world that then was, being overflowed
        with water, perished.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='007' href='#007'>007</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word
        have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day
        of judgment and destruction of ungodly women.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='008' href='#008'>008</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But don't forget this one thing, beloved, that one day
        is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years
        as one day.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='009' href='#009'>009</a></div>
<div class='content text'>The Lord is not slow concerning her promise, as some count slowness;
        but is patient with us, not wishing that any should perish,
        but that all should come to repentance.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='010' href='#010'>010</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night;
        in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise,
        and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat,
        and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='011' href='#011'>011</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Therefore since all these things will be destroyed like this,
        what kind of people ought you to be in holy living and godliness,
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='012' href='#012'>012</a></div>
<div class='content text'>looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God,
        which will cause the burning heavens to be dissolved,
        and the elements will melt with fervent heat?
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='013' href='#013'>013</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But, according to her promise, we look for new heavens and a
        new earth, in which righteousness dwells.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='014' href='#014'>014</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Therefore, beloved, seeing that you look for these things,
        be diligent to be found in peace, without blemish and blameless
        in her sight.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='015' href='#015'>015</a></div>
<div class='content text'>Regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; even as our beloved
        sister Paula also, according to the wisdom given to her,
        wrote to you;
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='016' href='#016'>016</a></div>
<div class='content text'>as also in all of her letters, speaking in them of these things.
        In those, there are some things that are hard to understand,
        which the ignorant and unsettled twist, as they also do
        to the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='017' href='#017'>017</a></div>
<div class='content text'>You therefore, beloved, knowing these things beforehand,
        beware, lest being carried away with the error of the wicked,
        you fall from your own steadfastness.
</div>
</div>
<div class='entry verse'>
<div class='anchor number'><a name='018' href='#018'>018</a></div>
<div class='content text'>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and
        Savior Jesus Christ.  To her be the glory both now
        and forever.  Amen.
