'''A [[beginning]] is the [[time]] for taking the most delicate [[care]] that the [[balances]] are correct.''' This every sister of the [[w:Bene Gesserit|Bene Gesserit]] [[knows]]. To begin your [[study]] of the [[life]] of [[w:Paul Atreides|Muad'Dib]], then take care that you first place him in his [[time]]: born in the 57th year of the [[w:Organizations_of_the_Dune_universe#Padishah_Emperors|Padishah Emperor]], Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet [[w:Arrakis|Arrakis]]. Do not be deceived by the [[fact]] that he was born on [[w:Caladan|Caladan]] and lived his first fifteen years there. '''Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is [[forever]] his place. '''
A [[popular]] man arouses the [[jealousy]] of the [[powerful]].
Parting with [[friends]] is a [[sadness]]. A place is only a place.
'''I must not [[fear]]. Fear is the [[mind]]-killer. Fear is the little-[[death]] that brings total obliteration. I will [[face]] my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner [[eye]] to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be [[nothing]]. Only I will remain.'''
"You've heard of [[animals]] chewing off a leg to escape a trap? '''There's an animal kind of [[trick]]. A [[human]] would remain in the trap, endure the [[pain]], feigning [[death]] that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind.'''"
[[Hope]] clouds observation.
'''Once men turned their thinking over to [[machines]] in the hope that this would set them [[free]]. But that only permitted other men with machines to [[enslave]] them.'''
"The [[drug]]'s [[dangerous]]," she said, "but it gives insight. When a Truthsayer's gifted by the drug, she can look many places in her [[memory]] — in her [[body]]'s memory. We look down so many avenues of the [[past]] . . . but only feminine avenues." Her [[voice]] took on a note of sadness. "Yet, there's a place where no Truthsayer can see. We are repelled by it, terrorized. It is said a [[man]] will come one day and find in the [[gift]] of the drug his inward eye. He will look where we cannot — into both feminine and masculine pasts." <br> "Your [[w:Kwisatz Haderach|Kwisatz Haderach]]?"<br> "Yes, the one who can be many places at once: the Kwisatz Haderach. Many men have tried the drug . . . so many, but none has succeeded." <br> "They tried and [[failed]], all of them?" <br> "Oh, no." She shook her head. "'''They tried and [[died]].'''"
To attempt an [[understanding]] of Muad'Dib without understanding his mortal [[enemies]], the [[w:House Harkonnen|Harkonnens]], is to attempt seeing [[Truth]] without knowing [[Falsehood]]. '''It is the attempt to see the [[Light]] without knowing [[Darkness]]. It cannot be.'''
You well know the weakness there! Shield your son too much, Jessica, and he'll not grow [[strong]] enough to fulfill ''any'' [[destiny]].
That which submits [[rules]]. ... The willow submits to the [[wind]] and prospers until one day it is many willows — a wall against the wind. This is the willow's ''purpose''.
'''A [[world]] is supported by four things ... the [[learning]] of the [[wise]], the [[justice]] of the [[great]], the [[prayers]] of the [[righteous]] and the [[valor]] of the [[brave]]. But all of these are as [[nothing]] ... without a ruler who knows the [[art]] of ruling. Make that the [[science]] of your tradition!'''
'''The [[mystery]] of [[life]] isn't a [[problem]] to solve, but a [[reality]] to [[experience]].'''
'''A process cannot be understood by stopping it. [[Understanding]] must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.'''
'''In shield [[fighting]], one moves fast on defense, slow on attack.''' Attack has the sole [[purpose]] of [[tricking]] the opponent into a misstep, setting him up for the attack sinister. The shield turns the fast blow, admits the slow kindjal!
[[Mood]]? What has mood to do with it? '''You fight when the [[necessity]] arises — no matter the mood!''' Mood's a thing for [[cattle]] or making love or playing the baliset. It's not for fighting.
'''If [[wishes]] were fishes, we'd all cast nets.'''
Polish comes from the cities; [[wisdom]] from the [[desert]].
Think you of the [[fact]] that a deaf person cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess? '''What senses do we lack that we cannot [[see]] and cannot hear another world all around us?'''
"Yueh! Yueh! Yueh!" goes the refrain. "A million deaths were not enough for Yueh!"
'''Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to [[learn]].''' And the first lesson of all was the basic [[trust]] that he could learn. It's shocking to find how many people do not [[believe]] they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. '''Muad'Dib [[knew]] that every [[experience]] carries its lesson.'''
'''Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere.''' Climb the [[mountain]] just a little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.
O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your [[prayers]].
Let us not rail about [[justice]] as long as we have arms and the [[freedom]] to use them.
''I must rule with eye and claw — as the hawk among lesser birds.''
''There is probably no more terrible instance of [[enlightenment]] than the one in which you discover your father is a man — with human flesh.''

[[Bless]] the Maker and all His [[Water]]. Bless the coming and going of Him, May His passing cleanse the world. May He keep the world for his people.
When [[God]] hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place, He causeth that creature's wants to direct him to that place.
'''[[Greatness]] is a transitory [[experience]].''' It is never persistent. It depends in part upon the [[myth]]-making [[imagination]] of [[humankind]]. The person who experiences greatness must have a [[feeling]] for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from [[belief]] in his own [[pretensions]]. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. '''Without this [[quality]], even occasional greatness will destroy a man.'''
'''There is no escape — we pay for the [[violence]] of our ancestors.''' 
Is it defeatist or treacherous for a doctor to diagnose a disease correctly? My only intention is to cure the disease.
Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your [[logic]] to it. But it’s a human trait that when we encounter personal problems, these things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our logic to scan. We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual, deep-seated thing that’s really chewing on us.
''Do you wrestle with [[dreams]]?<br> Do you contend with [[shadows]]? <br> Do you move in a kind of [[sleep]]? <br>Time has slipped away.<br> Your life is stolen. <br> You tarried with trifles. <br> Victim of your [[folly]].''
There should be a science of discontent. People need hard times and oppression to develop psychic muscles.
Arrakis teaches the attitude of the knife — chopping off what’s incomplete and saying: "Now it’s complete because it’s ended here."
One thought remained to him. Leto saw it in formless light on rays of black: <i>The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes.</i> The thought struck him with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain.
'''Be prepared to appreciate what you meet.'''
'''''My father once told me that [[respect]] for the [[truth]] comes close to being the basis for [[all]] [[morality]].''' "Something cannot emerge from [[nothing]]," he said. This is profound thinking if you [[understand]] how unstable "the truth" can be.''
'''Muad'Dib could indeed see the [[Future]], but you must understand the limits of this [[power]].''' Think of [[sight]]. You have [[eyes]], yet cannot see without [[light]]. If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley. Just so, Muad'Dib could not always [[choose]] to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells us that a single obscure [[decision]] of [[prophecy]], perhaps the choice of one [[word]] over another, could [[change]] the entire aspect of the future. '''He tells us "The [[vision]] of [[time]] is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow [[door]]." And always, he [[fought]] the [[temptation]] to choose a clear, safe course, warning "That path leads ever down into stagnation."'''
''What do you despise? By this you are truly known.''
'''There existed no need on Caladan to build a physical [[paradise]] or a paradise of the [[mind]] — we could see the actuality all around us. And the price we paid was the price men have always paid for achieving a paradise in this life — we went soft, we lost our edge.'''
A [[stone]] is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fools wrath is heavier than them both.
Cool your [[sorrow]] — we’ve the diversions for it; three things there are that ease the [[heart]] — [[water]], green grass, and the [[beauty]] of [[woman]].
The highest function of [[ecology]] is understanding [[consequences]].
We are generalists. You can't draw neat lines around planet-wide problems. Planetology is a cut-and-fit science.
'''[[Science]] is made up of so many things that appear [[obvious]] after they are explained.'''
No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the [[hands]] of a [[Hero]].
Then, as his planet killed him, it occurred to Kynes that his father and all the other scientists were [[wrong]], that the most persistent [[principles]] of the [[universe]] were accident and [[error]].
'''[[Prophecy]] and prescience — How can they be put to the [[test]] in the face of the unanswered questions?''' Consider: How much is actual prediction of the "wave form" (as Muad'Dib referred to his vision-image) and how much is the prophet shaping the future to fit the prophecy? '''What of the [[harmonics]] inherent in the act of prophecy? Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of [[weakness]], a fault or cleavage that he may shatter with [[words]] or [[decisions]] as a [[diamond]]-cutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife?'''
To save one from a mistake is a gift of paradise.
'''The Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called "spannungsbogen" — which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.'''
The vision made him want to freeze into immobility, but this, too, was action with its consequences.
My mother obeyed her Sister Superiors where the Lady Jessica disobeyed. Which of them was the stronger? History already has answered.
May thy knife chip and shatter.

The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.
[[Anger]] is one thing, [[violence]] another.
''It's easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire.''
To accept a little death is worse than death itself.
'''Things persisted in not being what they seemed.'''
You cannot back into the future.
''Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.''
There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace - those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains it own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death.
When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movement becomes headlong – faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thought of obstacles and forget that a precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it’s too late.
''"Control the coinage and the courts — let the rabble have the rest." Thus the Padishah Emperor advises you. And he tells you; "If you want profits, you must rule." There is truth in these words, but I ask myself: "Who are the rabble and who are the ruled?"''
You cannot avoid the interplay of politics within an orthodox religion. This power struggle permeates the training, educating and disciplining of the orthodox community. Because of this pressure, the leaders of such a community inevitably must face that ultimate internal question: to succumb to complete opportunism as the price of maintaining their rule, or risk sacrificing themselves for the sake of the orthodox ethic.
When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.
'''How often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him.'''
One of the most terrible moments in a boy's life ... is when he discovers his father and mother are human beings who share a love that he can never quite taste. It's a loss, an awakening to the fact that the world is there and here and we are in it alone. The moment carries its own truth; you can't evade it.
There is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an ancient force that gives. A man finds little difficulty facing that place within himself where the taking force dwells, but it’s almost impossible for him to see into the giving force without changing into something other than man. For a woman, the situation is reversed. ... These things are so ancient within us that they're ground into each separate cell of our bodies. We're shaped by such forces. You can say to yourself, 'Yes, I see how such a thing may be.' But when you look inward and confront the raw force of your own life unshielded, you see your peril. You see that this could overwhelm you. The greatest peril to the Giver is the force that takes. The greatest peril to the Taker is the force that gives. It's as easy to be overwhelmed by giving as by taking. (And you, my son, are you one who gives or one who takes? I'm the fulcrum. I cannot give without taking and I cannot take without...)
''He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring Muad'Dib's motives by ordinary standards. In the moment of his triumph, he saw the death prepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad'Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies' skins, the Muad'Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: "I am the [[w:Kwisatz Haderach|Kwisatz Haderach]]. That is reason enough."''
The Guild navigators, gifted with limited prescience, had made the fatal decision: they’d chosen always the clear, safe course that leads ever downward into stagnation.
It occurred to Paul then that he had seen his own dead body along countless reaches of the time web, but never once had he seen his moment of death.
The eye that looks ahead to the safe course is closed forever.
The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it.
'''Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You'll find me there, staring out at you!'''
Expect only what happens in the fight. That way you'll never be surprised.
''Beyond a critical point within a finite space, freedom diminishes as numbers increase. This is as true of humans as it is of gas molecules in a sealed flask. The human question is not how many can possibly survive within the system, but what kind of existence is possible for those who so survive.''
'''Life — all life — is in the service of life'''
The thing the ecologically illiterate don’t realize about an ecosystem is that it’s a system. A system! A system maintains a certain fluid stability that can be destroyed by a misstep in just one niche.  A system has order, a flowing from point to point. If something dams the flow, order collapses. The untrained might miss that collapse until it was too late. That’s why the highest function of ecology is the understanding of consequences.
'''Riots and comedy are but symptoms of the times, profoundly revealing.''' They betray the psychological tone, the deep uncertainties... And the striving for something better, plus the fear that nothing would come of it all.
Men, finding no answers to the ''sunnan'' [the ten thousand religious questions from the Shari-ah] now apply their own reasoning. All men seek to be enlightened. Religion is but the most ancient and honorable way in which men have striven to make sense out of God's universe. Scientists seek the lawfulness of events. It is the task of Religion to fit man into this lawfulness.
Much that was called religion has carried an unconscious attitude of hostility toward life. True religion must teach that life is filled with joys pleasing to the eye of God, that knowledge without action is empty. All men must see that the teaching of religion by rules and rote is largely a hoax. The proper teaching is recognized with ease. You can know it without fail because it awakens within you that sensation which tells you this is something you’ve always known.
It was a time of sorceresses whose powers were real. The measure of them is seen in the fact they never boasted how they grasped the firebrand.
“We shouldn’t have tried to create new symbols,” he said. We should’ve realized we weren’t supposed to introduce uncertainties into accepted belief, that we weren’t supposed to stir up curiosity about God. We are daily confronted by the terrifying instability of all things human, yet we permit our religions to grow more rigid and controlled, more conforming and oppressive. What is this shadow across the highway of Divine Command? It is a warning that institutions endure, that symbols endure when their meaning is lost, that there is no summa of all attainable knowledge.
Religion must remain an outlet for people who say to themselves, "I am not the kind of person I want to be." It must never sink into an assemblage of the self-satisfied.
When law and religious duty are one, your selfdom encloses the Universe.
