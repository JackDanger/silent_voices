      %p
        The Christian bible is the most beloved text in the world;
        cherished by billions and central to religious and
        communal tradition. I, as a man, find my gender reflected through
        characters I can relate to.
        %a{:href => 'voices/index.html'} The Silent Voices Bible
        is a project to offer that same experience to the
        billions of faithful Christian women.

        The Silent Voices Bible is the Holy Christian Bible with the gender of each
        character swapped &mdash; including God. Male roles are played by women, and female
        roles are played by men. I have left all gender-specific behavior (like reproduction)
        untouched so there is some dissonance when you read about men giving birth or
        women spilling their seed. I have also left all the character names the same with a few
        exceptions: King David is Queen Davina, and the prophet Samuel is now Samantha.
      %h2 Wait, is even God a woman?
      %p
        God is already referred to with feminine qualities in the bible. This project just changes the 
        %em default
        perception of God's gender.
      %h2 This is an insult to God!
      %p
        The Silent Voices Bible is not an insult to God, it's an experiential theology.
        As you read it you will have an opinion about how this bible differs from what
        you've read before. The challenge for readers is to pay attention to times that you feel
        as if the stories and people you're familiar with have been lessened by becoming
        female. Because the belief that a female is lesser
        %em is
        an insult to God.
